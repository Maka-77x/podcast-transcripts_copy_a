Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,840
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
Hey Chris, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,200
Hey man, thanks for having me. It's good to be on here.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,160
Yeah, thanks. I know you a long time. We knew of each other, I think, for a very long time,

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,960
and then we finally met, I think, when you started at Mozilla. Was that it?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,920
I think so. It was 2013, although I seem to remember that we were talking about web

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,280
standards and JavaScript and stuff way back when I worked at Opera, because if you recall,

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:53,280
when we did the learning area on MDN, that was pretty much the kind of the next step

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,600
from my original educational project, which was the open the web standards curriculum at Opera,

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,520
and I got you to write some content for that back in about 2008 or 2009 or something. So,

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:14,640
you know, it's been a very long time. I think the number of grey hairs in our beards are testimony

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,040
to, you know, all of the blood, sweat and tears that we've poured into this industry.

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
Yeah, that's for sure. That's for sure. But it's still a good, I think it's still a good industry

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:32,160
to be in with all the problems that it has. For sure. So, to get us started, tell us about

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,840
who is Chris Mills, what you've been up to, what got you to where you are today, and, like,

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:46,640
maybe a little bit of looking forward as well. Okay. So, like all of the best people in the

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,480
open standards community, I didn't do any kind of formal education in development or programming

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,520
or computer science or anything like that. I was always super interested in technology

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,920
from when I was really young. I do remember doing my first bits of programming on a ZX Spectrum 48

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,040
plus back in probably the late 80s or something, and that was good fun. Although I do remember

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,960
like the sheer amount of lines you had to write just to, like, create, like, an eight by eight

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,080
square, you know, an eight by eight pixel character on the screen, and moving it was really,

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,200
really challenging. And, you know, you didn't have, like, clever things like events and

25
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,440
moving in terms of mouse cursors and things back in those days. But anyway, this was not intended

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,880
to be one of those geekier than thou conversations. But, you know, it's been a bit of a

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:48,080
challenge. But yeah, so at school, I always loved science, and I ended up doing a degree in

28
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,640
biochemistry. And just towards the end of that, I started getting really interested in something

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:03,280
called bioinformatics, which is the study of atoms and molecules and other such things with the help

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,120
so we used to download these great big data files off this database in Switzerland, which were like

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,560
the exact structural information for different molecules. And then you used to have a local

32
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,560
program which would actually render that to show you like a typical kind of, you know, ball and

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,120
socket diagram. And you could do things like you can go, okay, well, if I change this amino acid

34
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,280
in that protein chain, it's got different, you know, attraction, and it's got different positive

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,320
and negative attraction values. So how does that change the way that the whole protein folds up

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,320
and structures itself? So stuff like that was quite fun and geeky and interesting. But yeah,

37
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:54,960
didn't really have much luck getting a job in like chemistry or biomedical science type stuff. So I

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,400
decided to go for a job at a book publishers instead, and it was Rocks Press. I don't know

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,960
if you remember those folks, but back in the day doing books about ASP and ASP.net and stuff.

40
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,360
It was those red book covers with the really ugly author faces all over the covers.

41
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,920
But yeah, that was the place I ended up and did a bunch of books about

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,640
web standards and about all sorts of stuff. It was there that I met Bruce Lawson, who has been

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,040
one of my long standing partners in crime in the open standards industry. And we started the

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,800
Glasshouse imprint, which was one of the first publishing imprints dedicated to open standards

45
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:42,880
books. And then around 2003 or so this is Rocks Press went horribly bankrupt, and I ended up

46
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,880
working for these nice folks called A Press over in California. And it was there that I ended up

47
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,640
becoming managing editor of Friends of Ed. I don't know if you remember Friends of Ed at all, but

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:05:01,600
they were. I do, I do. Yeah. Originally did books about Flash and Photoshop, but we kind of turned

49
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,280
it into turn that around and turned it into a an open standards book publisher. So did a whole

50
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,480
bunch of books on HTML and CSS and DOM scripting stuff. We published Jeremy Keefe's first book on

51
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,040
DOM scripting and a number of other great titles. But about that time, I felt it was time to move

52
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,280
past the publishing industry. And my first proper job in web standard stuff was an opera.

53
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,320
And I do miss those days back with folks like Bruce and Patrick Lauker and

54
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,000
Henny Swan and Dan Davis doing open evangelism. It was an interesting time that because

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,800
opera never really had much of a market share, but we seem to have a disproportionately large voice in

56
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,360
terms of doing standard stuff. And then after a good few years there, it was time to go to Mozilla

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,640
and work on MDN, which is where it started to get really interesting, I think. And yeah, at that

58
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,120
point, I spent eight years working on MDN, doing lots of content on lots of different web APIs and

59
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:14,320
CSS stuff. After a while, it felt like time to move on. This is getting really boring, isn't it?

60
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:22,560
And fast forward a couple of years, and yeah, I ended up at the point where I wanted to start

61
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,400
something new again after doing a couple of years at Okta, doing identity and access management

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,440
documentation. And at this point, I've started up my own company called Mills Docs Limited, and

63
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:44,720
I'm now an independent documentation writer specializing in open standards, doing as much of

64
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,600
that good stuff as I can. And funnily enough, one of my first clients is Google, who have got me back

65
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,120
writing stuff on MDN again. So it's kind of a bit of a kind of a weird boomerang situation, but I'm

66
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,160
very happy with where I've ended up, because also it means I get to talk to nice people like yourself

67
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,280
a bit more often. So yeah, it feels like a good place to be right now.

68
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,280
That's amazing. That's a great story. And a lot of that stuff I have no idea about.

69
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,200
That's quite the leap from bioinformatics and protein folding to book publishing.

70
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Did that kind of just like happen? Was it intentional? Was there an interest in that always?

71
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:29,360
So when I was at university, I can remember sitting there messing about on things like

72
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,280
GeoCities and MySpace playing with HTML and CSS stuff. But I never really had it in mind that I'd

73
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,480
do that stuff for a living. It was more a case of when I left university and went, oh crap,

74
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,640
I need to get a job now, the government aren't paying me to sit around in my student flats,

75
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,400
and even flat anymore. I thought, what the hell am I going to do? So I looked around,

76
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,960
I applied for a few jobs doing biochemistry related stuff, and realized actually,

77
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,360
it's really hard to get a job around here because I don't have a PhD. So I went,

78
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,600
ah, what the hell else am I going to do? And then I think by chance, I saw an advert saying,

79
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,840
trainee technical editors wanted to work on books about programming and HTML and stuff.

80
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,000
And I thought, oh, I know what HTML stands for. So I might be in with a shot for that job.

81
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,080
And it was cool, because whereas the kind of science bodies that I tried to get jobs with

82
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,240
in stuff related to my degree were kind of very formal, you know, had to go in there in a suit

83
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,280
and be quizzed by lots of panels of scientists, this was a much more chilled out, relaxing kind

84
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:40,720
of outlook. I can remember when I got my interview at Rock's Press being told, turn up in casual

85
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,400
clothes. And I was thinking, whoa, is that like a trap? Am I going to turn up and they're going to

86
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,840
be like, hey, you're not wearing a suit, screw you, man. And I was like, I'm not wearing a suit,

87
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,920
you're not wearing a suit, screw you, man. But I turned it up. I turned up wearing, you know,

88
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,040
ripped jeans and a Sepultura t-shirt and got on very well with them. And they were like, hey,

89
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,280
this guy seems all right. We'll give him a job. So yeah, it was pretty much partially an accident

90
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,840
and partially just like, hey, this sounds cool. Let's try this out. And it turned out being

91
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:18,240
a really good direction to go in. So that's brilliant. Yeah, it is one of the things I

92
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:27,440
also enjoy about tech is that it is for the most part, I don't know, I fit more with the

93
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,960
people in tech. I think it's what it boils down to. I wouldn't have made it in a corporate like

94
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,240
wearing a suit kind of thing. Like even in school, I constantly got into trouble because I wasn't

95
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
wearing a tie, but I was wearing a jersey. And it's like, you have to wear the two together.

96
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,520
And I was like, that doesn't make any sense. And I'm not going to wear a tie.

97
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,080
So yeah, the fact that I don't have to wear a tie and a suit to do my job,

98
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:58,720
I think is a good thing. But you mentioned that you have now gone the independent route and started

99
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,200
Mills Docks, which by the way, I love the name. And I'm always super excited when I hear people

100
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,440
doing this. It's very hard. It's scary and all these things. But I think the potential for

101
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,000
entrepreneurship and for startups and these kinds of things to create opportunity for others down

102
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,800
the line is what excites me about it. And that is why I'm doing what I'm doing with my company,

103
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,800
why I decided like, I have this company name that kind of started out as a way to be able to keep

104
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,400
working for Mozilla. But then I was like, well, wait a minute, maybe I should try and do something

105
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,160
with this. I've built up so many connections with so many people. I've been privileged to be able

106
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:49,520
to do that through the work I did or still do at Mozilla. And I have this burning passion for

107
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,880
open web, open standards, accessibility, all this stuff, and sharing my knowledge and stuff

108
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,840
with other people. So I was like, can I somehow take all these things and build a company around

109
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:07,520
it? And I've had some failed attempts, but I think it's because I was trying to do, I wasn't doing

110
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,720
what I wanted to do. So what I wanted to do and what I was doing, they were kind of at odds with

111
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:21,760
each other. But I think I found my way finally during the course of this year. But enough about

112
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:30,880
me. I'm curious about what made you decide to take this leap of faith and what is your hopes

113
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:40,640
for Millstocks? So it's something I've wanted to do for at least a decade, but I've always kind of

114
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,880
had the excuses and the fears coming up in the back of my mind. You know, it's like the main fear,

115
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,840
of course, is, am I still going to be able to find work to pay my mortgage, you know,

116
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,920
going to be able to find work to pay my mortgage and feed my family? Or are we going to end up,

117
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,680
you know, painting a colourful cardboard box on the side of the road in three months?

118
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,760
And it's pretty much purely that fear that kept me from doing it for the longest,

119
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,440
longest time. And looking back on it, you know, I keep, I've said to my wife a couple of times,

120
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,440
you know, I wish I'd done this years ago, because it seems great. And she's just like, but you keep

121
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,920
saying that, but you can't say that, you know, because the right time arrives, and it's the right

122
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
time, you can't sort of say, oh, well, the right time would have been 10 years ago, because it

123
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,080
obviously wasn't because you didn't do it. But I suppose, like, on that note, I think the main

124
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,520
thing to try and do is to try and make sure that you've got at least a couple of months of money

125
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,400
built up so that if everything does go wrong, you can still pay the bills and things just for a

126
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,160
little while while you're figuring it out. The other option, which I also know that some people

127
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,480
have done in the past is pretty much, you know, work two jobs until you get your own business

128
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,480
like going enough and buoyant enough to be able to then just jack in your regular day job.

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,960
I remember talking to some folks like Mark Bolton a long time ago about that,

130
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:10,080
and being really fascinated by, you know, the idea of how you can have enough tenacity to survive two

131
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,080
jobs, you know, like working your day job, and then like working your own company through the

132
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,680
evening and into the small hours to try and I think, I think that's a great kind of vision.

133
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,640
And it's, I'm really impressed if anyone that can do that. But I think really, I'm just too old and

134
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,400
knackered to do that now, you know, I'm getting old, I just can't cope with working 16 hours a

135
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,520
day anymore. Although I have done it from time to time in the past when there's been crunch periods,

136
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,000
don't get me wrong, we all have, but it's not a sustainable, sensible way to try and live your

137
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,680
life at any age, really. I think the next thing to think about really is that the best time really

138
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,120
is when you can kind of, again, we have advantages, you know, we have immense privilege in the

139
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,080
opportunities we've had for a whole number of reasons. And, but I think anyone can build up a

140
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,760
number of connections, regardless of what walk of life you come from. You just have to have been

141
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,840
around for a while, had a little bit of luck, met some good people, but really the best way to do

142
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:22,640
that is to go out there, be happy and friendly and helpful and just be positive and kind in as many

143
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,920
situations as you can, because that kind of thing really does get paid back to you in droves.

144
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,880
And then, you know, once you've done enough of that stuff for a few years, you'll then

145
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,120
start to see opportunities, you know, I think that's one thing, regardless of how much crap that

146
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,320
life throws your way, just never stop being kind and empathic and helping others, because

147
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,600
I really think that stuff will come back eventually, even if it doesn't seem like it sometimes.

148
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,360
You know, I sit here saying that, but I'm white and male and incredibly privileged.

149
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,320
But it's not as if I haven't worked hard to get where I am, you know, I've done a ton of work

150
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,920
for a very long time. And I think that stuff has resulted in me eventually being in a situation

151
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:21,280
where I have enough contacts that a couple of really good contracts were brought up through

152
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,800
the contacts I had, that allowed me to think, hell, this stuff will be what I need to last me

153
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,360
at least a year or so, you know, and this is the time that the time is now right to start my own

154
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,160
company. So that's that's kind of how I eventually arrived at that. It wasn't as if it was a great

155
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,000
plan for a long time, but just in a in about maybe a six month period, I kind of went from

156
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,800
going well, I feel like I want to move on from my current job. A couple of jobs that I applied for

157
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,000
didn't really work out for a couple of reasons. And then from that I kind of went well, there's

158
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,920
the combination of that and a couple of opportunities that are looking likely and let's

159
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,280
just take that chance and jump kind of thing. It always feels frightening, but you know,

160
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:12,640
I'd like to stress to anybody listening that once you've done it, provided that you're hard

161
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,480
working, and you've got integrity, and you've got a few contacts, and you've just got that

162
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,880
discipline to really work hard to begin with, and really sort of get all of that stuff built

163
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,400
up that you need to make a good go of it, I think you should succeed. And after a few months,

164
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,320
you'll be sitting there like me thinking, why the heck didn't I do this like years ago?

165
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,240
So it feels good. I mean, it particularly feels good to hardly attend any meetings anymore,

166
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,480
and to be your own boss and to really be able to just decide what you want to work on all the time.

167
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,320
And yeah, I think the other thing for me as well is that, you know, I did a whole bunch of management

168
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,600
in my employed career. But I kind of felt like I wanted to take a bit of a rest from that and

169
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,680
just sort of get back to individual contribution again. I think one of the key issues behind

170
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,240
management is just making sure that you understand the problems that all of your direct reports are

171
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,200
going through and be able to understand what they're doing. And to do that, really, you have

172
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,920
to have a bunch of experience in actually doing the job yourself. But I started to feel like I was

173
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,240
getting a bit too far away from the job itself. And I wanted to get back to that. But yeah,

174
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,440
at the end of the day, I just love discussing and writing great documentation. That's what

175
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,040
I'm here for. And it feels great to have got back to a much purer form of that.

176
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,200
And the other thing that you asked about was future plans. I think what I really want to do

177
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,320
is, you know, I'm working hard for the first year or so just to build up some great connections and

178
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,640
to do some great work. And also, you know, just as importantly, to build up a bit of cash in the

179
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,480
company so that I can start to then chill out a bit after that. But I think my longer term plans are

180
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,000
I want to get to the point where I don't have to work quite as much every week. So

181
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,360
I can hopefully start to spend some time teaching some people, mentoring some people and start to

182
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,720
give back to the community that way. One thing that I've always found a bit sad in the companies

183
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,920
that I've worked for, you know, you get a lot of great people, you get some companies doing some

184
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:20,160
great work, but there rarely seems to be that much time for mentorships and to actually get juniors

185
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,480
on board and skill them up and help with that kind of thing. Companies always seem to want stuff done

186
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,320
really quickly. So they always hire really experienced people and pay them loads of money

187
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,120
to do the work really fast. But it'd be great just to chill out a bit and just take that sort of

188
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,120
more chilled out longer term view of, you know, let's do this a little bit more slowly, but

189
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,400
actually skill up some people into the bargain. That's really what I want to head towards eventually.

190
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:54,720
Yeah, that's great. I love that. So when I get somebody on the podcast, I spend some time like

191
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,600
researching on them as much as I can to find topics that I know they might be interested in

192
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,640
talking about or things that I didn't know and I'd like to learn more about stuff like that.

193
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,440
You made it really easy because you sent out a tweet a while back in response to Bruce Lawson,

194
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:21,440
I think it was. And it's like the question was, what can you talk about with any heads up that

195
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,320
you're going to have to talk? And you posted a couple of topics that you can talk about without

196
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:34,160
being prompted. So I want to dig into some of those topics. The first one I find particularly

197
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,200
interesting because I think people don't really know what technical writing is. And I think there's

198
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,640
more people that would actually find it super interesting and we love doing that. But because

199
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,080
I don't know what it is, they might think that, oh no, these are like people who've gone and done

200
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,600
doctorates and PhDs on how a computer functions. I will never be able to do that.

201
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:07,920
So can you, from your perspective, break down what is technical writing and what does somebody need

202
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:15,760
if they are thinking like, okay, this is starting to sound interesting to me. What is the road

203
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,800
you follow to becoming a technical writer? Oh, that is a really interesting question.

204
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,960
I mean, that could be a very short or a very long answer. I suspect we haven't got time here to make

205
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,720
it a really long answer. So I'll try and get it somewhere in the middle. So I guess my short to

206
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,720
medium length answer would be that I think with technical writing, there's two main parts to it.

207
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,600
One of which is investigation and research. That's one thing that you've got to have an

208
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,880
aptitude for. And the other thing is being able to break down complex subjects and explain them

209
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,760
clearly to people to help them understand them. So that's really the two sides of the story.

210
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,720
So with everything that you need to write some documentation about, you first need to do a bunch

211
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,400
of research. You need to go, okay, for a start, what's the target audience here? What's the target

212
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,040
audience for the technology or the product that I'm about to write something concerning?

213
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Is it a developer? Is it a DevOps person? Is it a designer? Is it a variety of different people?

214
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,200
Is it maybe even someone that's not very technical, someone who has no technical knowledge

215
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,520
and wants to sort of get started in this particular technology or field? There's also other things to

216
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:48,720
consider such as what is the prerequisite knowledge? Is this for complete beginners or is it for

217
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,720
advanced level people who just want to get better at stuff and they already know the basics?

218
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,920
What are the other technologies that you need to already know before you start using this

219
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,080
particular thing that you're writing about? So there's all of that stuff. When you've got that

220
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:10,000
figured out, it's usually a good idea to sit there and put yourself in the mindset of that person

221
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,680
that you're writing this document. Think to yourself, okay, what are the questions they're

222
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,000
going to have about this thing I'm writing about? What is it that they're going to want to know?

223
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,840
At that point, you can start to think about what to write about the actual technology,

224
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,920
and you've got to scope the work carefully, as you do with any task that you're doing,

225
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,120
whether you're a developer or a bricklayer or a plumber or whatever. Think to yourself, okay,

226
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:36,480
so I could write all of this stuff about this technology, but what do I actually need to do

227
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,240
first? As with any complex task, it's a good idea to break it down into different phases to go,

228
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:50,160
okay, first of all, I'm going to write down, I'm going to create just the quick start for this

229
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,880
particular technology, just the one or two articles that help someone get into it in 10 minutes flat.

230
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:03,200
Then after that, I'll start to do further phases to create reference material which explains

231
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,560
everything you could possibly want to do and allow you to look up things or

232
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,680
other advanced tutorials to write. Once you've got the scope of the work, you then need to go

233
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,480
and start investigating exactly what do I need to put into each of these documents that I'm going

234
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,120
to write. Usually, this involves a lot of hard self-reflection where you realize how little you

235
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,440
actually know about this stuff versus what you thought you knew about it. That's one of the main

236
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,920
reckonings to come up against, and you just have to go through it and figure out what you need to

237
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,040
do. I'll give you an example, so today I was attempting to create a load of documentation about

238
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:45,680
some new options to do with the Screen Capture API on MDN, and I sat there and I read through loads of

239
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,800
blog posts to help me just to understand the API in the first place because I'm not hugely familiar

240
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:57,280
about screen capture, and I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with the screen capture

241
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,960
to help me just to understand the API in the first place because I'm not hugely familiar with it.

242
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,920
Then I went through and looked through the Google Chrome source code to try and figure out

243
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,800
exactly which bits of it they implement and exactly which bits they don't, and which classes

244
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:23,040
are all of these different properties and options that I'm wanting to write about? Which classes

245
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,080
are they hanging off? What constructor are they involved with? Where do I need to put this

246
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:34,000
documentation on the site? And then another thing I tend to do at this point is that I write myself

247
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,120
a great big research document just to record all of that information so that I can then look back

248
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,040
on it and go ah that's what I need to write about. Another thing at this point to do which I think

249
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,160
is a really good idea is start off by writing one or two paragraphs about each thing that you're

250
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,640
trying to document just to make sure you understand what it is that you're writing about, because if

251
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,280
you can't explain to yourself in a few words what you're going to be writing about you sure as hell

252
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,240
won't be able to do that for other people. So I think I'm starting to waffle a bit so I think

253
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:11,360
I'll leave that in terms of the research and investigation part, but then onto the actual

254
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,000
writing of the stuff. When you're writing this involves of course a decent amount of aptitude

255
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,800
with language, whichever language it is that you're writing documentation in. You need to be able to

256
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:31,120
explain things really clearly. A general good rule of thumb is that you need to you need to write

257
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:39,040
so that you're trying to explain this to like you know maybe like a high school kid or something

258
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,760
like that. You know there's going to be quite a lot of complex terminology that you're going to

259
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,760
need to use, but you should make sure that you only use the term the complex terminology that

260
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,880
you have to use. Make sure you explain to it, explain the stuff you're talking about in as

261
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,680
clear language as you possibly can. Don't use jargon unless you absolutely have to.

262
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,960
So there's the language part of it. I think also there's the style part of it. You know you need

263
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,960
to make sure that the stuff is grammatically correct in terms of the language you're writing,

264
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,040
but you also need to add some style and some fun into it to make it so that not only can it be

265
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,560
understood, but it also makes the technology exciting to learn and interesting. It makes

266
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,280
people want to actually read the stuff you're writing about. I mean that comes with practice

267
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:34,400
and comes with quite you know a few years of building it up. But yeah I think I'm going to

268
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
stop there of the writing as well because I mean I really could talk for hours about this stuff,

269
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:46,960
but yeah really investigation and writing. Notice that I haven't mentioned programming ability or

270
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,160
web development ability or anything like that. I think really that stuff is all incidental to

271
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,840
the stuff that you're going to be documenting. So obviously it really really helps and you do kind

272
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,640
of need to be able to understand the technologies that you're writing about. But in a way that's

273
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,160
kind of like a background detail I think to just the first two which are really the more important

274
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:18,560
focus. So you'll be able to pick up the technologies gradually as you go along,

275
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,520
but your focus should really be the sort of the passion to investigate

276
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,800
and explain and to teach the stuff that you want to write about.

277
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:38,160
I hope that answered the question. Yeah no it totally did. Do you think it can be a good

278
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:46,400
way to learn? Like if you, not pretend, but if you play the role of a technical writer in your own

279
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:54,720
learning journey and so as you learn stuff you write about it in a way that maybe helps you

280
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:03,600
understand it better yourself? Totally. I think that's another great use of

281
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,640
blogging or tweeting as it's kind of become, although hey maybe not for much longer.

282
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:19,520
But yeah you know I think it totally helps. Like I've had, I've talked to loads of people

283
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,200
about this, like I remember talking to Estelle about this who now works for OpenWebDocs documenting

284
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,640
stuff on MDN and she was kind of saying that you know before we contracted her originally to work

285
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,560
on MDN she was saying hell this is great you know I really enjoy playing with technology,

286
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,640
I really enjoy writing about it on my blog and explaining it to other people so that they can

287
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,520
use it and it sounds like now you're going to basically pay me for something that I really

288
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,040
enjoy doing anyway and it's kind of like well that's totally cool to be able to get in roads

289
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,520
but I mean the salient point there is that I think that's basically what her and a lot of other

290
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,280
people have done you know it's like well I want to understand this technology so rather than just

291
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,000
writing a bunch of code examples and messing about with code which is, let's face it that's

292
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,520
also a great way to learn you know don't just stop there, create a code example but then also

293
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,400
explain how that works in a blog post and it helps you understand it even better so yeah I would

294
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:24,880
absolutely agree with that. Cool yeah I agree I think it's helped me differently and it still does

295
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:32,640
if I learn something new I often find it good to after the fact kind of try and write what I learned

296
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,280
or how I got to the answer of like this is the problem I faced this is how I got there

297
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,600
and then fill in the gap. Not only now do I have an artifact that I can look back at

298
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,720
but I have kind of proved to myself that I do understand it actually.

299
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,240
I think yeah absolutely I think one problem that does tend to come up from time to time is

300
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,360
the kind of scoping of the writing and the examples so you know you can if you want to

301
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:13,680
document a single property then you can do that and the code example might just be like a single

302
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,880
line of JavaScript but then you've got to think about well actually does that help me use this

303
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,360
in the real world what context do I need to use that in to actually make real use of it in a real

304
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,480
application and what scaffolding code has to sit behind it before that's actually effective and

305
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,920
useful and then you've got to kind of play with the scoping and figure out okay you know that's

306
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,760
just one line of code but to actually make it useful it's got to sit inside this giant

307
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,880
application that does all of this other stuff in the background but in terms of teaching someone

308
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,120
how to use these individual properties you can't show them like an entire application's worth of

309
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,520
code on every page you've got to kind of structure the examples so that you're making each individual

310
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:06,720
piece understandable while still kind of providing that useful real world context in how you're going

311
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,760
to use it so that's a bit of a balance that you need to achieve as you as you go through technical

312
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,760
writing and it's something that you just learn to do as you go forward you know there's

313
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,880
there's one one danger that I see people do a lot in technical writing is too many kitchen sink

314
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,240
examples so too many examples that show you how to do everything when actually you're just trying

315
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,160
to show someone how to how to use one single property you know the the best code examples

316
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:40,480
for technical writing just show how to do one thing well but they also show how show it how to

317
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:51,360
do it in a way that's transferable into the real world yeah yeah I I think writing good examples

318
00:31:51,360 --> 00:32:00,560
is really a art form because I oftentimes the the examples you see people use aren't really

319
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,360
connected to any real world use case and so it's almost like you're learning something in the

320
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,640
abstract and you're so now you kind of understand on a technical level better what this thing is

321
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,240
but you still find it a little hard to understand how do I use this to solve an actual problem so

322
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:27,520
I think being able to connect those two things is really important yep no absolutely I think

323
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,760
the second biggest mistake I always see in code examples for technical writing is when people write

324
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,000
a code snippets that's really really clever but really hard to understand you know so it's like

325
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,960
fair enough you're a fantastic programmer this thing that I wrote in 10 lines you've

326
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,760
shown me how to do in two lines but actually my thing is a lot easier for people to understand

327
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:59,760
what's actually happening you know it's like you know when I when I return the value of that

328
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,640
property what object does that return and then I need to use a method that's hang that's hanging

329
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,360
off of that particular object and you know usually and you get some sort of chain like

330
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,680
that and you go well actually even though you could do that with one line it's often helpful

331
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,800
to sort of separate that out into the individual steps across three or four lines just so that

332
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,720
people can actually grok the chain of the chain of events that's a terrible term which will

333
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,840
be completely misconstrued the the different happenings that's going from start to finish

334
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,320
at that one line because otherwise it's just too difficult to get it if you've only seen that for

335
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:47,280
the first time yeah I completely agree so um I think well I don't think I know because I've

336
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:54,480
heard this many times and experience with myself that documentation is often the what makes the

337
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,640
difference between a successful open source project and a failure and you've been involved

338
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,120
in quite a number of open source projects that has really good documentation for example web

339
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,880
docs mdn web docs what has been some of the takeaways some of the stuff that you've learned

340
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,840
that you think is key to running a successful documentation project be it for an open source

341
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,720
project or closed source doesn't really matter but more of a focus may be on the open source side

342
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:31,840
okay um I think one of the number one important things is having really really clear processing

343
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:43,040
guidelines because if you don't have clear guidelines then you just end up with really

344
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:50,480
really bad inconsistency everywhere and it's okay if you've only got 10 pages but when you build

345
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,480
it up to a behemoth of a sort of size of mdn you then realize that you've got so many documents

346
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,040
so much documentation debt sat there that it's going to be nearly impossible to fix it all

347
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,680
and then it requires some passionate dedicated people to spend hundreds of hours fixing stuff up

348
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,840
just to get things not even particularly being that much better but just being consistent

349
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:21,520
but then again you know it's not so it's not so obvious what the improvement is when you just

350
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,160
fix a small number of those kind of paper kit paper cut inconsistency fixes but then when you

351
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,720
start to look at the whole project from a much higher level you then realize actually this is

352
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,480
just improving the quality and the polish of this thing so much but really it starts to become the

353
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:46,320
difference between the project living and dying um so in terms of guidelines this can be things

354
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,920
like you know exactly how do we take an image what size does the image need to be does it need to be

355
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,320
centered on the page or left aligned do i need to make sure that i capture it at a high enough

356
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,520
resolution so it doesn't start to look really pixely and crappy on high-res screen devices

357
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,920
all of these kind of things well what what kind of language guidelines do we use do we

358
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,120
do we have sentence case capitalization on headings you know all of this kind of stuff

359
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,960
it's just good to keep that stuff in mind and make sure you try and apply it

360
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,560
as consistently as possible now i also mentioned process so particularly in terms of things like

361
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,200
open source projects process is things like okay if i've submitted submitted a pull request

362
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,920
who's responsible for reviewing that how long can i expect to wait for a review

363
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,840
what am i expected to do to make it as easy as possible for other people to review

364
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:54,640
um these kind of things are also very important you know and not only is it good to have process

365
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:02,480
and guidelines to make the work better itself and the flow of work better but it's also great for

366
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,560
covering covering your own back as well if somebody starts to complain and say hey well

367
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,360
that thing's like that you can just you can just point to the process doc and say hey that's

368
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,200
because it's outlined in the process doc or it's outlined in these guidelines rather than

369
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,960
rather than just kind of making stuff up on the fly every time you get asked that question which

370
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,040
can lead to bad feeling when people see that you're making inconsistent decisions or

371
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,840
doing things that look like you're favoring one contributor over another contributor

372
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,240
so i'd say all of that stuff is really really important

373
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,440
it processes also when you start to get something where you get the number of

374
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,400
contributions that you do on mdn web docs and you know speaking to you as the community manager

375
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,560
of mdn web docs you know only too well just how much work it is to do that and try and manage

376
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,440
the community and manage who's doing what issue who's fixing what problem um you know process is

377
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,120
also hugely important for just trying to make sense of an enormous great big volume of issues

378
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:10,000
and pull requests flying at you all the time um so i think those are the two main things really

379
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,480
um in terms of other things that are important to think about for open source projects um i think

380
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,680
also part of the process and really this is coming into governance you need things like code of

381
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,840
conduct to make sure that people are treated as fairly as possible and anybody that comes

382
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:38,880
into the community and is a bad apple and starts being unconstructive or or you know god forbid

383
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:48,160
abusive um is dealt with using a firm but fair process to make sure that you can keep positive

384
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,720
feeling up um i think also this comes back to mentorship as well you know um as well as making

385
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,240
sure that everything's fair for people you also need to make sure that there's good beginners

386
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,520
documentation to help people get started but then also people to help mentor people and skill them

387
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,560
up so but they can start doing things more autonomously i think the biggest fear with

388
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,520
open source projects is you sit there and you go okay there's three or four of us that are

389
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,440
really autonomous and are getting loads of stuff done but if we stop and start spending some time

390
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,120
mentoring people instead that's going to take up all of our time so how on earth is all of the work

391
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,440
going to get done it's just going to grind to a hole but you need to have a balance don't you

392
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,520
need to carry on doing the good stuff but you also need to spend maybe a little bit of time skilling

393
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,480
people up so that you can then start to see the benefits of that later and then of course as

394
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,920
people start to move on from that project you need to make sure that you've still got people

395
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,560
to carry on the good work there and it doesn't just grind to a hole

396
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,840
yeah so yeah i think that's good advice yeah i think that's the main stuff that i've learned from

397
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:00,640
open source stuff i think a lot of those are all very good points a lot of big more enterprisey

398
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,360
companies could really benefit from those kind of open source project philosophies i've seen too many

399
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,160
kind of companies which are doing their documentation for their project on github

400
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,680
but mainly just because you know it's convenient to use something like a static site generator

401
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:29,120
type setup to publish your documentation but then failing to take advantages of

402
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,000
all of the kind of good open source magic that you could get by just opening up that documentation

403
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
and encouraging outside contributions you know if you've got your stuff on github but you're

404
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,600
not allowing external contributions then hell what you're doing you know it's just it doesn't

405
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,800
make any sense not to really yeah that's that's very true do you have any like examples of

406
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,040
either companies or open source projects that do this really well

407
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:15,040
well aside from the obvious you know mdn which is contributed to by loads of companies

408
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:24,880
um i'm just trying to think um i'm trying to think of a good example of like a company which is

409
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:35,520
you know pretty much a closed source product but it also takes lots and lots of contributions from

410
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,640
the open source community in terms of its documentation

411
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,360
um amazon from what i can tell seem to be quite good at doing that in terms of aws documentation

412
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,800
i've got a few friends there and they seem to have quite an active kind of

413
00:41:52,800 --> 00:42:00,480
um contributions from the community um i'm not so sure if it's worth really mentioning

414
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,960
google and all of the community contributions they get to their docs because i mean that's like an

415
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,160
open source project anyway you know if you look at chrome it was an open source project

416
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:17,760
yeah yeah i'm drawing a bit of a blank i'm afraid but i'll have to think about other good examples

417
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,160
have you looked at how getup does their getup docs project because that's been open source now

418
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,400
since mid last year i think oh no i've not really looked at that so much

419
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,320
cool yeah it'd be interesting to know your thoughts on that one um because we have somebody that we

420
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:42,960
mutually know that works on that project now uh peter benkson he works at getup on the getup docs

421
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,800
project so um you know he's taken a lot of the learnings from mdn there and he's done a lot of

422
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,600
um you know he's taken a lot of the learnings from mdn there but he's also said that

423
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,920
there's also some stuff they do that web docs don't and um there's actually a quite a lot of

424
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:10,480
uh cross-pollination opening at the moment between uh web docs and getup um to learn from each other

425
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,200
especially now that their docs project is also open source and they are they're starting to

426
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,560
they're starting to experience some of the problems that we've already had and sort of kind of solved

427
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:27,760
or are more um used to or we're almost at a point where we are kind of solving it uh but they know

428
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,840
the technology we use much better than what we do like getup itself so you know they can help us

429
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,600
again from that perspective so it's quite interesting um how that that kind of relationship

430
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:46,720
is building up and being mutually beneficial yeah that's that's absolutely great like i'd

431
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,800
completely forgotten that peter had gone over to github but yeah i do remember that now i will have

432
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,600
to look into it yeah yeah interesting to know what you think so um you kind of touched on this when

433
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:04,240
you mentioned stuff like code of conducts and things like this but um a slightly harder topic

434
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,960
i guess um challenges facing the tech industry like you've been in tech industry quite for quite

435
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,680
some time the tech industry has changed but also stayed the same in many many respects you've worked

436
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:23,520
at everything from like big open source kind of companies like mozilla but also at octa now recently

437
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:32,640
um what have you found in your career so far to be like challenges that we just haven't dealt with

438
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,360
with properly yet i mean one of the things that i find fascinating is to learn that of all

439
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:46,960
contributions made to open source only 13 percent is women and only 17 from africa it seems

440
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:54,960
disproportionate and i wonder what your thoughts are on on those things it's really hard isn't it

441
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:04,480
you know the whole um equal opportunities and dni stuff is something that i do care about a great

442
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:11,120
deal and i would love to be able to help to fix this problem um but i don't think it's something

443
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:20,480
that can be very easily fixed um you know we have we have a society that's largely set up so that

444
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:28,720
that it advantages men and white people you know let's just you know and that's me speaking as a

445
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,720
white male i'm i'm painfully aware of that but then again at the same time i'm not because i think if

446
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:43,520
you don't suffer from prejudices that come from not being white and male you you don't notice them

447
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,280
and you can't even really imagine what effect that has um one thing that i would love to do

448
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:57,840
um going back to the idea of mentorship is deliberately give mentorship opportunities to

449
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:06,320
non-white non-males um just to basically try and give a bit back and to help with this whole issue

450
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,120
because you know that the number of times i've heard people complain about oh well you know

451
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,240
it's ridiculous like the amount of effort that's expended expanded on you know trying to give

452
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:22,000
trying to give opportunities for like you know non-whites and non-males haven't they had enough

453
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,080
and it's like yeah but actually as white males we get those advantages every day of our lives

454
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,600
by default as soon as we wake up without even trying and that's why we can never stop thinking

455
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,640
about this stuff and that's why you know in my own small way i want to do as much as i as much

456
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,880
as i can as i can about this and really i don't think this is a subject i can say too much more

457
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,800
about because i'm painfully aware that as a white male i don't understand it enough yet

458
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,560
and i don't think i'll ever understand it perhaps enough but i can just understand it as much as i

459
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:03,360
can being in the position that i am yeah so yeah you know yeah i don't even know if it's

460
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,920
i don't even know if it's got particularly that much better in the 20 plus years i've

461
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,280
been in the tech industry i certainly think it's got a bit better but least companies kind of

462
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:22,480
notice it now but then again i mean i was quite impressed with octa when i worked there but it

463
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:30,000
seemed octa seemed to be a company that recognize diversity and inclusion challenges but actually

464
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,880
really try and do something about it rather than just kind of paying lip service to it you know

465
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,800
having having a lame-ass little black lives matter sticker in the corner of your

466
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,800
site and then doing absolutely nothing about it apart from that you might as well please

467
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,800
just don't bother it's just pathetic but yeah octa did do a lot more than your average company

468
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:58,240
in terms of having like focus groups for women lgbt people of color inside the company and really

469
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:05,760
helping them to get advantages and get opportunities and then they have the whole

470
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,160
octa for good site as well which is their donations in philanthropy type movement which i was quite

471
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:18,640
impressed impressed by as well so yeah they definitely did more than the default but i'd

472
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:24,640
like the default just to be more i think that's yeah yeah something that's quite a painful truth

473
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,920
really yeah no for sure no i agree i i do think there's there's a lot of talk but not a lot of

474
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,480
action and this is generally a problem that i have with most of these kinds of things and it

475
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,720
plays into politics we won't go there but um it's always a lot of talk but when it comes down to

476
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,800
doing doing something constructive about it then you know it just goes quiet it's like oh okay

477
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,560
cool so we just like talking about it but we don't actually want to do anything about it

478
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:01,760
but um yeah no i i mean i've spoken to a couple of folks um who've been directly affected by

479
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,360
these kinds of things and some of these stories are just terrific it's like you can't believe that

480
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,600
this actually happens like here's a person sitting in front of you telling you that this has happened

481
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,760
to me but you still just can't can't wrap your head around the fact that stuff like this happens

482
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:22,400
to people like where people are um sexualized and stuff like that just openly in an office setting

483
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:30,320
and you're like i don't i don't understand how does this happen uh so yeah it is something that

484
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:36,880
i'm also um like uh it i don't know it plays the same kind of role to me as accessibility

485
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,640
um the accessibility of the products we build but also how accessible we make it to actually

486
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:51,760
enter the industry itself and then um how accessible we make it to get employed um i think

487
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:00,240
that in itself is a struggle and in africa um trying to build your own business is really

488
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,320
really hard because i i listened to a talk uh interview with a woman from africa she's from

489
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,880
legos but she so she built a business in africa and then she built a business in the united

490
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,440
states and she was talking about the the difference between her experience of these two scenarios and

491
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,880
what it boils down to is the system in the u.s for all the problems the united states have

492
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:31,120
the system is set up for you to succeed whereas in africa the system is set up to see you fail

493
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:41,040
and that is a hard truth to acknowledge me being from africa myself i can um corroborate her

494
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,920
experience you're definitely you're fighting constant bureaucracy and red tape to get the most

495
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:55,120
simplest things done like i'm sitting here speaking to you um but i'm actually connected to a big

496
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,240
battery on the left because our power is currently out and it's going to remain out for the next 30

497
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,520
minutes going to be out for about two hours and then in four hours from now it's going to happen

498
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,920
again because our power grid is just unmaintained and the company running it is completely corrupt

499
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:16,640
and so you know these are the things you face so you have to luckily i'm in a position where i can

500
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,320
go out and buy that expensive battery to allow me to be able to do this while it's pitch dark around

501
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,800
me um but not everybody is um a lot of people in this country are losing their jobs having to

502
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,840
close their companies simply because the system is set up for them to fail um and so yeah that

503
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:42,320
that's a very hard thing so for me from my part that is why stuff like accessibility is so important

504
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:48,400
to me because i know how hard it can be to do the most simplest thing and if i can do something to

505
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:55,440
make it a little easier for you to do get something done then by all means i think it's my responsibility

506
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:07,200
to do that absolutely absolutely i think um accessibility is you know just from a more

507
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,280
technical perspective is also another thing that's a major issue in the industry you know i think

508
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:19,840
this does have quite a lot of similarities to draw across like another thing i've noticed is

509
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:29,680
just that it seemed to get better for a while um you know with all of the action that um

510
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:37,360
accessibility advocates did through teaching even basic stuff like just writing proper semantic html

511
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:44,240
and actually using a freaking button when you mean to use a button and not a stupid div style to

512
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,800
look like a button how many times do we have to say it you know bang head against brick wall

513
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,720
um but it kind of seems to have got slightly worse again of late and i think this is because

514
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,360
the new generation coming into the industry a lot of them tend to do it through

515
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,000
less organically just kind of like right you know there's i'm not saying this is a terrible

516
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,560
thing it's great to give people opportunities to work but the number of college courses and

517
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:17,280
code boot camps and things that are just like well to get a job you just need to learn react

518
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,080
because that's the most popular library right now so run you through this quick course to teach you

519
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,400
how to build a react app boom you're gone go and get a job and you're like well that's great but

520
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,200
what about all of the sort of html css and javascript knowledge that underpins that

521
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,360
that you really ought to need to know to build a truly accessible effective application i mean

522
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:44,240
one kind of one anecdote that i can that springs to mind is i i was

523
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,400
asked by a friend of mine to come in and speak at his company about accessibility basics

524
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,880
um to all of his teams and there was quite a few people in his teams that were like fairly young

525
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:03,760
fairly new coders that were building a bunch of react apps and i thought to myself is it really

526
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,120
useful for me to just walk into here and just give like a 25 minute talk about all of this real basic

527
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:19,120
nuts and bolts accessibility stuff surely in 2021 but people were absolutely amazed and astounded

528
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,200
by it and we're just like what you mean it's actually important to use html elements other

529
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:29,120
than div what if something's inaccessible it isn't always the designer's fault it's actually

530
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,600
down to the code as well i was just i couldn't believe like this the sheer lack of knowledge

531
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:41,440
of this whole company about accessibility and yeah it's just weird to me i suppose again you

532
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,960
you live inside certain bubbles don't you so things aren't always like that everywhere but at

533
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,280
the same time i was quite shocked just by how little there was in terms of accessibility

534
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,040
knowledge there so i think that's another thing that we need to kind of ramp up again

535
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:05,520
and yeah so i agree i agreed i just last night watched a video where a person was talking about

536
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:12,160
using vue js and he was talking about okay we're going to create this list of products

537
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:19,360
and then i was like okay cool and then it's like a list of nested divs and i was like you

538
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:27,760
you use the word list just now html has lists you know it has different kinds of lists even i think

539
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,520
we should make this list of products with an ordered list maybe maybe that makes sense and

540
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:39,680
it helps people with accessibility to know this is a list of five items that's useful

541
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:46,560
useful information for them yeah so no i agree i agree i think it has it has slipped

542
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:54,400
out but i do see people talking about it but again i think it's again the thing where we need

543
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:05,680
more than just talk we need examples out there we need courses that teach a library like react

544
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:14,240
like view like swell like whatever is popular but made by people who care and so who use the proper

545
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,240
semantic structure when they show so they're not just like i'm going to show it to make a

546
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,120
view app but i'm going to show it to make a view app using the power of the open web i'm going to

547
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:29,520
show you how to use the proper html the proper css and think about stuff like color contrast and

548
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,760
the order of your document and what the outline of your document looks like and all of these good

549
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,200
things and by doing that show you that hey guess what more often than not your application is going

550
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:47,120
to be more performant because you're not going to reinvent the wheel don't build a select drop down

551
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:52,240
in react use the one the browser gives you i know it's not super pretty but you can style it

552
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,840
to some extent and at least it's accessible to a much much bigger audience and you're going to

553
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:03,920
have a lot less of a headache trying to maintain your own little select drop down because you're

554
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,840
now having to reinvent things that the browser has already implemented years ago

555
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:15,200
yep amen to that brother it's um it's a really difficult one though like i've i've done several

556
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:21,600
talks at universities where i've just had some person stand up in the back and utter some

557
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:29,120
immortal words like why not just use native apps for this because this is a pain in the ass and

558
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:36,560
i'm just like right well you can do that if you want to but the web has so many ways to do it

559
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:43,760
so the web has so many advantages so much easier in terms of distribution so much easier in terms

560
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,680
of not having to reinstall the damn thing every five minutes whenever there's an update

561
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:57,040
so much less in terms of weight of um files to get down the pipe to the users there's so many

562
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:04,080
reasons why the web is a great thing um you know depending on which you what use case it might not

563
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,880
be the best but you know it's good for so many use cases and it's getting better and better so

564
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:17,840
yeah um it does it it winds me up the number of courses you see that just teach you how to do

565
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,480
great applications but with terrible semantics and no thought at all to that side of things

566
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:30,400
but you know it's it's kind of it's turning web development into an a sort of very

567
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,840
it's almost bringing it back towards being a computer science discipline where whereas really

568
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,440
it isn't that it's so much more than that and that's why i find the web more interesting than

569
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:47,920
something like you know developing c++ apps because it's like well you've got this mixture of coding

570
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:54,640
and design and psychology and all sorts of different things that you have to bring into

571
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:59,120
this big melting pot of skills to produce something that's great for your users and it just makes

572
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:06,320
just makes life more interesting yeah for sure i mean that is that's the one reason why

573
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:13,600
moving from being a musician to being a web developer was not as painful because i didn't

574
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:21,040
feel i left so that much on the table um i still have a way to express myself um in creative ways

575
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:28,960
in creative ways um with the web because it is this amalgamation of many different things it's

576
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:35,040
you know it's not it's not just a science it's an art as well absolutely

577
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:45,440
so i have two questions remaining and um the one is light-hearted and the other one is really also

578
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:54,400
but it's also a little philosophical here we go i got it right um so first one um tough one but

579
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:00,960
um what is your top three artists and favorite album and maybe it doesn't have to be all time

580
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:07,760
maybe it can be in the last two years or maybe it is all time there that's a really hard question

581
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,920
it's one of those questions that every time i get asked it i come up with a completely different

582
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,960
answer because i listen to so much music i'm completely and utterly obsessed with music

583
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:24,320
in a really quite some people would say unnatural way my wife certainly seems to think so um although

584
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:29,120
i'm getting one of my daughters to be similarly obsessed with music which i'm quite proud of

585
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:36,320
um so for those of you listening that don't know me i'm completely obsessed by horrible noisy music

586
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:42,720
so heavy metal hardcore punk um but i also like a whole bunch of other stuff i'm pretty much into

587
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:49,840
anything that has a bit of soul and a bit of passion and isn't just soulless manufactured

588
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:58,960
disposable chart crap um and what have i what have i been listening to recently um i'm just trying

589
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:07,280
to think so my my favorite horrible noisy band currently is a us band called full of hell who

590
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:15,600
play really horrible kind of punk grindcore death metal type stuff interesting set of imagery and

591
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:22,880
artwork um some of their lyrical content seems to be quite philosophical and interesting it's not

592
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,240
just that kind of metal stereotype of gore and guts and horror movie type stuff you know which

593
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,800
is not the kind of thing that i'm really that into anyway but yeah i'd certainly recommend full of

594
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:42,480
hell um one of my all-time favorite bands is uh converge again us based kind of another band that

595
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:50,640
sort of straddles the line between punk and metal um they started off by uh playing what i think

596
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:56,720
they themselves described as slayer core which was really punk but with slayer riffs um interesting

597
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,840
and they progressed into something a lot more interesting from there so yes converge are very

598
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:07,280
good i i saw them recently at the damnation festival in the uk along with full of hell as

599
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:13,200
well um but yeah converge played the whole of their classic album jane doe which is really

600
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:22,320
really really good um so yeah that's great um what else in terms of uh less metal stuff um

601
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:30,640
um i quite like a lot of dance music um but again not kind of chatty commercial dance music i quite

602
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:38,640
like breakbeat and glitch and that kind of stuff so i really like afex twin so great artist from

603
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:45,600
the uk that's been doing weird glitchy stuff for a long long time um also really like square pusher

604
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:52,080
which is also in the same kind of vein um and there's a there's a fairly famous uk band called

605
01:02:52,080 --> 01:03:00,240
orbital who do lots of really really great dance stuff um in a way i sometimes find dance music

606
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,040
easier to code to than really noisy metal stuff you know something that's just like a

607
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,160
a solid beat and a bit of an ambience in the background that you can really get into

608
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:17,040
um another one of my favorite bands another one of my favorite bands is the osric tentacles who

609
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:22,320
are another uk band that play kind of like a mixture of dance music and prog rock and

610
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:28,160
kind of weird kind of ethnic instruments and things they're really cool they're quite a

611
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:34,160
special band for me because i actually met my wife as an osric tentacles gig um and i'm going

612
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,120
to go and see them this weekend play in manchester uh along with another one of my favorite bands who

613
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:46,320
are gong i don't know if you've heard of gong g-o-n-g but they're a uh no they were originally like an

614
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:53,200
english slash french band that started in the late 60s and they sort of invented ambient music

615
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:02,160
before it was really a thing um so yeah they play another sort of strange mix of excuse me a mix

616
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:08,480
of kind of ambient and prog and quite a lot of silly whale noises and flutes and saxophones as

617
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:15,920
well so i'd suggest them and then again this list could go on forever but probably my favorite band

618
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,680
of all time at least my favorite band of all time this week is another uk band called the cardiax

619
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:29,680
who play a mix of kind of a mix of prog and punk so a lot of their stuff sounds a bit aggro-y and

620
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:36,000
punk but they're also really really really impressively technical musicians who play really

621
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,000
complex time structures and things but it sounds really quite punk they're not really around so

622
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,800
much anymore sadly sadly their frontman and main creative force tim smith died a couple of years

623
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:57,680
ago after battling a long-standing illness but yeah their music certainly lives on it's a it's

624
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,800
another one of those bands that kind of no one's ever heard of them and they certainly didn't have

625
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:08,160
any great commercial success but whenever they used to play a gig they could fill out like a

626
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:12,880
few thousand person arena you know they were like you know a massive massively popular band but

627
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:19,200
really underground at the same time so yeah that's a little bit of a uh a little bit of a snapshot

628
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,000
into what i've been listening to recently what about yourself man couple of things i'm going

629
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:32,240
to check out yeah i've been getting into ginger a lot like not ginger like j i n j e r um the

630
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:39,280
musicianship in that band is just unbelievable like the drummer the guitarists the bassist is

631
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,200
self the stuff he does is mind-blowing and then the lead vocalist she is something else she goes

632
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:57,120
from high to growls that you can't imagine um is possible um i've really been digging i've been

633
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,520
digging them quite a lot and then i learned they're from ukraine as well and so i've been

634
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:07,840
following them throughout the war and i'm thankful that they are all okay and safe and all that kind

635
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,680
of stuff but they've been sharing some stuff on their youtube channel so i've i've really

636
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,640
gotten into them i have to say and there's like another band that's kind of similar called spirit

637
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:24,800
box it's also a female um lead that also goes from melodic to full-on growl and again the

638
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:32,960
musicianship is just amazing um and some uh instrumental stuff like um animals as leaders

639
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,920
some of these people that play these eight string oh yeah electric guitars it's just like mother

640
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:45,280
it's so impressive and yeah yeah so a bunch of like stuff like that i've been getting really into but

641
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,040
then i've been getting back into some old good old things like in tombs blander stein album

642
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:57,440
um and some of the old sepultura and stuff like that just the rhythmic stuff and that just gets

643
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:04,240
me every time i'm a sucker for a good rhythm oh big time yeah no that's absolutely fantastic

644
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:10,000
now i mean i i've got uh sepultura's beneath the remains album on vinyl i put that on the other

645
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,240
day like sometimes i haven't listened to it for a while but it's a it's a super super brilliant

646
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,800
you know anybody that likes thrash it's just a brilliant album it's really more kind of thrash

647
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:24,480
death but it's it's it's it's absolutely superb um if you're it sounds like you're getting quite

648
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,360
into a bunch of kind of you know interesting female-fronted metal bands and i i also really

649
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:33,360
like ginger i think they're really really impressive really really good stuff but

650
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:39,280
there's a there's a uk band called rolo tamasi who are also like a a metal band

651
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:46,000
but with a female vocalist and she also does like really good melodic singy stuff as well as

652
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,040
growling uh they're really great they they also go into a lot of really weird disturbingly strange

653
01:07:53,040 --> 01:08:00,400
kind of sort of techie screamo prog crazy stuff yeah they're they're they're really really great

654
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:07,760
yeah i'll definitely check them out so in closing what are your hopes for the future

655
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:15,120
and now from two perspectives one for tech and then on a more philosophical perspective

656
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:24,880
for the world crikey that is a big question um i think i could probably sum it up in four

657
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:31,840
in in six words um better climate less war less fascism

658
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,080
you know we could we could get into that a bit more i'm a i'm i'm very much

659
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:44,480
quite seriously committed to environmentalism so my my wife and i have done quite a bit of activism

660
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:54,320
with various groups um not just stop oil but we did do a bunch of stuff with extinction rebellion

661
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:58,400
we've been to quite a lot of protests and done quite a lot of activism activity with them

662
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,160
for me that's the key to everything really is the whole environmental

663
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,280
catastrophe that the world is facing because you know if we don't have a planet to live on anymore

664
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:15,920
everything else we could possibly discuss is just completely and utterly null and void there's not

665
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:23,360
even really it's not really worth talking about um yeah of course one big issue with that i you

666
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:30,160
know i can say that but at the same time another problem that you tend to get is that a lot of

667
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,480
the issues affecting tackling the climate catastrophe so climate change denial all of

668
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:46,400
that kind of stuff tends to be um tends to be connected to uh fascism as well unfortunately

669
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,760
there's a lot of fascist politicians out there that really really don't care about environmental

670
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:58,480
issues they think it's all a hoax they think it's all a load of rubbish made up by woke lefties like

671
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:04,880
me to try and steal a piece of their pie um but really that just goes into the whole selfish

672
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:11,920
outlook that those folks unfortunately often tend to harbor um yeah so yeah uh that's that's one

673
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:21,200
great big hairy deal and of course that also tends to create injustice and it tends to create um

674
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,920
people getting at loggerheads of each other which of course somewhere further down the line leads

675
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:34,000
to war so really these things are all interconnected um but yeah i'm just really really hoping that we

676
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,760
can get a bunch more people thinking about doing things to help the climate catastrophe you know

677
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:48,240
it seems clear to me that the governments of this world again like we talked like something

678
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:52,320
similar to what we mentioned earlier they like to talk a lot about this but they don't seem to

679
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:59,440
really like to do very much about it um yeah yeah so i think what we need is for everybody to start

680
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:05,680
uh helping out with the environmental catastrophe just by doing small things and helping out doing

681
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:11,280
anything they can yeah i would agree and i think one of the key things is i i heard about this

682
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:16,960
thing that they've they've learned and i think it's in taiwan where they've done some research and

683
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,440
so to drown out negativity for each one negative you have to have 10 positive so i think

684
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:33,600
i think we need to as a as a species as the human race we need to drown out this because i do think

685
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:40,160
it's a vocal minority and i've been in so many circumstances where you think that oh so many

686
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:45,600
people are against this thing or for this other thing but then when you really dig into it you

687
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:52,560
find out no it's actually a very vocal minority and if all the rest of the people stop standing

688
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:58,960
by and just looking at it and start speaking up just it we can drown them out very quickly

689
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:05,680
and i think a lot of people are not really aware of the fact that this is no small thing it's

690
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,880
nothing else is important if we don't have a place to live

691
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:16,320
essentially so this this should be like the way the people that that everybody in the world came

692
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:25,680
together to battle covid we need that for climate change climate crisis yep absolutely agree man

693
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,360
well thanks so much chris this was wonderful um i was looking forward to this conversation i'm
