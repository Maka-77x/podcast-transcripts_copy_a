Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:09.840
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.040
Hey Chris, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:14.240 --> 00:17.200
Hey man, thanks for having me. It's good to be on here.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.160
Yeah, thanks. I know you a long time. We knew of each other, I think, for a very long time,

00:26.160 --> 00:32.960
and then we finally met, I think, when you started at Mozilla. Was that it?

00:34.000 --> 00:39.920
I think so. It was 2013, although I seem to remember that we were talking about web

00:39.920 --> 00:45.280
standards and JavaScript and stuff way back when I worked at Opera, because if you recall,

00:45.280 --> 00:53.280
when we did the learning area on MDN, that was pretty much the kind of the next step

00:53.280 --> 00:59.600
from my original educational project, which was the open the web standards curriculum at Opera,

00:59.600 --> 01:05.520
and I got you to write some content for that back in about 2008 or 2009 or something. So,

01:05.520 --> 01:14.640
you know, it's been a very long time. I think the number of grey hairs in our beards are testimony

01:14.640 --> 01:19.040
to, you know, all of the blood, sweat and tears that we've poured into this industry.

01:19.040 --> 01:23.600
Yeah, that's for sure. That's for sure. But it's still a good, I think it's still a good industry

01:23.600 --> 01:32.160
to be in with all the problems that it has. For sure. So, to get us started, tell us about

01:32.160 --> 01:37.840
who is Chris Mills, what you've been up to, what got you to where you are today, and, like,

01:37.840 --> 01:46.640
maybe a little bit of looking forward as well. Okay. So, like all of the best people in the

01:46.640 --> 01:52.480
open standards community, I didn't do any kind of formal education in development or programming

01:52.480 --> 01:57.520
or computer science or anything like that. I was always super interested in technology

01:57.520 --> 02:03.920
from when I was really young. I do remember doing my first bits of programming on a ZX Spectrum 48

02:03.920 --> 02:11.040
plus back in probably the late 80s or something, and that was good fun. Although I do remember

02:11.040 --> 02:16.960
like the sheer amount of lines you had to write just to, like, create, like, an eight by eight

02:16.960 --> 02:22.080
square, you know, an eight by eight pixel character on the screen, and moving it was really,

02:22.080 --> 02:27.200
really challenging. And, you know, you didn't have, like, clever things like events and

02:28.080 --> 02:33.440
moving in terms of mouse cursors and things back in those days. But anyway, this was not intended

02:33.440 --> 02:40.880
to be one of those geekier than thou conversations. But, you know, it's been a bit of a

02:40.880 --> 02:48.080
challenge. But yeah, so at school, I always loved science, and I ended up doing a degree in

02:48.080 --> 02:52.640
biochemistry. And just towards the end of that, I started getting really interested in something

02:52.640 --> 03:03.280
called bioinformatics, which is the study of atoms and molecules and other such things with the help

03:03.280 --> 03:11.120
so we used to download these great big data files off this database in Switzerland, which were like

03:11.120 --> 03:18.560
the exact structural information for different molecules. And then you used to have a local

03:18.560 --> 03:22.560
program which would actually render that to show you like a typical kind of, you know, ball and

03:22.560 --> 03:29.120
socket diagram. And you could do things like you can go, okay, well, if I change this amino acid

03:29.120 --> 03:35.280
in that protein chain, it's got different, you know, attraction, and it's got different positive

03:35.280 --> 03:40.320
and negative attraction values. So how does that change the way that the whole protein folds up

03:40.320 --> 03:46.320
and structures itself? So stuff like that was quite fun and geeky and interesting. But yeah,

03:46.320 --> 03:54.960
didn't really have much luck getting a job in like chemistry or biomedical science type stuff. So I

03:54.960 --> 04:00.400
decided to go for a job at a book publishers instead, and it was Rocks Press. I don't know

04:00.400 --> 04:04.960
if you remember those folks, but back in the day doing books about ASP and ASP.net and stuff.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.360
It was those red book covers with the really ugly author faces all over the covers.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.920
But yeah, that was the place I ended up and did a bunch of books about

04:16.160 --> 04:20.640
web standards and about all sorts of stuff. It was there that I met Bruce Lawson, who has been

04:20.640 --> 04:25.040
one of my long standing partners in crime in the open standards industry. And we started the

04:26.320 --> 04:32.800
Glasshouse imprint, which was one of the first publishing imprints dedicated to open standards

04:32.800 --> 04:42.880
books. And then around 2003 or so this is Rocks Press went horribly bankrupt, and I ended up

04:42.880 --> 04:48.880
working for these nice folks called A Press over in California. And it was there that I ended up

04:48.880 --> 04:52.640
becoming managing editor of Friends of Ed. I don't know if you remember Friends of Ed at all, but

04:52.640 --> 05:01.600
they were. I do, I do. Yeah. Originally did books about Flash and Photoshop, but we kind of turned

05:01.600 --> 05:07.280
it into turn that around and turned it into a an open standards book publisher. So did a whole

05:07.280 --> 05:14.480
bunch of books on HTML and CSS and DOM scripting stuff. We published Jeremy Keefe's first book on

05:14.480 --> 05:21.040
DOM scripting and a number of other great titles. But about that time, I felt it was time to move

05:21.040 --> 05:27.280
past the publishing industry. And my first proper job in web standard stuff was an opera.

05:28.880 --> 05:34.320
And I do miss those days back with folks like Bruce and Patrick Lauker and

05:35.040 --> 05:40.000
Henny Swan and Dan Davis doing open evangelism. It was an interesting time that because

05:40.000 --> 05:44.800
opera never really had much of a market share, but we seem to have a disproportionately large voice in

05:44.800 --> 05:53.360
terms of doing standard stuff. And then after a good few years there, it was time to go to Mozilla

05:53.360 --> 06:00.640
and work on MDN, which is where it started to get really interesting, I think. And yeah, at that

06:00.640 --> 06:07.120
point, I spent eight years working on MDN, doing lots of content on lots of different web APIs and

06:07.120 --> 06:14.320
CSS stuff. After a while, it felt like time to move on. This is getting really boring, isn't it?

06:14.320 --> 06:22.560
And fast forward a couple of years, and yeah, I ended up at the point where I wanted to start

06:22.560 --> 06:28.400
something new again after doing a couple of years at Okta, doing identity and access management

06:28.400 --> 06:35.440
documentation. And at this point, I've started up my own company called Mills Docs Limited, and

06:35.440 --> 06:44.720
I'm now an independent documentation writer specializing in open standards, doing as much of

06:44.720 --> 06:49.600
that good stuff as I can. And funnily enough, one of my first clients is Google, who have got me back

06:49.600 --> 06:55.120
writing stuff on MDN again. So it's kind of a bit of a kind of a weird boomerang situation, but I'm

06:55.120 --> 07:00.160
very happy with where I've ended up, because also it means I get to talk to nice people like yourself

07:00.160 --> 07:03.280
a bit more often. So yeah, it feels like a good place to be right now.

07:03.280 --> 07:09.280
That's amazing. That's a great story. And a lot of that stuff I have no idea about.

07:09.280 --> 07:15.200
That's quite the leap from bioinformatics and protein folding to book publishing.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.800
Did that kind of just like happen? Was it intentional? Was there an interest in that always?

07:22.480 --> 07:29.360
So when I was at university, I can remember sitting there messing about on things like

07:29.360 --> 07:37.280
GeoCities and MySpace playing with HTML and CSS stuff. But I never really had it in mind that I'd

07:37.280 --> 07:42.480
do that stuff for a living. It was more a case of when I left university and went, oh crap,

07:42.480 --> 07:46.640
I need to get a job now, the government aren't paying me to sit around in my student flats,

07:46.640 --> 07:52.400
and even flat anymore. I thought, what the hell am I going to do? So I looked around,

07:52.400 --> 07:56.960
I applied for a few jobs doing biochemistry related stuff, and realized actually,

07:56.960 --> 08:01.360
it's really hard to get a job around here because I don't have a PhD. So I went,

08:01.360 --> 08:05.600
ah, what the hell else am I going to do? And then I think by chance, I saw an advert saying,

08:05.600 --> 08:11.840
trainee technical editors wanted to work on books about programming and HTML and stuff.

08:11.840 --> 08:16.000
And I thought, oh, I know what HTML stands for. So I might be in with a shot for that job.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.080
And it was cool, because whereas the kind of science bodies that I tried to get jobs with

08:22.080 --> 08:26.240
in stuff related to my degree were kind of very formal, you know, had to go in there in a suit

08:26.240 --> 08:33.280
and be quizzed by lots of panels of scientists, this was a much more chilled out, relaxing kind

08:33.280 --> 08:40.720
of outlook. I can remember when I got my interview at Rock's Press being told, turn up in casual

08:40.720 --> 08:44.400
clothes. And I was thinking, whoa, is that like a trap? Am I going to turn up and they're going to

08:44.400 --> 08:49.840
be like, hey, you're not wearing a suit, screw you, man. And I was like, I'm not wearing a suit,

08:49.840 --> 08:55.920
you're not wearing a suit, screw you, man. But I turned it up. I turned up wearing, you know,

08:55.920 --> 09:01.040
ripped jeans and a Sepultura t-shirt and got on very well with them. And they were like, hey,

09:01.040 --> 09:07.280
this guy seems all right. We'll give him a job. So yeah, it was pretty much partially an accident

09:07.280 --> 09:11.840
and partially just like, hey, this sounds cool. Let's try this out. And it turned out being

09:11.840 --> 09:18.240
a really good direction to go in. So that's brilliant. Yeah, it is one of the things I

09:18.240 --> 09:27.440
also enjoy about tech is that it is for the most part, I don't know, I fit more with the

09:27.440 --> 09:32.960
people in tech. I think it's what it boils down to. I wouldn't have made it in a corporate like

09:32.960 --> 09:38.240
wearing a suit kind of thing. Like even in school, I constantly got into trouble because I wasn't

09:38.240 --> 09:42.320
wearing a tie, but I was wearing a jersey. And it's like, you have to wear the two together.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.520
And I was like, that doesn't make any sense. And I'm not going to wear a tie.

09:45.520 --> 09:50.080
So yeah, the fact that I don't have to wear a tie and a suit to do my job,

09:50.080 --> 09:58.720
I think is a good thing. But you mentioned that you have now gone the independent route and started

09:58.720 --> 10:05.200
Mills Docks, which by the way, I love the name. And I'm always super excited when I hear people

10:05.200 --> 10:11.440
doing this. It's very hard. It's scary and all these things. But I think the potential for

10:11.440 --> 10:18.000
entrepreneurship and for startups and these kinds of things to create opportunity for others down

10:18.000 --> 10:24.800
the line is what excites me about it. And that is why I'm doing what I'm doing with my company,

10:24.800 --> 10:30.800
why I decided like, I have this company name that kind of started out as a way to be able to keep

10:30.800 --> 10:36.400
working for Mozilla. But then I was like, well, wait a minute, maybe I should try and do something

10:36.400 --> 10:42.160
with this. I've built up so many connections with so many people. I've been privileged to be able

10:42.160 --> 10:49.520
to do that through the work I did or still do at Mozilla. And I have this burning passion for

10:49.520 --> 10:54.880
open web, open standards, accessibility, all this stuff, and sharing my knowledge and stuff

10:54.880 --> 10:59.840
with other people. So I was like, can I somehow take all these things and build a company around

10:59.840 --> 11:07.520
it? And I've had some failed attempts, but I think it's because I was trying to do, I wasn't doing

11:07.520 --> 11:12.720
what I wanted to do. So what I wanted to do and what I was doing, they were kind of at odds with

11:12.720 --> 11:21.760
each other. But I think I found my way finally during the course of this year. But enough about

11:21.760 --> 11:30.880
me. I'm curious about what made you decide to take this leap of faith and what is your hopes

11:30.880 --> 11:40.640
for Millstocks? So it's something I've wanted to do for at least a decade, but I've always kind of

11:40.640 --> 11:44.880
had the excuses and the fears coming up in the back of my mind. You know, it's like the main fear,

11:44.880 --> 11:49.840
of course, is, am I still going to be able to find work to pay my mortgage, you know,

11:49.840 --> 11:53.920
going to be able to find work to pay my mortgage and feed my family? Or are we going to end up,

11:53.920 --> 11:57.680
you know, painting a colourful cardboard box on the side of the road in three months?

11:59.280 --> 12:03.760
And it's pretty much purely that fear that kept me from doing it for the longest,

12:03.760 --> 12:09.440
longest time. And looking back on it, you know, I keep, I've said to my wife a couple of times,

12:09.440 --> 12:15.440
you know, I wish I'd done this years ago, because it seems great. And she's just like, but you keep

12:15.440 --> 12:19.920
saying that, but you can't say that, you know, because the right time arrives, and it's the right

12:19.920 --> 12:23.200
time, you can't sort of say, oh, well, the right time would have been 10 years ago, because it

12:23.200 --> 12:30.080
obviously wasn't because you didn't do it. But I suppose, like, on that note, I think the main

12:30.080 --> 12:35.520
thing to try and do is to try and make sure that you've got at least a couple of months of money

12:35.520 --> 12:40.400
built up so that if everything does go wrong, you can still pay the bills and things just for a

12:40.400 --> 12:46.160
little while while you're figuring it out. The other option, which I also know that some people

12:46.160 --> 12:52.480
have done in the past is pretty much, you know, work two jobs until you get your own business

12:53.760 --> 12:58.480
like going enough and buoyant enough to be able to then just jack in your regular day job.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.960
I remember talking to some folks like Mark Bolton a long time ago about that,

13:04.960 --> 13:10.080
and being really fascinated by, you know, the idea of how you can have enough tenacity to survive two

13:10.080 --> 13:14.080
jobs, you know, like working your day job, and then like working your own company through the

13:14.080 --> 13:19.680
evening and into the small hours to try and I think, I think that's a great kind of vision.

13:19.680 --> 13:24.640
And it's, I'm really impressed if anyone that can do that. But I think really, I'm just too old and

13:24.640 --> 13:30.400
knackered to do that now, you know, I'm getting old, I just can't cope with working 16 hours a

13:30.400 --> 13:35.520
day anymore. Although I have done it from time to time in the past when there's been crunch periods,

13:35.520 --> 13:40.000
don't get me wrong, we all have, but it's not a sustainable, sensible way to try and live your

13:40.000 --> 13:49.680
life at any age, really. I think the next thing to think about really is that the best time really

13:49.680 --> 13:55.120
is when you can kind of, again, we have advantages, you know, we have immense privilege in the

13:55.120 --> 14:02.080
opportunities we've had for a whole number of reasons. And, but I think anyone can build up a

14:02.080 --> 14:07.760
number of connections, regardless of what walk of life you come from. You just have to have been

14:07.760 --> 14:13.840
around for a while, had a little bit of luck, met some good people, but really the best way to do

14:13.840 --> 14:22.640
that is to go out there, be happy and friendly and helpful and just be positive and kind in as many

14:22.640 --> 14:27.920
situations as you can, because that kind of thing really does get paid back to you in droves.

14:30.320 --> 14:34.880
And then, you know, once you've done enough of that stuff for a few years, you'll then

14:34.880 --> 14:41.120
start to see opportunities, you know, I think that's one thing, regardless of how much crap that

14:42.000 --> 14:50.320
life throws your way, just never stop being kind and empathic and helping others, because

14:50.320 --> 14:55.600
I really think that stuff will come back eventually, even if it doesn't seem like it sometimes.

14:56.720 --> 15:01.360
You know, I sit here saying that, but I'm white and male and incredibly privileged.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.320
But it's not as if I haven't worked hard to get where I am, you know, I've done a ton of work

15:06.320 --> 15:11.920
for a very long time. And I think that stuff has resulted in me eventually being in a situation

15:11.920 --> 15:21.280
where I have enough contacts that a couple of really good contracts were brought up through

15:21.280 --> 15:26.800
the contacts I had, that allowed me to think, hell, this stuff will be what I need to last me

15:26.800 --> 15:33.360
at least a year or so, you know, and this is the time that the time is now right to start my own

15:33.360 --> 15:38.160
company. So that's that's kind of how I eventually arrived at that. It wasn't as if it was a great

15:38.160 --> 15:44.000
plan for a long time, but just in a in about maybe a six month period, I kind of went from

15:44.000 --> 15:50.800
going well, I feel like I want to move on from my current job. A couple of jobs that I applied for

15:50.800 --> 15:56.000
didn't really work out for a couple of reasons. And then from that I kind of went well, there's

15:56.000 --> 15:59.920
the combination of that and a couple of opportunities that are looking likely and let's

15:59.920 --> 16:05.280
just take that chance and jump kind of thing. It always feels frightening, but you know,

16:05.280 --> 16:12.640
I'd like to stress to anybody listening that once you've done it, provided that you're hard

16:12.640 --> 16:16.480
working, and you've got integrity, and you've got a few contacts, and you've just got that

16:16.480 --> 16:22.880
discipline to really work hard to begin with, and really sort of get all of that stuff built

16:22.880 --> 16:28.400
up that you need to make a good go of it, I think you should succeed. And after a few months,

16:28.400 --> 16:32.320
you'll be sitting there like me thinking, why the heck didn't I do this like years ago?

16:32.320 --> 16:38.240
So it feels good. I mean, it particularly feels good to hardly attend any meetings anymore,

16:38.240 --> 16:42.480
and to be your own boss and to really be able to just decide what you want to work on all the time.

16:44.480 --> 16:48.320
And yeah, I think the other thing for me as well is that, you know, I did a whole bunch of management

16:48.320 --> 16:53.600
in my employed career. But I kind of felt like I wanted to take a bit of a rest from that and

16:53.600 --> 16:59.680
just sort of get back to individual contribution again. I think one of the key issues behind

16:59.680 --> 17:04.240
management is just making sure that you understand the problems that all of your direct reports are

17:04.240 --> 17:09.200
going through and be able to understand what they're doing. And to do that, really, you have

17:09.200 --> 17:13.920
to have a bunch of experience in actually doing the job yourself. But I started to feel like I was

17:13.920 --> 17:18.240
getting a bit too far away from the job itself. And I wanted to get back to that. But yeah,

17:18.240 --> 17:23.440
at the end of the day, I just love discussing and writing great documentation. That's what

17:23.440 --> 17:27.040
I'm here for. And it feels great to have got back to a much purer form of that.

17:27.040 --> 17:33.200
And the other thing that you asked about was future plans. I think what I really want to do

17:33.200 --> 17:38.320
is, you know, I'm working hard for the first year or so just to build up some great connections and

17:38.320 --> 17:44.640
to do some great work. And also, you know, just as importantly, to build up a bit of cash in the

17:44.640 --> 17:50.480
company so that I can start to then chill out a bit after that. But I think my longer term plans are

17:51.760 --> 17:56.000
I want to get to the point where I don't have to work quite as much every week. So

17:56.000 --> 18:01.360
I can hopefully start to spend some time teaching some people, mentoring some people and start to

18:01.360 --> 18:08.720
give back to the community that way. One thing that I've always found a bit sad in the companies

18:08.720 --> 18:13.920
that I've worked for, you know, you get a lot of great people, you get some companies doing some

18:13.920 --> 18:20.160
great work, but there rarely seems to be that much time for mentorships and to actually get juniors

18:20.160 --> 18:26.480
on board and skill them up and help with that kind of thing. Companies always seem to want stuff done

18:26.480 --> 18:30.320
really quickly. So they always hire really experienced people and pay them loads of money

18:30.320 --> 18:35.120
to do the work really fast. But it'd be great just to chill out a bit and just take that sort of

18:35.120 --> 18:39.120
more chilled out longer term view of, you know, let's do this a little bit more slowly, but

18:39.120 --> 18:44.400
actually skill up some people into the bargain. That's really what I want to head towards eventually.

18:44.400 --> 18:54.720
Yeah, that's great. I love that. So when I get somebody on the podcast, I spend some time like

18:55.920 --> 19:01.600
researching on them as much as I can to find topics that I know they might be interested in

19:01.600 --> 19:06.640
talking about or things that I didn't know and I'd like to learn more about stuff like that.

19:06.640 --> 19:13.440
You made it really easy because you sent out a tweet a while back in response to Bruce Lawson,

19:13.440 --> 19:21.440
I think it was. And it's like the question was, what can you talk about with any heads up that

19:21.440 --> 19:26.320
you're going to have to talk? And you posted a couple of topics that you can talk about without

19:26.320 --> 19:34.160
being prompted. So I want to dig into some of those topics. The first one I find particularly

19:34.160 --> 19:41.200
interesting because I think people don't really know what technical writing is. And I think there's

19:41.200 --> 19:46.640
more people that would actually find it super interesting and we love doing that. But because

19:46.640 --> 19:52.080
I don't know what it is, they might think that, oh no, these are like people who've gone and done

19:52.720 --> 19:59.600
doctorates and PhDs on how a computer functions. I will never be able to do that.

19:59.600 --> 20:07.920
So can you, from your perspective, break down what is technical writing and what does somebody need

20:07.920 --> 20:15.760
if they are thinking like, okay, this is starting to sound interesting to me. What is the road

20:15.760 --> 20:22.800
you follow to becoming a technical writer? Oh, that is a really interesting question.

20:22.800 --> 20:28.960
I mean, that could be a very short or a very long answer. I suspect we haven't got time here to make

20:28.960 --> 20:34.720
it a really long answer. So I'll try and get it somewhere in the middle. So I guess my short to

20:34.720 --> 20:42.720
medium length answer would be that I think with technical writing, there's two main parts to it.

20:43.520 --> 20:49.600
One of which is investigation and research. That's one thing that you've got to have an

20:49.600 --> 20:56.880
aptitude for. And the other thing is being able to break down complex subjects and explain them

20:56.880 --> 21:03.760
clearly to people to help them understand them. So that's really the two sides of the story.

21:03.760 --> 21:08.720
So with everything that you need to write some documentation about, you first need to do a bunch

21:08.720 --> 21:14.400
of research. You need to go, okay, for a start, what's the target audience here? What's the target

21:14.400 --> 21:19.040
audience for the technology or the product that I'm about to write something concerning?

21:22.480 --> 21:28.480
Is it a developer? Is it a DevOps person? Is it a designer? Is it a variety of different people?

21:28.480 --> 21:33.200
Is it maybe even someone that's not very technical, someone who has no technical knowledge

21:33.200 --> 21:39.520
and wants to sort of get started in this particular technology or field? There's also other things to

21:39.520 --> 21:48.720
consider such as what is the prerequisite knowledge? Is this for complete beginners or is it for

21:48.720 --> 21:52.720
advanced level people who just want to get better at stuff and they already know the basics?

21:52.720 --> 21:57.920
What are the other technologies that you need to already know before you start using this

21:57.920 --> 22:02.080
particular thing that you're writing about? So there's all of that stuff. When you've got that

22:02.080 --> 22:10.000
figured out, it's usually a good idea to sit there and put yourself in the mindset of that person

22:10.000 --> 22:13.680
that you're writing this document. Think to yourself, okay, what are the questions they're

22:13.680 --> 22:18.000
going to have about this thing I'm writing about? What is it that they're going to want to know?

22:18.000 --> 22:21.840
At that point, you can start to think about what to write about the actual technology,

22:21.840 --> 22:25.920
and you've got to scope the work carefully, as you do with any task that you're doing,

22:25.920 --> 22:31.120
whether you're a developer or a bricklayer or a plumber or whatever. Think to yourself, okay,

22:31.120 --> 22:36.480
so I could write all of this stuff about this technology, but what do I actually need to do

22:36.480 --> 22:42.240
first? As with any complex task, it's a good idea to break it down into different phases to go,

22:42.240 --> 22:50.160
okay, first of all, I'm going to write down, I'm going to create just the quick start for this

22:50.160 --> 22:54.880
particular technology, just the one or two articles that help someone get into it in 10 minutes flat.

22:54.880 --> 23:03.200
Then after that, I'll start to do further phases to create reference material which explains

23:03.200 --> 23:06.560
everything you could possibly want to do and allow you to look up things or

23:06.560 --> 23:11.680
other advanced tutorials to write. Once you've got the scope of the work, you then need to go

23:11.680 --> 23:16.480
and start investigating exactly what do I need to put into each of these documents that I'm going

23:16.480 --> 23:23.120
to write. Usually, this involves a lot of hard self-reflection where you realize how little you

23:23.120 --> 23:27.440
actually know about this stuff versus what you thought you knew about it. That's one of the main

23:27.440 --> 23:31.920
reckonings to come up against, and you just have to go through it and figure out what you need to

23:31.920 --> 23:37.040
do. I'll give you an example, so today I was attempting to create a load of documentation about

23:37.040 --> 23:45.680
some new options to do with the Screen Capture API on MDN, and I sat there and I read through loads of

23:45.680 --> 23:50.800
blog posts to help me just to understand the API in the first place because I'm not hugely familiar

23:50.800 --> 23:57.280
about screen capture, and I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with the screen capture

23:57.280 --> 24:02.960
to help me just to understand the API in the first place because I'm not hugely familiar with it.

24:04.560 --> 24:09.920
Then I went through and looked through the Google Chrome source code to try and figure out

24:09.920 --> 24:16.800
exactly which bits of it they implement and exactly which bits they don't, and which classes

24:16.800 --> 24:23.040
are all of these different properties and options that I'm wanting to write about? Which classes

24:23.040 --> 24:26.080
are they hanging off? What constructor are they involved with? Where do I need to put this

24:26.080 --> 24:34.000
documentation on the site? And then another thing I tend to do at this point is that I write myself

24:34.000 --> 24:39.120
a great big research document just to record all of that information so that I can then look back

24:39.120 --> 24:45.040
on it and go ah that's what I need to write about. Another thing at this point to do which I think

24:45.040 --> 24:50.160
is a really good idea is start off by writing one or two paragraphs about each thing that you're

24:50.160 --> 24:54.640
trying to document just to make sure you understand what it is that you're writing about, because if

24:54.640 --> 24:59.280
you can't explain to yourself in a few words what you're going to be writing about you sure as hell

24:59.280 --> 25:04.240
won't be able to do that for other people. So I think I'm starting to waffle a bit so I think

25:04.240 --> 25:11.360
I'll leave that in terms of the research and investigation part, but then onto the actual

25:11.360 --> 25:18.000
writing of the stuff. When you're writing this involves of course a decent amount of aptitude

25:18.000 --> 25:22.800
with language, whichever language it is that you're writing documentation in. You need to be able to

25:22.800 --> 25:31.120
explain things really clearly. A general good rule of thumb is that you need to you need to write

25:31.120 --> 25:39.040
so that you're trying to explain this to like you know maybe like a high school kid or something

25:39.040 --> 25:43.760
like that. You know there's going to be quite a lot of complex terminology that you're going to

25:43.760 --> 25:49.760
need to use, but you should make sure that you only use the term the complex terminology that

25:49.760 --> 25:54.880
you have to use. Make sure you explain to it, explain the stuff you're talking about in as

25:54.880 --> 25:59.680
clear language as you possibly can. Don't use jargon unless you absolutely have to.

26:01.200 --> 26:06.960
So there's the language part of it. I think also there's the style part of it. You know you need

26:06.960 --> 26:10.960
to make sure that the stuff is grammatically correct in terms of the language you're writing,

26:10.960 --> 26:17.040
but you also need to add some style and some fun into it to make it so that not only can it be

26:17.040 --> 26:22.560
understood, but it also makes the technology exciting to learn and interesting. It makes

26:22.560 --> 26:27.280
people want to actually read the stuff you're writing about. I mean that comes with practice

26:27.280 --> 26:34.400
and comes with quite you know a few years of building it up. But yeah I think I'm going to

26:34.400 --> 26:38.320
stop there of the writing as well because I mean I really could talk for hours about this stuff,

26:38.320 --> 26:46.960
but yeah really investigation and writing. Notice that I haven't mentioned programming ability or

26:47.840 --> 26:54.160
web development ability or anything like that. I think really that stuff is all incidental to

26:54.160 --> 26:59.840
the stuff that you're going to be documenting. So obviously it really really helps and you do kind

26:59.840 --> 27:06.640
of need to be able to understand the technologies that you're writing about. But in a way that's

27:06.640 --> 27:12.160
kind of like a background detail I think to just the first two which are really the more important

27:12.160 --> 27:18.560
focus. So you'll be able to pick up the technologies gradually as you go along,

27:19.200 --> 27:23.520
but your focus should really be the sort of the passion to investigate

27:23.520 --> 27:26.800
and explain and to teach the stuff that you want to write about.

27:26.800 --> 27:38.160
I hope that answered the question. Yeah no it totally did. Do you think it can be a good

27:38.160 --> 27:46.400
way to learn? Like if you, not pretend, but if you play the role of a technical writer in your own

27:46.400 --> 27:54.720
learning journey and so as you learn stuff you write about it in a way that maybe helps you

27:54.720 --> 28:03.600
understand it better yourself? Totally. I think that's another great use of

28:05.120 --> 28:10.640
blogging or tweeting as it's kind of become, although hey maybe not for much longer.

28:11.840 --> 28:19.520
But yeah you know I think it totally helps. Like I've had, I've talked to loads of people

28:19.520 --> 28:25.200
about this, like I remember talking to Estelle about this who now works for OpenWebDocs documenting

28:25.200 --> 28:30.640
stuff on MDN and she was kind of saying that you know before we contracted her originally to work

28:30.640 --> 28:36.560
on MDN she was saying hell this is great you know I really enjoy playing with technology,

28:36.560 --> 28:40.640
I really enjoy writing about it on my blog and explaining it to other people so that they can

28:40.640 --> 28:45.520
use it and it sounds like now you're going to basically pay me for something that I really

28:45.520 --> 28:51.040
enjoy doing anyway and it's kind of like well that's totally cool to be able to get in roads

28:51.040 --> 28:55.520
but I mean the salient point there is that I think that's basically what her and a lot of other

28:55.520 --> 29:01.280
people have done you know it's like well I want to understand this technology so rather than just

29:01.280 --> 29:06.000
writing a bunch of code examples and messing about with code which is, let's face it that's

29:06.000 --> 29:11.520
also a great way to learn you know don't just stop there, create a code example but then also

29:11.520 --> 29:16.400
explain how that works in a blog post and it helps you understand it even better so yeah I would

29:16.400 --> 29:24.880
absolutely agree with that. Cool yeah I agree I think it's helped me differently and it still does

29:24.880 --> 29:32.640
if I learn something new I often find it good to after the fact kind of try and write what I learned

29:33.920 --> 29:39.280
or how I got to the answer of like this is the problem I faced this is how I got there

29:39.280 --> 29:45.600
and then fill in the gap. Not only now do I have an artifact that I can look back at

29:46.160 --> 29:50.720
but I have kind of proved to myself that I do understand it actually.

29:53.120 --> 29:58.240
I think yeah absolutely I think one problem that does tend to come up from time to time is

29:59.360 --> 30:05.360
the kind of scoping of the writing and the examples so you know you can if you want to

30:05.360 --> 30:13.680
document a single property then you can do that and the code example might just be like a single

30:13.680 --> 30:18.880
line of JavaScript but then you've got to think about well actually does that help me use this

30:18.880 --> 30:25.360
in the real world what context do I need to use that in to actually make real use of it in a real

30:25.360 --> 30:30.480
application and what scaffolding code has to sit behind it before that's actually effective and

30:30.480 --> 30:37.920
useful and then you've got to kind of play with the scoping and figure out okay you know that's

30:37.920 --> 30:43.760
just one line of code but to actually make it useful it's got to sit inside this giant

30:43.760 --> 30:48.880
application that does all of this other stuff in the background but in terms of teaching someone

30:48.880 --> 30:53.120
how to use these individual properties you can't show them like an entire application's worth of

30:53.120 --> 30:59.520
code on every page you've got to kind of structure the examples so that you're making each individual

30:59.520 --> 31:06.720
piece understandable while still kind of providing that useful real world context in how you're going

31:06.720 --> 31:11.760
to use it so that's a bit of a balance that you need to achieve as you as you go through technical

31:11.760 --> 31:15.760
writing and it's something that you just learn to do as you go forward you know there's

31:16.800 --> 31:22.880
there's one one danger that I see people do a lot in technical writing is too many kitchen sink

31:22.880 --> 31:28.240
examples so too many examples that show you how to do everything when actually you're just trying

31:28.240 --> 31:34.160
to show someone how to how to use one single property you know the the best code examples

31:34.160 --> 31:40.480
for technical writing just show how to do one thing well but they also show how show it how to

31:40.480 --> 31:51.360
do it in a way that's transferable into the real world yeah yeah I I think writing good examples

31:51.360 --> 32:00.560
is really a art form because I oftentimes the the examples you see people use aren't really

32:01.120 --> 32:07.360
connected to any real world use case and so it's almost like you're learning something in the

32:07.360 --> 32:12.640
abstract and you're so now you kind of understand on a technical level better what this thing is

32:13.360 --> 32:20.240
but you still find it a little hard to understand how do I use this to solve an actual problem so

32:20.240 --> 32:27.520
I think being able to connect those two things is really important yep no absolutely I think

32:28.640 --> 32:35.760
the second biggest mistake I always see in code examples for technical writing is when people write

32:36.880 --> 32:42.000
a code snippets that's really really clever but really hard to understand you know so it's like

32:42.640 --> 32:46.960
fair enough you're a fantastic programmer this thing that I wrote in 10 lines you've

32:46.960 --> 32:51.760
shown me how to do in two lines but actually my thing is a lot easier for people to understand

32:51.760 --> 32:59.760
what's actually happening you know it's like you know when I when I return the value of that

32:59.760 --> 33:06.640
property what object does that return and then I need to use a method that's hang that's hanging

33:06.640 --> 33:13.360
off of that particular object and you know usually and you get some sort of chain like

33:13.360 --> 33:17.680
that and you go well actually even though you could do that with one line it's often helpful

33:17.680 --> 33:22.800
to sort of separate that out into the individual steps across three or four lines just so that

33:22.800 --> 33:28.720
people can actually grok the chain of the chain of events that's a terrible term which will

33:28.720 --> 33:33.840
be completely misconstrued the the different happenings that's going from start to finish

33:33.840 --> 33:38.320
at that one line because otherwise it's just too difficult to get it if you've only seen that for

33:38.320 --> 33:47.280
the first time yeah I completely agree so um I think well I don't think I know because I've

33:47.280 --> 33:54.480
heard this many times and experience with myself that documentation is often the what makes the

33:54.480 --> 34:00.640
difference between a successful open source project and a failure and you've been involved

34:00.640 --> 34:05.120
in quite a number of open source projects that has really good documentation for example web

34:05.120 --> 34:10.880
docs mdn web docs what has been some of the takeaways some of the stuff that you've learned

34:10.880 --> 34:15.840
that you think is key to running a successful documentation project be it for an open source

34:15.840 --> 34:20.720
project or closed source doesn't really matter but more of a focus may be on the open source side

34:22.880 --> 34:31.840
okay um I think one of the number one important things is having really really clear processing

34:31.840 --> 34:43.040
guidelines because if you don't have clear guidelines then you just end up with really

34:43.040 --> 34:50.480
really bad inconsistency everywhere and it's okay if you've only got 10 pages but when you build

34:50.480 --> 34:56.480
it up to a behemoth of a sort of size of mdn you then realize that you've got so many documents

34:56.480 --> 35:01.040
so much documentation debt sat there that it's going to be nearly impossible to fix it all

35:01.040 --> 35:07.680
and then it requires some passionate dedicated people to spend hundreds of hours fixing stuff up

35:07.680 --> 35:11.840
just to get things not even particularly being that much better but just being consistent

35:13.920 --> 35:21.520
but then again you know it's not so it's not so obvious what the improvement is when you just

35:21.520 --> 35:28.160
fix a small number of those kind of paper kit paper cut inconsistency fixes but then when you

35:28.160 --> 35:32.720
start to look at the whole project from a much higher level you then realize actually this is

35:32.720 --> 35:38.480
just improving the quality and the polish of this thing so much but really it starts to become the

35:38.480 --> 35:46.320
difference between the project living and dying um so in terms of guidelines this can be things

35:46.320 --> 35:51.920
like you know exactly how do we take an image what size does the image need to be does it need to be

35:51.920 --> 35:58.320
centered on the page or left aligned do i need to make sure that i capture it at a high enough

35:58.320 --> 36:03.520
resolution so it doesn't start to look really pixely and crappy on high-res screen devices

36:04.320 --> 36:09.920
all of these kind of things well what what kind of language guidelines do we use do we

36:12.640 --> 36:17.120
do we have sentence case capitalization on headings you know all of this kind of stuff

36:17.120 --> 36:20.960
it's just good to keep that stuff in mind and make sure you try and apply it

36:20.960 --> 36:28.560
as consistently as possible now i also mentioned process so particularly in terms of things like

36:28.560 --> 36:35.200
open source projects process is things like okay if i've submitted submitted a pull request

36:37.280 --> 36:41.920
who's responsible for reviewing that how long can i expect to wait for a review

36:43.600 --> 36:47.840
what am i expected to do to make it as easy as possible for other people to review

36:47.840 --> 36:54.640
um these kind of things are also very important you know and not only is it good to have process

36:54.640 --> 37:02.480
and guidelines to make the work better itself and the flow of work better but it's also great for

37:02.480 --> 37:06.560
covering covering your own back as well if somebody starts to complain and say hey well

37:06.560 --> 37:11.360
that thing's like that you can just you can just point to the process doc and say hey that's

37:11.360 --> 37:17.200
because it's outlined in the process doc or it's outlined in these guidelines rather than

37:17.200 --> 37:20.960
rather than just kind of making stuff up on the fly every time you get asked that question which

37:20.960 --> 37:25.040
can lead to bad feeling when people see that you're making inconsistent decisions or

37:25.760 --> 37:29.840
doing things that look like you're favoring one contributor over another contributor

37:29.840 --> 37:32.240
so i'd say all of that stuff is really really important

37:34.640 --> 37:39.440
it processes also when you start to get something where you get the number of

37:39.440 --> 37:44.400
contributions that you do on mdn web docs and you know speaking to you as the community manager

37:44.400 --> 37:50.560
of mdn web docs you know only too well just how much work it is to do that and try and manage

37:50.560 --> 37:57.440
the community and manage who's doing what issue who's fixing what problem um you know process is

37:57.440 --> 38:03.120
also hugely important for just trying to make sense of an enormous great big volume of issues

38:03.120 --> 38:10.000
and pull requests flying at you all the time um so i think those are the two main things really

38:10.000 --> 38:18.480
um in terms of other things that are important to think about for open source projects um i think

38:19.280 --> 38:25.680
also part of the process and really this is coming into governance you need things like code of

38:25.680 --> 38:31.840
conduct to make sure that people are treated as fairly as possible and anybody that comes

38:31.840 --> 38:38.880
into the community and is a bad apple and starts being unconstructive or or you know god forbid

38:38.880 --> 38:48.160
abusive um is dealt with using a firm but fair process to make sure that you can keep positive

38:48.160 --> 38:54.720
feeling up um i think also this comes back to mentorship as well you know um as well as making

38:54.720 --> 39:00.240
sure that everything's fair for people you also need to make sure that there's good beginners

39:00.240 --> 39:05.520
documentation to help people get started but then also people to help mentor people and skill them

39:05.520 --> 39:10.560
up so but they can start doing things more autonomously i think the biggest fear with

39:11.760 --> 39:15.520
open source projects is you sit there and you go okay there's three or four of us that are

39:15.520 --> 39:21.440
really autonomous and are getting loads of stuff done but if we stop and start spending some time

39:21.440 --> 39:25.120
mentoring people instead that's going to take up all of our time so how on earth is all of the work

39:25.120 --> 39:29.440
going to get done it's just going to grind to a hole but you need to have a balance don't you

39:29.440 --> 39:33.520
need to carry on doing the good stuff but you also need to spend maybe a little bit of time skilling

39:33.520 --> 39:38.480
people up so that you can then start to see the benefits of that later and then of course as

39:38.480 --> 39:41.920
people start to move on from that project you need to make sure that you've still got people

39:41.920 --> 39:44.560
to carry on the good work there and it doesn't just grind to a hole

39:47.760 --> 39:53.840
yeah so yeah i think that's good advice yeah i think that's the main stuff that i've learned from

39:53.840 --> 40:00.640
open source stuff i think a lot of those are all very good points a lot of big more enterprisey

40:00.640 --> 40:07.360
companies could really benefit from those kind of open source project philosophies i've seen too many

40:09.280 --> 40:14.160
kind of companies which are doing their documentation for their project on github

40:15.120 --> 40:21.680
but mainly just because you know it's convenient to use something like a static site generator

40:21.680 --> 40:29.120
type setup to publish your documentation but then failing to take advantages of

40:29.120 --> 40:34.000
all of the kind of good open source magic that you could get by just opening up that documentation

40:34.000 --> 40:40.000
and encouraging outside contributions you know if you've got your stuff on github but you're

40:41.280 --> 40:45.600
not allowing external contributions then hell what you're doing you know it's just it doesn't

40:45.600 --> 40:52.800
make any sense not to really yeah that's that's very true do you have any like examples of

40:52.800 --> 40:59.040
either companies or open source projects that do this really well

41:06.160 --> 41:15.040
well aside from the obvious you know mdn which is contributed to by loads of companies

41:15.040 --> 41:24.880
um i'm just trying to think um i'm trying to think of a good example of like a company which is

41:26.080 --> 41:35.520
you know pretty much a closed source product but it also takes lots and lots of contributions from

41:36.160 --> 41:38.640
the open source community in terms of its documentation

41:38.640 --> 41:45.360
um amazon from what i can tell seem to be quite good at doing that in terms of aws documentation

41:46.480 --> 41:50.800
i've got a few friends there and they seem to have quite an active kind of

41:52.800 --> 42:00.480
um contributions from the community um i'm not so sure if it's worth really mentioning

42:00.480 --> 42:04.960
google and all of the community contributions they get to their docs because i mean that's like an

42:04.960 --> 42:10.160
open source project anyway you know if you look at chrome it was an open source project

42:11.120 --> 42:17.760
yeah yeah i'm drawing a bit of a blank i'm afraid but i'll have to think about other good examples

42:18.960 --> 42:24.160
have you looked at how getup does their getup docs project because that's been open source now

42:24.160 --> 42:30.400
since mid last year i think oh no i've not really looked at that so much

42:31.760 --> 42:36.320
cool yeah it'd be interesting to know your thoughts on that one um because we have somebody that we

42:36.320 --> 42:42.960
mutually know that works on that project now uh peter benkson he works at getup on the getup docs

42:42.960 --> 42:50.800
project so um you know he's taken a lot of the learnings from mdn there and he's done a lot of

42:50.800 --> 42:55.600
um you know he's taken a lot of the learnings from mdn there but he's also said that

42:56.480 --> 43:01.920
there's also some stuff they do that web docs don't and um there's actually a quite a lot of

43:01.920 --> 43:10.480
uh cross-pollination opening at the moment between uh web docs and getup um to learn from each other

43:11.040 --> 43:15.200
especially now that their docs project is also open source and they are they're starting to

43:15.200 --> 43:20.560
they're starting to experience some of the problems that we've already had and sort of kind of solved

43:20.560 --> 43:27.760
or are more um used to or we're almost at a point where we are kind of solving it uh but they know

43:27.760 --> 43:33.840
the technology we use much better than what we do like getup itself so you know they can help us

43:33.840 --> 43:39.600
again from that perspective so it's quite interesting um how that that kind of relationship

43:39.600 --> 43:46.720
is building up and being mutually beneficial yeah that's that's absolutely great like i'd

43:46.720 --> 43:50.800
completely forgotten that peter had gone over to github but yeah i do remember that now i will have

43:50.800 --> 43:57.600
to look into it yeah yeah interesting to know what you think so um you kind of touched on this when

43:57.600 --> 44:04.240
you mentioned stuff like code of conducts and things like this but um a slightly harder topic

44:04.240 --> 44:10.960
i guess um challenges facing the tech industry like you've been in tech industry quite for quite

44:10.960 --> 44:15.680
some time the tech industry has changed but also stayed the same in many many respects you've worked

44:15.680 --> 44:23.520
at everything from like big open source kind of companies like mozilla but also at octa now recently

44:24.160 --> 44:32.640
um what have you found in your career so far to be like challenges that we just haven't dealt with

44:32.640 --> 44:39.360
with properly yet i mean one of the things that i find fascinating is to learn that of all

44:39.360 --> 44:46.960
contributions made to open source only 13 percent is women and only 17 from africa it seems

44:46.960 --> 44:54.960
disproportionate and i wonder what your thoughts are on on those things it's really hard isn't it

44:54.960 --> 45:04.480
you know the whole um equal opportunities and dni stuff is something that i do care about a great

45:04.480 --> 45:11.120
deal and i would love to be able to help to fix this problem um but i don't think it's something

45:11.120 --> 45:20.480
that can be very easily fixed um you know we have we have a society that's largely set up so that

45:20.480 --> 45:28.720
that it advantages men and white people you know let's just you know and that's me speaking as a

45:28.720 --> 45:34.720
white male i'm i'm painfully aware of that but then again at the same time i'm not because i think if

45:34.720 --> 45:43.520
you don't suffer from prejudices that come from not being white and male you you don't notice them

45:43.520 --> 45:49.280
and you can't even really imagine what effect that has um one thing that i would love to do

45:49.280 --> 45:57.840
um going back to the idea of mentorship is deliberately give mentorship opportunities to

45:58.560 --> 46:06.320
non-white non-males um just to basically try and give a bit back and to help with this whole issue

46:06.320 --> 46:11.120
because you know that the number of times i've heard people complain about oh well you know

46:11.120 --> 46:16.240
it's ridiculous like the amount of effort that's expended expanded on you know trying to give

46:16.240 --> 46:22.000
trying to give opportunities for like you know non-whites and non-males haven't they had enough

46:22.000 --> 46:28.080
and it's like yeah but actually as white males we get those advantages every day of our lives

46:28.080 --> 46:33.600
by default as soon as we wake up without even trying and that's why we can never stop thinking

46:33.600 --> 46:38.640
about this stuff and that's why you know in my own small way i want to do as much as i as much

46:38.640 --> 46:44.880
as i can as i can about this and really i don't think this is a subject i can say too much more

46:44.880 --> 46:50.800
about because i'm painfully aware that as a white male i don't understand it enough yet

46:51.360 --> 46:56.560
and i don't think i'll ever understand it perhaps enough but i can just understand it as much as i

46:56.560 --> 47:03.360
can being in the position that i am yeah so yeah you know yeah i don't even know if it's

47:03.360 --> 47:07.920
i don't even know if it's got particularly that much better in the 20 plus years i've

47:07.920 --> 47:13.280
been in the tech industry i certainly think it's got a bit better but least companies kind of

47:13.280 --> 47:22.480
notice it now but then again i mean i was quite impressed with octa when i worked there but it

47:22.480 --> 47:30.000
seemed octa seemed to be a company that recognize diversity and inclusion challenges but actually

47:30.000 --> 47:34.880
really try and do something about it rather than just kind of paying lip service to it you know

47:36.000 --> 47:40.800
having having a lame-ass little black lives matter sticker in the corner of your

47:40.800 --> 47:44.800
site and then doing absolutely nothing about it apart from that you might as well please

47:44.800 --> 47:50.800
just don't bother it's just pathetic but yeah octa did do a lot more than your average company

47:50.800 --> 47:58.240
in terms of having like focus groups for women lgbt people of color inside the company and really

47:58.240 --> 48:05.760
helping them to get advantages and get opportunities and then they have the whole

48:05.760 --> 48:12.160
octa for good site as well which is their donations in philanthropy type movement which i was quite

48:12.160 --> 48:18.640
impressed impressed by as well so yeah they definitely did more than the default but i'd

48:18.640 --> 48:24.640
like the default just to be more i think that's yeah yeah something that's quite a painful truth

48:24.640 --> 48:31.920
really yeah no for sure no i agree i i do think there's there's a lot of talk but not a lot of

48:31.920 --> 48:38.480
action and this is generally a problem that i have with most of these kinds of things and it

48:38.480 --> 48:44.720
plays into politics we won't go there but um it's always a lot of talk but when it comes down to

48:44.720 --> 48:50.800
doing doing something constructive about it then you know it just goes quiet it's like oh okay

48:50.800 --> 48:54.560
cool so we just like talking about it but we don't actually want to do anything about it

48:54.560 --> 49:01.760
but um yeah no i i mean i've spoken to a couple of folks um who've been directly affected by

49:01.760 --> 49:05.360
these kinds of things and some of these stories are just terrific it's like you can't believe that

49:05.360 --> 49:09.600
this actually happens like here's a person sitting in front of you telling you that this has happened

49:09.600 --> 49:15.760
to me but you still just can't can't wrap your head around the fact that stuff like this happens

49:15.760 --> 49:22.400
to people like where people are um sexualized and stuff like that just openly in an office setting

49:22.400 --> 49:30.320
and you're like i don't i don't understand how does this happen uh so yeah it is something that

49:30.320 --> 49:36.880
i'm also um like uh it i don't know it plays the same kind of role to me as accessibility

49:37.600 --> 49:42.640
um the accessibility of the products we build but also how accessible we make it to actually

49:42.640 --> 49:51.760
enter the industry itself and then um how accessible we make it to get employed um i think

49:51.760 --> 50:00.240
that in itself is a struggle and in africa um trying to build your own business is really

50:00.240 --> 50:06.320
really hard because i i listened to a talk uh interview with a woman from africa she's from

50:06.320 --> 50:10.880
legos but she so she built a business in africa and then she built a business in the united

50:10.880 --> 50:17.440
states and she was talking about the the difference between her experience of these two scenarios and

50:17.440 --> 50:22.880
what it boils down to is the system in the u.s for all the problems the united states have

50:24.400 --> 50:31.120
the system is set up for you to succeed whereas in africa the system is set up to see you fail

50:31.680 --> 50:41.040
and that is a hard truth to acknowledge me being from africa myself i can um corroborate her

50:41.040 --> 50:47.920
experience you're definitely you're fighting constant bureaucracy and red tape to get the most

50:47.920 --> 50:55.120
simplest things done like i'm sitting here speaking to you um but i'm actually connected to a big

50:55.120 --> 51:00.240
battery on the left because our power is currently out and it's going to remain out for the next 30

51:00.240 --> 51:03.520
minutes going to be out for about two hours and then in four hours from now it's going to happen

51:03.520 --> 51:09.920
again because our power grid is just unmaintained and the company running it is completely corrupt

51:09.920 --> 51:16.640
and so you know these are the things you face so you have to luckily i'm in a position where i can

51:16.640 --> 51:22.320
go out and buy that expensive battery to allow me to be able to do this while it's pitch dark around

51:22.320 --> 51:28.800
me um but not everybody is um a lot of people in this country are losing their jobs having to

51:28.800 --> 51:35.840
close their companies simply because the system is set up for them to fail um and so yeah that

51:35.840 --> 51:42.320
that's a very hard thing so for me from my part that is why stuff like accessibility is so important

51:42.320 --> 51:48.400
to me because i know how hard it can be to do the most simplest thing and if i can do something to

51:48.400 --> 51:55.440
make it a little easier for you to do get something done then by all means i think it's my responsibility

51:55.440 --> 52:07.200
to do that absolutely absolutely i think um accessibility is you know just from a more

52:07.840 --> 52:13.280
technical perspective is also another thing that's a major issue in the industry you know i think

52:14.640 --> 52:19.840
this does have quite a lot of similarities to draw across like another thing i've noticed is

52:19.840 --> 52:29.680
just that it seemed to get better for a while um you know with all of the action that um

52:29.680 --> 52:37.360
accessibility advocates did through teaching even basic stuff like just writing proper semantic html

52:37.360 --> 52:44.240
and actually using a freaking button when you mean to use a button and not a stupid div style to

52:44.240 --> 52:48.800
look like a button how many times do we have to say it you know bang head against brick wall

52:48.800 --> 52:54.720
um but it kind of seems to have got slightly worse again of late and i think this is because

52:54.720 --> 52:59.360
the new generation coming into the industry a lot of them tend to do it through

53:01.520 --> 53:06.000
less organically just kind of like right you know there's i'm not saying this is a terrible

53:06.000 --> 53:12.560
thing it's great to give people opportunities to work but the number of college courses and

53:12.560 --> 53:17.280
code boot camps and things that are just like well to get a job you just need to learn react

53:17.280 --> 53:22.080
because that's the most popular library right now so run you through this quick course to teach you

53:22.080 --> 53:26.400
how to build a react app boom you're gone go and get a job and you're like well that's great but

53:28.000 --> 53:33.200
what about all of the sort of html css and javascript knowledge that underpins that

53:33.200 --> 53:37.360
that you really ought to need to know to build a truly accessible effective application i mean

53:38.240 --> 53:44.240
one kind of one anecdote that i can that springs to mind is i i was

53:44.240 --> 53:50.400
asked by a friend of mine to come in and speak at his company about accessibility basics

53:51.280 --> 53:56.880
um to all of his teams and there was quite a few people in his teams that were like fairly young

53:56.880 --> 54:03.760
fairly new coders that were building a bunch of react apps and i thought to myself is it really

54:03.760 --> 54:09.120
useful for me to just walk into here and just give like a 25 minute talk about all of this real basic

54:09.120 --> 54:19.120
nuts and bolts accessibility stuff surely in 2021 but people were absolutely amazed and astounded

54:19.120 --> 54:23.200
by it and we're just like what you mean it's actually important to use html elements other

54:23.200 --> 54:29.120
than div what if something's inaccessible it isn't always the designer's fault it's actually

54:29.120 --> 54:33.600
down to the code as well i was just i couldn't believe like this the sheer lack of knowledge

54:33.600 --> 54:41.440
of this whole company about accessibility and yeah it's just weird to me i suppose again you

54:42.720 --> 54:48.960
you live inside certain bubbles don't you so things aren't always like that everywhere but at

54:48.960 --> 54:53.280
the same time i was quite shocked just by how little there was in terms of accessibility

54:53.280 --> 54:57.040
knowledge there so i think that's another thing that we need to kind of ramp up again

54:57.040 --> 55:05.520
and yeah so i agree i agreed i just last night watched a video where a person was talking about

55:05.520 --> 55:12.160
using vue js and he was talking about okay we're going to create this list of products

55:12.800 --> 55:19.360
and then i was like okay cool and then it's like a list of nested divs and i was like you

55:19.360 --> 55:27.760
you use the word list just now html has lists you know it has different kinds of lists even i think

55:27.760 --> 55:33.520
we should make this list of products with an ordered list maybe maybe that makes sense and

55:33.520 --> 55:39.680
it helps people with accessibility to know this is a list of five items that's useful

55:39.680 --> 55:46.560
useful information for them yeah so no i agree i agree i think it has it has slipped

55:46.560 --> 55:54.400
out but i do see people talking about it but again i think it's again the thing where we need

55:57.360 --> 56:05.680
more than just talk we need examples out there we need courses that teach a library like react

56:05.680 --> 56:14.240
like view like swell like whatever is popular but made by people who care and so who use the proper

56:14.240 --> 56:18.240
semantic structure when they show so they're not just like i'm going to show it to make a

56:18.240 --> 56:23.120
view app but i'm going to show it to make a view app using the power of the open web i'm going to

56:23.120 --> 56:29.520
show you how to use the proper html the proper css and think about stuff like color contrast and

56:31.120 --> 56:35.760
the order of your document and what the outline of your document looks like and all of these good

56:35.760 --> 56:41.200
things and by doing that show you that hey guess what more often than not your application is going

56:41.200 --> 56:47.120
to be more performant because you're not going to reinvent the wheel don't build a select drop down

56:47.120 --> 56:52.240
in react use the one the browser gives you i know it's not super pretty but you can style it

56:52.800 --> 56:57.840
to some extent and at least it's accessible to a much much bigger audience and you're going to

56:57.840 --> 57:03.920
have a lot less of a headache trying to maintain your own little select drop down because you're

57:03.920 --> 57:07.840
now having to reinvent things that the browser has already implemented years ago

57:07.840 --> 57:15.200
yep amen to that brother it's um it's a really difficult one though like i've i've done several

57:15.200 --> 57:21.600
talks at universities where i've just had some person stand up in the back and utter some

57:21.600 --> 57:29.120
immortal words like why not just use native apps for this because this is a pain in the ass and

57:29.120 --> 57:36.560
i'm just like right well you can do that if you want to but the web has so many ways to do it

57:36.560 --> 57:43.760
so the web has so many advantages so much easier in terms of distribution so much easier in terms

57:43.760 --> 57:47.680
of not having to reinstall the damn thing every five minutes whenever there's an update

57:49.200 --> 57:57.040
so much less in terms of weight of um files to get down the pipe to the users there's so many

57:57.040 --> 58:04.080
reasons why the web is a great thing um you know depending on which you what use case it might not

58:04.080 --> 58:08.880
be the best but you know it's good for so many use cases and it's getting better and better so

58:09.920 --> 58:17.840
yeah um it does it it winds me up the number of courses you see that just teach you how to do

58:17.840 --> 58:22.480
great applications but with terrible semantics and no thought at all to that side of things

58:23.440 --> 58:30.400
but you know it's it's kind of it's turning web development into an a sort of very

58:30.400 --> 58:35.840
it's almost bringing it back towards being a computer science discipline where whereas really

58:35.840 --> 58:39.440
it isn't that it's so much more than that and that's why i find the web more interesting than

58:39.440 --> 58:47.920
something like you know developing c++ apps because it's like well you've got this mixture of coding

58:47.920 --> 58:54.640
and design and psychology and all sorts of different things that you have to bring into

58:54.640 --> 58:59.120
this big melting pot of skills to produce something that's great for your users and it just makes

58:59.120 --> 59:06.320
just makes life more interesting yeah for sure i mean that is that's the one reason why

59:07.520 --> 59:13.600
moving from being a musician to being a web developer was not as painful because i didn't

59:13.600 --> 59:21.040
feel i left so that much on the table um i still have a way to express myself um in creative ways

59:21.040 --> 59:28.960
in creative ways um with the web because it is this amalgamation of many different things it's

59:28.960 --> 59:35.040
you know it's not it's not just a science it's an art as well absolutely

59:37.600 --> 59:45.440
so i have two questions remaining and um the one is light-hearted and the other one is really also

59:45.440 --> 59:54.400
but it's also a little philosophical here we go i got it right um so first one um tough one but

59:54.400 --> 01:00:00.960
um what is your top three artists and favorite album and maybe it doesn't have to be all time

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:07.760
maybe it can be in the last two years or maybe it is all time there that's a really hard question

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.920
it's one of those questions that every time i get asked it i come up with a completely different

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:16.960
answer because i listen to so much music i'm completely and utterly obsessed with music

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:24.320
in a really quite some people would say unnatural way my wife certainly seems to think so um although

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.120
i'm getting one of my daughters to be similarly obsessed with music which i'm quite proud of

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:36.320
um so for those of you listening that don't know me i'm completely obsessed by horrible noisy music

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.720
so heavy metal hardcore punk um but i also like a whole bunch of other stuff i'm pretty much into

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:49.840
anything that has a bit of soul and a bit of passion and isn't just soulless manufactured

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:58.960
disposable chart crap um and what have i what have i been listening to recently um i'm just trying

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:07.280
to think so my my favorite horrible noisy band currently is a us band called full of hell who

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:15.600
play really horrible kind of punk grindcore death metal type stuff interesting set of imagery and

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:22.880
artwork um some of their lyrical content seems to be quite philosophical and interesting it's not

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:28.240
just that kind of metal stereotype of gore and guts and horror movie type stuff you know which

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.800
is not the kind of thing that i'm really that into anyway but yeah i'd certainly recommend full of

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:42.480
hell um one of my all-time favorite bands is uh converge again us based kind of another band that

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:50.640
sort of straddles the line between punk and metal um they started off by uh playing what i think

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:56.720
they themselves described as slayer core which was really punk but with slayer riffs um interesting

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.840
and they progressed into something a lot more interesting from there so yes converge are very

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:07.280
good i i saw them recently at the damnation festival in the uk along with full of hell as

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.200
well um but yeah converge played the whole of their classic album jane doe which is really

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:22.320
really really good um so yeah that's great um what else in terms of uh less metal stuff um

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:30.640
um i quite like a lot of dance music um but again not kind of chatty commercial dance music i quite

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:38.640
like breakbeat and glitch and that kind of stuff so i really like afex twin so great artist from

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:45.600
the uk that's been doing weird glitchy stuff for a long long time um also really like square pusher

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:52.080
which is also in the same kind of vein um and there's a there's a fairly famous uk band called

01:02:52.080 --> 01:03:00.240
orbital who do lots of really really great dance stuff um in a way i sometimes find dance music

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.040
easier to code to than really noisy metal stuff you know something that's just like a

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.160
a solid beat and a bit of an ambience in the background that you can really get into

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:17.040
um another one of my favorite bands another one of my favorite bands is the osric tentacles who

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:22.320
are another uk band that play kind of like a mixture of dance music and prog rock and

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.160
kind of weird kind of ethnic instruments and things they're really cool they're quite a

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:34.160
special band for me because i actually met my wife as an osric tentacles gig um and i'm going

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.120
to go and see them this weekend play in manchester uh along with another one of my favorite bands who

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:46.320
are gong i don't know if you've heard of gong g-o-n-g but they're a uh no they were originally like an

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:53.200
english slash french band that started in the late 60s and they sort of invented ambient music

01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:02.160
before it was really a thing um so yeah they play another sort of strange mix of excuse me a mix

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.480
of kind of ambient and prog and quite a lot of silly whale noises and flutes and saxophones as

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:15.920
well so i'd suggest them and then again this list could go on forever but probably my favorite band

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:21.680
of all time at least my favorite band of all time this week is another uk band called the cardiax

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:29.680
who play a mix of kind of a mix of prog and punk so a lot of their stuff sounds a bit aggro-y and

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:36.000
punk but they're also really really really impressively technical musicians who play really

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
complex time structures and things but it sounds really quite punk they're not really around so

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.800
much anymore sadly sadly their frontman and main creative force tim smith died a couple of years

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:57.680
ago after battling a long-standing illness but yeah their music certainly lives on it's a it's

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.800
another one of those bands that kind of no one's ever heard of them and they certainly didn't have

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:08.160
any great commercial success but whenever they used to play a gig they could fill out like a

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.880
few thousand person arena you know they were like you know a massive massively popular band but

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:19.200
really underground at the same time so yeah that's a little bit of a uh a little bit of a snapshot

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.000
into what i've been listening to recently what about yourself man couple of things i'm going

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:32.240
to check out yeah i've been getting into ginger a lot like not ginger like j i n j e r um the

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:39.280
musicianship in that band is just unbelievable like the drummer the guitarists the bassist is

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:47.200
self the stuff he does is mind-blowing and then the lead vocalist she is something else she goes

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:57.120
from high to growls that you can't imagine um is possible um i've really been digging i've been

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:01.520
digging them quite a lot and then i learned they're from ukraine as well and so i've been

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:07.840
following them throughout the war and i'm thankful that they are all okay and safe and all that kind

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.680
of stuff but they've been sharing some stuff on their youtube channel so i've i've really

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:16.640
gotten into them i have to say and there's like another band that's kind of similar called spirit

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:24.800
box it's also a female um lead that also goes from melodic to full-on growl and again the

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:32.960
musicianship is just amazing um and some uh instrumental stuff like um animals as leaders

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:39.920
some of these people that play these eight string oh yeah electric guitars it's just like mother

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:45.280
it's so impressive and yeah yeah so a bunch of like stuff like that i've been getting really into but

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:51.040
then i've been getting back into some old good old things like in tombs blander stein album

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:57.440
um and some of the old sepultura and stuff like that just the rhythmic stuff and that just gets

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:04.240
me every time i'm a sucker for a good rhythm oh big time yeah no that's absolutely fantastic

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:10.000
now i mean i i've got uh sepultura's beneath the remains album on vinyl i put that on the other

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.240
day like sometimes i haven't listened to it for a while but it's a it's a super super brilliant

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.800
you know anybody that likes thrash it's just a brilliant album it's really more kind of thrash

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:24.480
death but it's it's it's it's absolutely superb um if you're it sounds like you're getting quite

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.360
into a bunch of kind of you know interesting female-fronted metal bands and i i also really

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.360
like ginger i think they're really really impressive really really good stuff but

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:39.280
there's a there's a uk band called rolo tamasi who are also like a a metal band

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:46.000
but with a female vocalist and she also does like really good melodic singy stuff as well as

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:53.040
growling uh they're really great they they also go into a lot of really weird disturbingly strange

01:07:53.040 --> 01:08:00.400
kind of sort of techie screamo prog crazy stuff yeah they're they're they're really really great

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:07.760
yeah i'll definitely check them out so in closing what are your hopes for the future

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:15.120
and now from two perspectives one for tech and then on a more philosophical perspective

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:24.880
for the world crikey that is a big question um i think i could probably sum it up in four

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:31.840
in in six words um better climate less war less fascism

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.080
you know we could we could get into that a bit more i'm a i'm i'm very much

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:44.480
quite seriously committed to environmentalism so my my wife and i have done quite a bit of activism

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:54.320
with various groups um not just stop oil but we did do a bunch of stuff with extinction rebellion

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.400
we've been to quite a lot of protests and done quite a lot of activism activity with them

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.160
for me that's the key to everything really is the whole environmental

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:11.280
catastrophe that the world is facing because you know if we don't have a planet to live on anymore

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:15.920
everything else we could possibly discuss is just completely and utterly null and void there's not

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:23.360
even really it's not really worth talking about um yeah of course one big issue with that i you

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:30.160
know i can say that but at the same time another problem that you tend to get is that a lot of

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.480
the issues affecting tackling the climate catastrophe so climate change denial all of

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:46.400
that kind of stuff tends to be um tends to be connected to uh fascism as well unfortunately

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:51.760
there's a lot of fascist politicians out there that really really don't care about environmental

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:58.480
issues they think it's all a hoax they think it's all a load of rubbish made up by woke lefties like

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.880
me to try and steal a piece of their pie um but really that just goes into the whole selfish

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:11.920
outlook that those folks unfortunately often tend to harbor um yeah so yeah uh that's that's one

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:21.200
great big hairy deal and of course that also tends to create injustice and it tends to create um

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.920
people getting at loggerheads of each other which of course somewhere further down the line leads

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:34.000
to war so really these things are all interconnected um but yeah i'm just really really hoping that we

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.760
can get a bunch more people thinking about doing things to help the climate catastrophe you know

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:48.240
it seems clear to me that the governments of this world again like we talked like something

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.320
similar to what we mentioned earlier they like to talk a lot about this but they don't seem to

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:59.440
really like to do very much about it um yeah yeah so i think what we need is for everybody to start

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.680
uh helping out with the environmental catastrophe just by doing small things and helping out doing

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.280
anything they can yeah i would agree and i think one of the key things is i i heard about this

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:16.960
thing that they've they've learned and i think it's in taiwan where they've done some research and

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:23.440
so to drown out negativity for each one negative you have to have 10 positive so i think

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:33.600
i think we need to as a as a species as the human race we need to drown out this because i do think

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:40.160
it's a vocal minority and i've been in so many circumstances where you think that oh so many

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.600
people are against this thing or for this other thing but then when you really dig into it you

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:52.560
find out no it's actually a very vocal minority and if all the rest of the people stop standing

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:58.960
by and just looking at it and start speaking up just it we can drown them out very quickly

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:05.680
and i think a lot of people are not really aware of the fact that this is no small thing it's

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.880
nothing else is important if we don't have a place to live

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:16.320
essentially so this this should be like the way the people that that everybody in the world came

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:25.680
together to battle covid we need that for climate change climate crisis yep absolutely agree man

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.360
well thanks so much chris this was wonderful um i was looking forward to this conversation i'm

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.200
glad we could make it happen even though i'm it's low cheating over here and uh it's late

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.920
in the evening for both of us but um i'm really grateful that you made some time to speak with me

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.000
and i wish you all the best with millstocks i know it's going to be a huge success and i

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:55.360
look forward to to seeing the business grow well cheers man thanks for having me it's uh it's been
