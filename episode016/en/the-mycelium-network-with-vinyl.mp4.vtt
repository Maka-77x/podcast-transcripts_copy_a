Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.680 --> 00:09.600
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.600
Hey, Vinyl.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.520
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.680
Thanks so much for joining me.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.560
Thank you very much for having me.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.240
It's a pleasure.

00:19.240 --> 00:23.960
So in the past, I'm learning podcasting as I make these.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.400
I think it's kind of like how code works, right?

00:26.400 --> 00:29.280
You learn it as you make things.

00:29.280 --> 00:34.200
And so in the beginning, I used to always kind of read people's bio out.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.960
And I thought, nah, that's so been done a million times.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.080
I want to do something else.

00:38.080 --> 00:44.300
So what I basically want to do is keep quiet and let you talk.

00:44.300 --> 00:48.200
So you can go as far back as you want.

00:48.200 --> 00:53.520
But basically tell us about your story, like who is Vinyl and how did you get to where

00:53.520 --> 00:54.520
you are today?

00:54.520 --> 00:55.520
Where are you today?

00:55.520 --> 01:01.000
And maybe even some things that you are looking forward to in the future?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah, certainly.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.760
Oh, gosh, where to start, though?

01:05.760 --> 01:08.200
Well, I guess I'll start with my name.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.800
Hi, my name is Vinyl Daigu.

01:10.800 --> 01:20.720
I am a web developer and web documentation writer for MDN Web Docs as well as Open Web

01:20.720 --> 01:21.720
Docs.

01:21.720 --> 01:27.880
Fun fact, I actually started off with a multimedia background not a lot of people know.

01:27.880 --> 01:34.360
Actually never really got my coding experience from college or any traditional education.

01:34.360 --> 01:41.880
It was mostly just me playing around my own time with a wonderful private coding tutor.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.680
And well, here I am now.

01:45.680 --> 01:56.760
So my background started with doing mostly After Effects type stuff, so film color grading,

01:56.760 --> 02:00.560
doing animation for big film industries and stuff.

02:00.560 --> 02:07.940
Not like 3D, more of the 2D visual effects, like adding particles to some sort of wizardry

02:07.940 --> 02:10.480
show or something like that.

02:10.480 --> 02:17.960
Also started with doing music as well, like writing soundtracks and orchestral type stuff.

02:17.960 --> 02:18.960
Oh, wow.

02:18.960 --> 02:19.960
That is amazing.

02:19.960 --> 02:20.960
Thank you.

02:20.960 --> 02:21.960
Is any of that stuff available online?

02:21.960 --> 02:29.440
Yeah, I've got all of the music that I have written is available on my SoundCloud at soundcloud.com

02:29.440 --> 02:31.840
slash Queen Guborg.

02:31.840 --> 02:38.080
It is also available on my YouTube, including my animation works at youtube.com slash Queen

02:38.080 --> 02:43.480
Guborg, or you can search up my name, Vinyl Daigyu Kazutetsu, and you will find me.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.480
Oh, awesome.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.480
I'll share these links.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.920
I'm really curious about this.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.400
I'd love to listen to it.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.840
So talking about that, you do have a very unique name.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.180
Like I said, it kind of makes me think of artists like Grimes and people like that.

02:56.180 --> 02:57.960
What is the story behind the name?

02:57.960 --> 03:04.160
So the first part about it, the vinyl part, mostly comes from the musical experience,

03:04.160 --> 03:06.120
as I mentioned.

03:06.120 --> 03:12.520
Most people think that I'm referring to me being like a disc jockey or a DJ, but that's

03:12.520 --> 03:15.680
not really the same thing as somebody that writes music.

03:15.680 --> 03:20.160
A DJ is somebody that's mixing existing songs together.

03:20.160 --> 03:25.280
But I thought about it and the name kind of stuck, so I'm like, eh, vinyl, let's keep

03:25.280 --> 03:26.280
it.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.280
That's a very cool name.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.280
I really like it.

03:28.280 --> 03:32.800
In preparation for the conversation, I dug through some of your tweets, and I looked

03:32.800 --> 03:37.160
at some of the websites that you've made and the things you've written, and we've worked

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
together.

03:38.160 --> 03:44.400
Truth be told, we work together almost on a daily basis on MDN and related projects.

03:44.400 --> 03:49.760
So I also know some things about how you work and the things you do through that, and there's

03:49.760 --> 03:52.280
some stuff there that I'd like to ask you about a bit later on.

03:52.280 --> 03:57.240
But before we get to that, I saw a retweet of yours that kind of struck me as well, and

03:57.240 --> 04:00.520
I know you retweeted it because it struck a chord with you as well.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.600
The tweet features a graphic, and there's these words that say, the reason why some

04:04.600 --> 04:09.960
people are so kind is because the world has been so unkind to them, that they don't want

04:09.960 --> 04:14.160
other people to feel the way they did.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.800
And for me, I do wish there was more kindness in the world.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.440
And I think in the last two, three years, everything that's happened in the world and

04:21.440 --> 04:28.880
continues to happen, there's a feeling of cynicism that is set into a lot of people.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.680
And it's sad.

04:30.680 --> 04:31.680
It's hard.

04:31.680 --> 04:36.960
I mean, I sometimes go through that myself, which I guess is human, but sometimes more

04:36.960 --> 04:46.200
than I'd like, to always try to find something to make me not give up, essentially.

04:46.200 --> 04:55.680
But I'd like to hear why that phrase, why that tweet had an impact on you.

04:55.680 --> 05:05.920
It definitely struck a chord with me, that particular image, and going through the...

05:05.920 --> 05:12.360
I guess trying to do so many different things, as I have done in the past with the music,

05:12.360 --> 05:16.840
the animation, trying to get my fingers into so many different things, I've learned all

05:16.840 --> 05:22.920
about these different communities, how they work, how they operate, the good, and unfortunately,

05:22.920 --> 05:23.920
the bad as well.

05:23.920 --> 05:29.640
And I've had a lot of negative experiences in the past with others who have different

05:29.640 --> 05:36.400
ideas, different mindsets, and quite frankly, different ideas about how to behave towards

05:36.400 --> 05:38.200
others as well.

05:38.200 --> 05:44.040
I've been the center of a lot of hate for many different things, one, being a furry,

05:44.040 --> 05:51.920
two, being transgender, three, just for having my own ideas.

05:51.920 --> 05:57.740
So I want to be one of those individuals in the world that is not like that.

05:57.740 --> 06:03.440
I want to be one of the good souls in this world, because I believe that the more that

06:03.440 --> 06:09.960
we give to help others, the more good we will receive ourselves, and the better the world

06:09.960 --> 06:10.960
will be.

06:10.960 --> 06:11.960
Yeah.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.560
And you're doing a good job at that, by the way.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.800
I can acknowledge that for one, having worked with you closely.

06:19.800 --> 06:27.960
So going down the same path and getting a bit more specific maybe, maybe a bit broader,

06:27.960 --> 06:33.880
I think we can all acknowledge that there are problems in the tech industry.

06:33.880 --> 06:39.040
Some have gotten better, but it's also maybe not entirely unique to the tech industry.

06:39.040 --> 06:45.400
Maybe it's more of just the way we work problem, but I personally can only speak to what I've

06:45.400 --> 06:50.560
experienced, so that is tech, and that is kind of the topic of the podcast and the audience.

06:50.560 --> 06:55.520
So why do you see as some of the biggest problems in technology, and do you feel free to be

06:55.520 --> 06:58.480
as broad or narrow as you want?

06:58.480 --> 07:05.320
I think probably one of the biggest issues that I face on a daily basis is educating

07:05.320 --> 07:11.840
those to what is available out there for them in terms of technology.

07:11.840 --> 07:18.960
One of the things I do on the side is computer repair, and as a part of that, a lot of my

07:18.960 --> 07:24.600
job ends up being teaching others how to use their computer in the first place, or what

07:24.600 --> 07:30.840
the difference between Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge is, or heck, even the difference between

07:30.840 --> 07:33.400
left and right mouse click.

07:33.400 --> 07:42.040
I think that there needs to be more programs out there to teach individuals how to use

07:42.040 --> 07:48.600
a computer, what a computer is, how it works, also how to avoid scams that are on the computer,

07:48.600 --> 07:53.400
because the people that don't know how to use a computer as much are the ones that get

07:53.400 --> 07:57.640
targeted the most, because they don't understand these differences, and I think it would be

07:57.640 --> 08:05.440
pretty great to see some more government-funded programs and stuff to educate their citizens

08:05.440 --> 08:12.600
on the 21st century, basically.

08:12.600 --> 08:19.760
It's kind of strange that if you think about it from a narrow perspective, like somebody

08:19.760 --> 08:25.560
that's in the tech industry, you completely forget about the fact that there are a lot

08:25.560 --> 08:31.040
of people that don't know how to use the basic things about a computer.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.680
One often hears that if you ask somebody, like, what is the internet, they'll tell

08:35.680 --> 08:41.920
you Facebook, or they'll tell you Google, and that's their concept, that's their understanding

08:41.920 --> 08:43.360
of what the internet is.

08:43.360 --> 08:49.680
They don't understand that there's so much more to it than just those two service providers

08:49.680 --> 08:55.280
or big corporate companies, and then of course, just like you said, the very, very basics

08:55.280 --> 08:59.280
of, okay, I keep my computers on, now what do I do with this thing?

08:59.280 --> 09:01.680
A lot of people don't know.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.480
I think with early-stage web developers, that is the same thing.

09:06.480 --> 09:10.800
I think once you get to a certain point, you can kind of figure stuff out yourself, and

09:10.800 --> 09:15.000
you kind of get to know where to find the answers that you're looking for.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.600
But if you're completely new, I'm not sure we're doing a really good job there of onboarding

09:21.600 --> 09:22.600
folks.

09:22.600 --> 09:30.320
I agree with that, and it's quite a challenge to figure out how to write these guides for

09:30.320 --> 09:37.400
these beginners as well, because us being so experienced with technology and the different

09:37.400 --> 09:42.320
technologies that are available to us, like being an expert in the field, there are things

09:42.320 --> 09:50.600
that we just know instinctively at this point, and we kind of forget what people need to

09:50.600 --> 09:58.320
be taught in that same sense, what they need to learn before they get to the more advanced

09:58.320 --> 09:59.320
levels.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.320
Yeah, for sure.

10:00.320 --> 10:07.480
Like the Massey network, part of, well, I guess the core function or the core reason

10:07.480 --> 10:14.360
that exists is basically to try and solve this by talking to exactly those people and

10:14.360 --> 10:16.800
asking them, like, what are your pain points?

10:16.800 --> 10:17.800
Why?

10:17.800 --> 10:20.380
Where do you get frustrated?

10:20.380 --> 10:23.880
And so it's not just understanding why you're getting into tech, but okay, now that you're

10:23.880 --> 10:27.000
trying to get into it, what is the roadblocks you're facing?

10:27.000 --> 10:31.280
And oftentimes you think it might be stuff like work experience, and that is definitely

10:31.280 --> 10:36.760
a problem, or like interviews, or how do I find a job?

10:36.760 --> 10:43.160
But oftentimes it's more like, no, it's not that, it's, I don't know where to begin, or

10:43.160 --> 10:48.080
I've started, but now I'm kind of stuck at this point and there's so much information

10:48.080 --> 10:51.080
and I don't know where to go from here.

10:51.080 --> 10:56.480
And I kind of end up spinning my wheels and getting a bit demotivated.

10:56.480 --> 11:01.160
So yeah, I do think there's room here for curation.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.280
That is what I've learned.

11:03.280 --> 11:06.400
Not so much creating new content necessarily.

11:06.400 --> 11:12.160
I think places like MDN and that do a great job of it, but the curation is maybe with

11:12.160 --> 11:13.160
the missing piece.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.160
I agree.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.680
So staying with tweets, another one that caught my eyes is this meme that you tweeted where

11:18.680 --> 11:24.480
you said like, when explaining to non-developers what you do, this is like a meme that you

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
use.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.560
I found that very interesting.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.760
Can you maybe, seeing this as a podcast, people can't see the visual, I'll link to it, of

11:30.760 --> 11:36.960
course, but can you maybe explain the tweet a little bit and like how you use that to

11:36.960 --> 11:40.200
explain to people what it is you do?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.920
Yeah, certainly.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.920
So I always had thought about the big brain, bigger brain, biggest brain meme that you're

11:46.920 --> 11:48.640
referring to.

11:48.640 --> 11:56.840
And a lot of times in the past when I tried to explain what I do to others, they wouldn't

11:56.840 --> 12:05.480
really understand the difference between doing the web development itself versus documenting

12:05.480 --> 12:12.220
how to write websites and what are the technologies available in these browsers.

12:12.220 --> 12:20.520
So I always like referred to that meme whenever I would talk about it and say like, it is

12:20.520 --> 12:27.480
web development related, but what we are doing here at MDN Web Docs is a step beyond that

12:27.480 --> 12:33.280
because we are teaching others how to write websites, not necessarily writing our own

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
websites.

12:34.280 --> 12:39.960
And I mean, I do do web development still, like I have my own personal website, I have

12:39.960 --> 12:46.200
the one for my company, I do contract web development for other companies as well.

12:46.200 --> 12:53.440
But when it comes to what I am contracted to do for MDN Web Docs and Open Web Docs,

12:53.440 --> 13:00.040
it's not really much to do with the web development itself, more so the teaching others how to

13:00.040 --> 13:01.040
do it.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.040
Okay, that's cool.

13:02.040 --> 13:07.000
Yeah, I think that that is that could be a tricky subject to explain and to really get

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
across.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.880
But I think you did a good job of doing that just now.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.800
So thank you.

13:12.800 --> 13:19.200
I still have one one of my family members still thinks that when I say browser compatibility

13:19.200 --> 13:26.900
data, and I'm talking about the MDN BCD project, they still think to this day, that I am referring

13:26.900 --> 13:34.240
to writing cross browser compatible websites, and every single time I have to explain, no,

13:34.240 --> 13:41.120
I'm documenting what web browsers support what features so others are able to do that.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
Yeah.

13:42.120 --> 13:47.280
So I had this question phrased a little differently in the doc, but now having talked, I'm thinking

13:47.280 --> 13:49.320
about the phrase a little different.

13:49.320 --> 13:54.560
You've mentioned that, that, like, you didn't do the traditional like on ramp to getting

13:54.560 --> 14:04.000
into tech and you come from like a music slash art slash animation background, which I mean,

14:04.000 --> 14:09.280
if I had a penny for the number of people who've come to take from musicianship, I'd

14:09.280 --> 14:11.600
be a very rich man at this point.

14:11.600 --> 14:18.200
Because I myself was a classical guitarist before I got into tech.

14:18.200 --> 14:23.880
But at some point, you decided that, you know what, I think I'm going to switch to software

14:23.880 --> 14:29.680
documentation as a career, which is also interesting because not directly web development necessary

14:29.680 --> 14:34.040
as a career, but documenting the web as you just explained.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.560
What was it about this stuff?

14:35.560 --> 14:36.640
Why documentation?

14:36.640 --> 14:42.600
Why did that get you really excited and make you change careers?

14:42.600 --> 14:50.040
So I think one of the biggest things, it's kind of in different stages, if I had to say.

14:50.040 --> 14:56.960
The first stage was attempting to pursue a traditional education for music production

14:56.960 --> 15:00.040
and music composition and stuff.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.320
I took college courses for it.

15:03.320 --> 15:07.200
Honestly speaking, I think that was one of the biggest mistakes that I have made in my

15:07.200 --> 15:14.000
life, particularly because I don't know if other colleges do this, but for the one that

15:14.000 --> 15:21.640
I was doing and the classes that I was attending, they were pushing more for quantity and really

15:21.640 --> 15:27.520
trying to push you to write song after song after song after song.

15:27.520 --> 15:32.680
That led to pretty much burning me out permanently.

15:32.680 --> 15:40.120
I was putting so many ideas down in such a short amount of time, it was like two months,

15:40.120 --> 15:45.160
three months, and I had written maybe 20, maybe 30 different pieces.

15:45.160 --> 15:51.120
At that point, I was just burnt out and I couldn't think about any other ideas for my

15:51.120 --> 15:55.200
own projects, for anyone else's projects.

15:55.200 --> 16:02.320
So after that, I kind of put that to halt and started focusing more on the animation

16:02.320 --> 16:10.160
side of things, so the music visualizers, the light shows type stuff.

16:10.160 --> 16:17.520
That was pretty fun, but I was quickly getting frustrated with my computer crashing a bunch

16:17.520 --> 16:23.200
on me and the software crashing and taking so long to render because I was doing all

16:23.200 --> 16:28.840
this complicated stuff, the computer was like, whoa, there, I got to process this.

16:28.840 --> 16:36.360
Really considering the fact I was rendering out 4K videos and 4K at 60 frames a second

16:36.360 --> 16:38.720
before anybody else on YouTube did.

16:38.720 --> 16:44.520
Most people were still doing the standard full HD 1080p at 30 frames a second.

16:44.520 --> 16:50.760
Me, I wanted to get a head start on the future of videos and stuff, especially because I

16:50.760 --> 16:57.360
noticed that rendering it out in 4K, there's a lot more information for the computer to

16:57.360 --> 17:02.920
downscale to 1080p and the images would look a lot crisper, they'd look a lot smoother

17:02.920 --> 17:05.760
and stuff.

17:05.760 --> 17:13.040
But after a while, I was doing that and I was doing the visualizers for a EDM promotional

17:13.040 --> 17:19.800
channel on YouTube, which that was going pretty good for quite some time.

17:19.800 --> 17:26.420
But unfortunately, as I started to get more and more of a bigger role in that, turns out

17:26.420 --> 17:36.200
my interests in music don't really align with the majority of EDM listeners' preferences,

17:36.200 --> 17:43.280
so it ended up causing the channel to lose subscriptions and stuff and then people started

17:43.280 --> 17:47.440
hating me for that and eventually I was like, okay, you know what?

17:47.440 --> 17:53.620
I give up on this, I'm done, I'm gonna go ahead and move on to something that's probably

17:53.620 --> 17:56.840
a little bad for my skillset.

17:56.840 --> 18:02.160
So I was looking around for software development stuff, for web development things.

18:02.160 --> 18:09.340
I stumbled across the BCD project and saw that I was looking for some help, so I started

18:09.340 --> 18:12.960
to do some pull requests for it, really get into that.

18:12.960 --> 18:19.280
Eventually I started enjoying it more and more until that became like my full-time project,

18:19.280 --> 18:23.080
like I was working on that almost 24-7.

18:23.080 --> 18:32.320
In the end, I grew in a heavy appreciation for documenting the World Wide Web and creating

18:32.320 --> 18:39.760
resources for others to learn upon, and something clicked in me at that time.

18:39.760 --> 18:46.800
I thought, hey, this is really awesome, being able to provide resources for others to improve

18:46.800 --> 18:47.800
their stuff.

18:47.800 --> 18:52.480
This is really amazing and a wonderful goal and I want to be a part of that.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.200
I want to help improve the world for the better.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.680
Yeah, those are all great missions to have.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.440
I share the same thing, that's for sure.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.520
So that is super interesting.

19:06.520 --> 19:16.600
So how do you counteract or try and prevent burnout in this new career?

19:16.600 --> 19:24.880
The reason I asked that is because working with you, you're super productive.

19:24.880 --> 19:29.760
You get things done really fast and really well.

19:29.760 --> 19:35.680
So is this just pure enthusiasm, or do you have specific techniques you can share with

19:35.680 --> 19:36.680
everybody?

19:36.680 --> 19:41.400
And then how do you ensure that you don't burn out in this new career?

19:41.400 --> 19:43.680
First of all, it means a lot to me to hear those words.

19:43.680 --> 19:47.320
I really appreciate hearing that.

19:47.320 --> 19:54.520
I would say probably one of the most helpful things is not just working on a single project

19:54.520 --> 19:56.040
all the time.

19:56.040 --> 20:01.000
Because if you're doing the exact same thing over and over and over again, eventually it's

20:01.000 --> 20:04.280
going to wear you out, you're going to get tired of it, you're going to get sick of it,

20:04.280 --> 20:08.160
and if you continue, you're eventually going to get completely burnt out.

20:08.160 --> 20:13.120
So for me, what I do is I switch between different projects a lot.

20:13.120 --> 20:19.160
I'm still sticking with mostly the projects within the MDN Web Docs repositories and stuff,

20:19.160 --> 20:25.360
but I'm working on the BCD project, I'm working on some content eventually, then I'm working

20:25.360 --> 20:32.800
on the core engine for MDN Web Docs, and then I'm working on one of the aspects for the

20:32.800 --> 20:37.360
interactive examples that you see, and then switching back and forth between them, then

20:37.360 --> 20:41.520
spending some time on my own personal projects like my company website.

20:41.520 --> 20:48.640
So I think probably the most helpful thing is not sticking to just one thing at a time,

20:48.640 --> 20:53.560
but switching between them and trying different things.

20:53.560 --> 21:01.640
So that way you're always switching to something new, something fresh, and keeping the cycle

21:01.640 --> 21:02.640
of fresh content.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.120
Yeah, makes sense.

21:04.120 --> 21:12.040
I also think that's one of the reasons I like the idea of open source.

21:12.040 --> 21:18.720
One of many is this freedom to move between projects and also your own stuff, scratching

21:18.720 --> 21:21.440
your own itch and all that.

21:21.440 --> 21:27.600
Because I did do the corporate thing in the beginning of my career, and that was not a

21:27.600 --> 21:30.440
good fit for me at all.

21:30.440 --> 21:39.360
Getting up every day to build some back-end administrative console for some big mobile

21:39.360 --> 21:45.720
company was just like, there's nothing here that means anything to me.

21:45.720 --> 21:53.160
And then the working environment, like the company culture, was not great, so that doesn't

21:53.160 --> 21:54.160
help.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.320
You don't even have the people that you stay for.

21:56.320 --> 22:01.800
So yeah, when I got into open source and when I started contracting with Mozilla about 11

22:01.800 --> 22:11.560
years ago, I saw a whole new world for sure, and I can't see myself moving out of that

22:11.560 --> 22:14.720
world ever, ever again.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
So I get that.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.280
I think of what they say, variety is the spice of life.

22:18.280 --> 22:24.920
So I guess it's very true when it comes to coding as well and preventing burnout.

22:24.920 --> 22:31.440
So that leads me to one question, and I'm going to push that one down the road a little

22:31.440 --> 22:34.560
bit and just step back a little.

22:34.560 --> 22:39.560
You gave some advice that I think is very good, where it's like, don't spend all your

22:39.560 --> 22:43.560
time on a single thing, try different things because that keeps things interesting.

22:43.560 --> 22:50.040
But beyond that, is there any advice you can share for early-stage web developers that's

22:50.040 --> 22:51.040
starting their journey?

22:51.040 --> 22:58.280
In this, to be honest, fast-paced industry, I'm sorry, I'm going a little bit over the

22:58.280 --> 23:01.960
place with my brain keeps thinking things that you said that I wanted to get back to.

23:01.960 --> 23:06.120
Because the stuff that you talked about with the music industry, I think that industry

23:06.120 --> 23:08.260
is rough.

23:08.260 --> 23:12.960
I think it's very, very, very demanding.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.920
And I think it's because it's become like a kind of sausage factory.

23:15.920 --> 23:21.680
It just has to keep pumping out more and more and more, and the faster the better, the more

23:21.680 --> 23:24.440
money there is to do.

23:24.440 --> 23:29.520
And I think that's one of the things I like more about open source versus corporate environments,

23:29.520 --> 23:34.960
is that because there's more meaning to the work, I think people take a little bit more

23:34.960 --> 23:40.880
time to consider how they do things and whether they should do things.

23:40.880 --> 23:47.760
But yeah, coming back to what I wanted to ask you is, what advice do you have for early-stage

23:47.760 --> 23:50.720
web developers that's just getting into this industry?

23:50.720 --> 23:53.800
That's a really good question.

23:53.800 --> 24:00.080
I would have to say one of the most impactful statements of advice that I would give to

24:00.080 --> 24:05.560
an early web developer is don't give up.

24:05.560 --> 24:11.280
As an early programmer, as an early software developer or web developer, you're going to

24:11.280 --> 24:14.240
run into issues left and right.

24:14.240 --> 24:18.160
There's always going to be some problem that's going to arise and you're going to have to

24:18.160 --> 24:20.200
solve it.

24:20.200 --> 24:28.720
I believe that failure is not the end, but rather a path to success and a learning experience.

24:28.720 --> 24:36.680
So if something's got you stumped, don't give up, maybe take a step back for a little

24:36.680 --> 24:39.360
bit and then come back to it with fresh eyes.

24:39.360 --> 24:44.600
Or if you're really stumped, there's so many great resources online, like Stack Overflow,

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
for example.

24:45.600 --> 24:50.120
You can ask basically any software development question and there are so many people who

24:50.120 --> 24:54.080
will jump right onto the question and answer it for you.

24:54.080 --> 24:59.120
Or most likely, if you're having an issue, your question has already been answered and

24:59.120 --> 25:06.640
there are existing Stack Overflow or Reddit posts that answer the question with so many

25:06.640 --> 25:11.840
different users giving really wonderful advice on those platforms.

25:11.840 --> 25:18.040
So don't get discouraged, don't give up, keep pushing forward and you will reach your

25:18.040 --> 25:19.040
goals eventually.

25:19.040 --> 25:24.520
So interesting you mentioned Reddit, I'm slowly using it again.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.080
How do you find Reddit as a platform?

25:26.080 --> 25:32.440
Do you find it like being inviting and good for tech in general, but then also maybe new

25:32.440 --> 25:33.920
folks?

25:33.920 --> 25:38.520
I would say it depends on which communities on Reddit you go to.

25:38.520 --> 25:44.600
There are some pretty amazing communities that are on Reddit that are actually really

25:44.600 --> 25:47.200
inviting and welcoming.

25:47.200 --> 25:54.160
And then there's the ones that are kind of like, oh, you're a person, well, screw you,

25:54.160 --> 26:00.360
you're a crap stain on society.

26:00.360 --> 26:08.360
I think just like anywhere on the internet, I would say, it depends on where you go.

26:08.360 --> 26:13.840
There are going to be the bad apples out there, but there's also a lot of good apples if you

26:13.840 --> 26:14.840
look in the right places.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.200
Yeah, do you have any subreddits that you can recommend?

26:18.200 --> 26:25.800
That's a good question, r slash JavaScript, I guess, would be one.

26:25.800 --> 26:31.080
I don't really go on Reddit that much myself, but most of the time that I go on Reddit is

26:31.080 --> 26:35.720
when I'm Google searching something and that's what comes up in the Google search results.

26:35.720 --> 26:40.720
Yeah, it shows you how different our search results are tailored based on our usage, because

26:40.720 --> 26:44.360
I always never get Reddit in my search results when I search for stuff.

26:44.360 --> 26:51.600
So I think r slash Python, so yeah, r slash Python.

26:51.600 --> 26:56.960
Hot topic, like or dislike TypeScript and how early do you think web developer should start

26:56.960 --> 26:58.480
paying attention to it?

26:58.480 --> 27:02.080
Oh, this is a definitely a hot take.

27:02.080 --> 27:07.040
I personally despise JavaScript, not JavaScript.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.200
I personally despise TypeScript.

27:09.200 --> 27:17.040
I like the concept behind it of having type checking for all of your variables to make

27:17.040 --> 27:23.320
sure that you're sending nothing but exactly the types of inputs that you want and preparing

27:23.320 --> 27:24.320
for those.

27:24.320 --> 27:32.360
However, I think that there is a lot with TypeScript that really needs to be overhauled

27:32.360 --> 27:41.320
and fixed and seeing the development stages for TypeScript or really any of the Microsoft

27:41.320 --> 27:45.840
owned projects, I highly doubt that they're ever really going to get fixed.

27:45.840 --> 27:53.280
What I would personally like to see is a TypeScript alternative, like a new project that introduces

27:53.280 --> 27:59.360
the same things that TypeScript does, but in a much better developer friendly way.

27:59.360 --> 28:04.000
Yeah, so I don't know if I dreamt this or if this is a thing, but I've mentioned it

28:04.000 --> 28:05.440
to somebody else as well.

28:05.440 --> 28:10.400
I heard that Microsoft made a proposal to bring types to JavaScript.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.920
Does that ring a bell?

28:12.920 --> 28:17.720
I have not heard about this.

28:17.720 --> 28:21.760
The tricky thing, of course, with anything you want to do to JavaScript is you have to

28:21.760 --> 28:23.820
always make sure it's backwards compatible.

28:23.820 --> 28:30.120
You can't just turn JavaScript into a typed language because 90% of the internet will

28:30.120 --> 28:32.800
break.

28:32.800 --> 28:40.520
I don't know if they want to do this in the form of annotations or exactly what, and maybe

28:40.520 --> 28:44.360
this is something I thought I heard and I didn't, but I'm pretty sure that there was

28:44.360 --> 28:52.080
this talk that Microsoft has proposed this to TC39 and that it's in discussion about

28:52.080 --> 28:55.200
whether that's a good idea.

28:55.200 --> 29:02.740
I spoke to somebody earlier today and it'll have to be really well thought out.

29:02.740 --> 29:07.080
Maybe this is the opportunity that you're mentioning to rethink how it's done and do

29:07.080 --> 29:10.160
it better.

29:10.160 --> 29:19.240
I do worry about if this would present a barrier to people new to the web because currently

29:19.240 --> 29:25.320
while making a website isn't the most complicated thing, it's not easy either, especially if

29:25.320 --> 29:27.800
you want to do it well.

29:27.800 --> 29:33.680
I think all the technologies are really approachable and you can get quite far even if you don't

29:33.680 --> 29:36.320
know all the ins and outs of it.

29:36.320 --> 29:45.760
I don't know if bringing typing to JavaScript would cause a bigger barrier to entry.

29:45.760 --> 29:55.360
I see that there is a Microsoft dev blog post about this proposal from March 9th and what

29:55.360 --> 30:02.320
I'm seeing here, if I'm reading this correctly, is that it would be bringing type definitions

30:02.320 --> 30:08.800
to JavaScript but not necessarily require the type definitions.

30:08.800 --> 30:14.800
If that's the case, then I would be for this because I think that one of the biggest barriers

30:14.800 --> 30:20.520
with TypeScript itself is the fact that you have to go all or nothing with TypeScript.

30:20.520 --> 30:28.560
You either do all type checking or you don't bother with TypeScript at all.

30:28.560 --> 30:35.560
If JavaScript is kept backwards compatible in this sense where you can specify types

30:35.560 --> 30:42.000
as you desire rather than having to specify all of the different types, then I think that

30:42.000 --> 30:48.240
this proposal would actually be pretty helpful for the future of the World Wide Web.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.240
That's cool.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.720
That's an interesting take.

30:50.720 --> 30:57.640
Like I said, I think maybe this is that opportunity where they can do it, they can improve and

30:57.640 --> 31:04.060
take all the learnings that they've had with TypeScript because I have a love-age relationship

31:04.060 --> 31:05.720
with it.

31:05.720 --> 31:12.400
When you don't have to fight it, it's super useful, but I do find that oftentimes I feel

31:12.400 --> 31:19.920
like I could have done something much, much faster if I didn't have to fight TypeScript.

31:19.920 --> 31:24.520
That is especially true when it comes to DOM elements.

31:24.520 --> 31:28.320
TypeScript don't seem to play very well with these things.

31:28.320 --> 31:32.120
If you have an event and it's like it could be a button but it could also have come from

31:32.120 --> 31:36.680
a link or it could have come from this, then typing starts to get pretty tricky.

31:36.680 --> 31:41.760
Sometimes it throws up the weirdest errors about stuff like, oh, this thing could potentially

31:41.760 --> 31:48.560
be null, but it's like, yeah, I guess, but I know that it never will be or this piece

31:48.560 --> 31:54.360
of code wouldn't have run at all.

31:54.360 --> 31:57.920
I definitely have a love-age relationship with it.

31:57.920 --> 32:03.000
My personal opinion around that always has been I can see the value of it when you're

32:03.000 --> 32:04.600
writing an API.

32:04.600 --> 32:10.280
I'm not so sold on it when you just use it for good old front-end development.

32:10.280 --> 32:13.840
I'm not sure how much value it adds there.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.840
I agree.

32:14.840 --> 32:19.520
This was the exact same response that I had given to one of my old contracts when they

32:19.520 --> 32:25.080
had asked if they should migrate over to TypeScript for their front-end.

32:25.080 --> 32:30.600
They were asking me what I thought the upsides and downsides would be for it.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.720
My response was pretty much exactly the same.

32:33.720 --> 32:37.280
There's no real reason to migrate your front-end to TypeScript.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.040
The back-end, yeah, totally.

32:40.040 --> 32:44.500
It actually does provide some benefits for the back-end, but the front-end, just leave

32:44.500 --> 32:45.760
it as pure JavaScript.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.760
Yeah.

32:46.760 --> 32:50.960
I think we're talking the same language there for sure.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.960
You've alluded to this before, but I want to bring it up.

32:54.960 --> 33:00.080
You are the founder of Guborg Studios, and when I looked into it a little more, I learned

33:00.080 --> 33:05.400
about Gufont and GooIcons, and the GooIcons are really cool.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.140
I really like them a lot.

33:07.140 --> 33:13.720
Can you tell us a little bit more about Guborg Studios and then these other two tangentially

33:13.720 --> 33:15.200
related projects?

33:15.200 --> 33:17.000
Yeah, certainly.

33:17.000 --> 33:25.040
Guborg Studios had basically been my dream company for probably over a decade, maybe

33:25.040 --> 33:32.140
a decade and a half, and I wanted to create this company that brings a bunch of different

33:32.140 --> 33:39.800
kinds of artists, software developers, translators, et cetera, together under one roof so that

33:39.800 --> 33:42.800
we can create these amazing projects together.

33:42.800 --> 33:51.400
It actually started off as an idea for this one anime series that I wanted to do, which

33:51.400 --> 33:57.320
later turned into the idea for a video game, which later turned into, well, just sitting

33:57.320 --> 34:00.160
on my old MacBook back at home.

34:00.160 --> 34:05.600
I really like that idea, because I myself am building a company, and the thing that

34:05.600 --> 34:12.400
I didn't want it to be is yet another agency, and it's by some way or shape or form, it's

34:12.400 --> 34:17.480
going to turn into that, and I'm not happy with it, and I want to now reevaluate everything

34:17.480 --> 34:24.280
and change the direction, but I really like the idea of this multi-disciplinary kind of

34:24.280 --> 34:30.440
approach where you're doing all these different creative things and you bring it together,

34:30.440 --> 34:33.680
because I can just imagine the amazing things that can come out of that.

34:33.680 --> 34:40.240
Are there any specific projects that the studio has built that you'd like to call out and

34:40.240 --> 34:41.240
talk about?

34:41.240 --> 34:42.400
Yeah, certainly.

34:42.400 --> 34:46.880
I guess two of the big ones would be actually the two that you had mentioned, the goo font

34:46.880 --> 34:49.280
and the goo icons.

34:49.280 --> 34:59.240
Those projects started off as a project for our internal design and our outward appearance

34:59.240 --> 35:05.200
and such, because as the name implies, the goo theme is our biggest thing.

35:05.200 --> 35:08.200
That's the base of the entire company.

35:08.200 --> 35:14.360
Making a font that's based upon this and then web icons that are based upon this is primarily

35:14.360 --> 35:22.560
directed at improving the look and the feel of our own website, but of course, why make

35:22.560 --> 35:28.280
something that's just for ourselves when we can make it available to others?

35:28.280 --> 35:37.640
I decided the goo icons themselves, I would make a free accessible web font that anybody

35:37.640 --> 35:42.560
can download and use on their own websites with, of course, the ability to request new

35:42.560 --> 35:44.840
icons to be added.

35:44.840 --> 35:51.380
Then the goo font and other related fonts would be available for just $15 for both commercial

35:51.380 --> 35:59.040
and non-commercial with continuous implementation of new Unicode blocks for additional language

35:59.040 --> 36:00.040
support.

36:00.040 --> 36:10.000
We're currently working on Chinese and Japanese as our next ones, which I found to be...

36:10.000 --> 36:12.120
You immediately know what I'm talking about.

36:12.120 --> 36:19.360
I was severely underestimating the number of characters and how big of a dent my wallet

36:19.360 --> 36:20.360
would have.

36:20.360 --> 36:24.560
That is very interesting.

36:24.560 --> 36:30.440
I've toyed with the idea of creating a typeface because I find typography fascinating myself

36:30.440 --> 36:37.120
also, but having looked into it, it's like I really need to set some time aside to really

36:37.120 --> 36:42.480
understand this whole artistry of creating typefaces.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.480
It's fascinating.

36:43.480 --> 36:47.120
For now, I'll just enjoy the beautiful ones that exist and try and make something useful

36:47.120 --> 36:48.120
with them.

36:48.120 --> 36:52.760
Maybe one day I'll explore making my own.

36:52.760 --> 36:58.600
I know you're heavily involved in open source in general, from what I can tell anyway.

36:58.600 --> 37:06.320
What do you see the role of open source in education, but then also in making a better

37:06.320 --> 37:07.320
web?

37:07.320 --> 37:14.460
I think having open technologies and open standards means that everyone is able to utilize

37:14.460 --> 37:17.800
these to improve their own projects.

37:17.800 --> 37:23.200
If they're improving their own projects, it's providing resources to help others improve

37:23.200 --> 37:29.640
their own projects and so on and so forth, eventually improving the entire world as we

37:29.640 --> 37:30.720
know it.

37:30.720 --> 37:41.240
I think it's a very powerful community and just helps improve the world overall.

37:41.240 --> 37:45.400
There are problems inherent in open source, but they are being talked about much more

37:45.400 --> 37:46.400
now.

37:46.400 --> 37:51.320
There's accessibility, where for the longest time, it was something that was tacked on

37:51.320 --> 37:56.840
at the end and it's become front and center now and it's really great to see that.

37:56.840 --> 38:06.640
I think in the same fashion, open source has had inherent problems that everybody acknowledged,

38:06.640 --> 38:08.160
but not in the open.

38:08.160 --> 38:12.840
If you had a bunch of maintainers in the room, it would be clear that there's a problem.

38:12.840 --> 38:18.960
If you looked at it from the outside, you would not see the problem necessarily.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.720
It's multifaceted.

38:20.720 --> 38:26.620
Some of it has to do with people feeling entitled to demand certain things from people who run

38:26.620 --> 38:29.880
open source projects and it's like, are you being serious?

38:29.880 --> 38:35.400
This thing is for free, even contribute, chill out.

38:35.400 --> 38:43.480
And just the mere fact that the whole thing of giving away everything for free, while

38:43.480 --> 38:50.080
it's wonderful and all of that, it can only go so far until you really need to understand

38:50.080 --> 39:01.040
that these are actual human beings with real lives trying to make great software products

39:01.040 --> 39:08.680
and sustain themselves and it's not very scalable, as they say, to do this for free.

39:08.680 --> 39:17.800
There needs to be some kind of model that gives you the ability to also have a life.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.840
Even if you write the greatest open source project in the world, if you have to pay your

39:21.840 --> 39:25.480
mortgage, they're not going to care about that if you don't have money to pay.

39:25.480 --> 39:26.800
Exactly.

39:26.800 --> 39:32.080
I think that's one of the biggest benefits of platforms like the Open Collective, for

39:32.080 --> 39:43.320
example, allowing donors or sorry, donators like individuals and big companies to contribute

39:43.320 --> 39:50.360
financially to these projects to sustain their development and to sustain those behind the

39:50.360 --> 39:53.360
development as well.

39:53.360 --> 40:01.320
And I think it's an amazing thing to see all of these users and big companies as well

40:01.320 --> 40:11.720
that are so willing to drop huge amounts either individually or collectively to sustain the

40:11.720 --> 40:14.720
development of these open source projects.

40:14.720 --> 40:19.360
It goes to show that they really enjoy these projects and they want to see them continue.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.360
Yeah.

40:20.360 --> 40:32.080
I mean, I can't think of one massive web service, whatever you want to call it, website that

40:32.080 --> 40:39.680
does not heavily rely on open source and who can honestly not say that their success is

40:39.680 --> 40:41.920
because of open source.

40:41.920 --> 40:48.280
Like a lot of the things that seem to come overnight, the ability to build things so

40:48.280 --> 40:53.080
fast is because there's so many building blocks you just have to compose together that are

40:53.080 --> 40:55.120
open and free.

40:55.120 --> 41:03.080
I actually just had one more thing in closing and that is just like, what do you enjoy doing

41:03.080 --> 41:08.240
when the internet doesn't work so well?

41:08.240 --> 41:11.440
It's kind of hard to say, honestly.

41:11.440 --> 41:17.040
I guess there is one thing that I do enjoy doing offline and that would actually have

41:17.040 --> 41:18.680
to be geocaching.

41:18.680 --> 41:23.800
I think that geocaching is a great way to explore different cities or even different

41:23.800 --> 41:32.920
countries or different locations altogether to experience its most beautiful locations,

41:32.920 --> 41:34.360
I would say.

41:34.360 --> 41:40.480
I enjoy going out and hunting for different geocaches and such.

41:40.480 --> 41:46.200
There's also the geocaching puzzles and we're a really big puzzle fan.

41:46.200 --> 41:52.080
So typically speaking, whenever I'm going out on vacation or really just traveling to

41:52.080 --> 41:58.640
anywhere else, I'll pop up in the geocaching app, look for some that are in my area, and

41:58.640 --> 41:59.640
go and find them.

41:59.640 --> 42:06.600
That is super interesting and I'm going to be honest inside and have a clue what geocaching

42:06.600 --> 42:07.600
is.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.600
What is that?

42:08.600 --> 42:09.600
It sounds super interesting.

42:09.600 --> 42:18.200
Yeah, so geocaching is, in a nutshell, it's a worldwide treasure hunt.

42:18.200 --> 42:23.320
There are so many different users on the geocaching platform that will hide different containers

42:23.320 --> 42:33.280
that contain a couple of little trinkets, a little bit of toys or coins or different

42:33.280 --> 42:38.880
trackable tokens that you can take with you, and then a paper logbook.

42:38.880 --> 42:46.040
The paper logbook is for different hunters, finders, to sign when they have found the

42:46.040 --> 42:47.040
container.

42:47.040 --> 42:55.720
So to say, I have been here, I have found this hidden geocache, and then move on to

42:55.720 --> 42:56.960
the next one.

42:56.960 --> 43:01.000
One of the biggest things with geocaching is it's all about the hunt.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.640
It's all about finding these different containers, which can be hidden in pretty easy locations

43:06.640 --> 43:13.240
like inside of a telephone pole or maybe at the trunk of a tree.

43:13.240 --> 43:21.080
Some of them can have very intricate hiding spots like this, one of my favorite ones,

43:21.080 --> 43:23.480
like a gnome statue that it was hidden in.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.960
Wow, that is super interesting.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.640
Yeah, I had no idea.

43:26.640 --> 43:30.760
I'm definitely going to search a bit more about this and learn more about it.

43:30.760 --> 43:34.120
I wonder if that's going on here in South Africa as well.

43:34.120 --> 43:35.680
It'd be interesting to see.

43:35.680 --> 43:41.960
What's going on in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, South Africa as well.

43:41.960 --> 43:45.920
You can pretty much find a geocache anywhere that you are.

43:45.920 --> 43:50.400
You can learn more at geocaching.com as well, not sponsored.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.720
Thanks so much, Vinyl, for joining me for this chat.

43:52.720 --> 43:53.720
It was really good.

43:53.720 --> 44:00.240
I learned so much more about you that I had no idea about, and that's always great.
