00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,600
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
Hey, Vinyl.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,520
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,680
Thanks so much for joining me.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,560
Thank you very much for having me.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,240
It's a pleasure.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,960
So in the past, I'm learning podcasting as I make these.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,400
I think it's kind of like how code works, right?

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,280
You learn it as you make things.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,200
And so in the beginning, I used to always kind of read people's bio out.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,960
And I thought, nah, that's so been done a million times.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,080
I want to do something else.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,300
So what I basically want to do is keep quiet and let you talk.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,200
So you can go as far back as you want.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,520
But basically tell us about your story, like who is Vinyl and how did you get to where

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
you are today?

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
Where are you today?

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,000
And maybe even some things that you are looking forward to in the future?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, certainly.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,760
Oh, gosh, where to start, though?

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,200
Well, I guess I'll start with my name.

23
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Hi, my name is Vinyl Daigu.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:20,720
I am a web developer and web documentation writer for MDN Web Docs as well as Open Web

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Docs.

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,880
Fun fact, I actually started off with a multimedia background not a lot of people know.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,360
Actually never really got my coding experience from college or any traditional education.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:41,880
It was mostly just me playing around my own time with a wonderful private coding tutor.

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,680
And well, here I am now.

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:56,760
So my background started with doing mostly After Effects type stuff, so film color grading,

31
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,560
doing animation for big film industries and stuff.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,940
Not like 3D, more of the 2D visual effects, like adding particles to some sort of wizardry

33
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,480
show or something like that.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,960
Also started with doing music as well, like writing soundtracks and orchestral type stuff.

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Oh, wow.

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
That is amazing.

37
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
Thank you.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
Is any of that stuff available online?

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:29,440
Yeah, I've got all of the music that I have written is available on my SoundCloud at soundcloud.com

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
slash Queen Guborg.

41
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,080
It is also available on my YouTube, including my animation works at youtube.com slash Queen

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,480
Guborg, or you can search up my name, Vinyl Daigyu Kazutetsu, and you will find me.

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
Oh, awesome.

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
I'll share these links.

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,920
I'm really curious about this.

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,400
I'd love to listen to it.

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
So talking about that, you do have a very unique name.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,180
Like I said, it kind of makes me think of artists like Grimes and people like that.

49
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,960
What is the story behind the name?

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,160
So the first part about it, the vinyl part, mostly comes from the musical experience,

51
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,120
as I mentioned.

52
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,520
Most people think that I'm referring to me being like a disc jockey or a DJ, but that's

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,680
not really the same thing as somebody that writes music.

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,160
A DJ is somebody that's mixing existing songs together.

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,280
But I thought about it and the name kind of stuck, so I'm like, eh, vinyl, let's keep

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
it.

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
That's a very cool name.

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
I really like it.

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,800
In preparation for the conversation, I dug through some of your tweets, and I looked

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,160
at some of the websites that you've made and the things you've written, and we've worked

61
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
together.

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,400
Truth be told, we work together almost on a daily basis on MDN and related projects.

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,760
So I also know some things about how you work and the things you do through that, and there's

64
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,280
some stuff there that I'd like to ask you about a bit later on.

65
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,240
But before we get to that, I saw a retweet of yours that kind of struck me as well, and

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,520
I know you retweeted it because it struck a chord with you as well.

67
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,600
The tweet features a graphic, and there's these words that say, the reason why some

68
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,960
people are so kind is because the world has been so unkind to them, that they don't want

69
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,160
other people to feel the way they did.

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,800
And for me, I do wish there was more kindness in the world.

71
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,440
And I think in the last two, three years, everything that's happened in the world and

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,880
continues to happen, there's a feeling of cynicism that is set into a lot of people.

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,680
And it's sad.

74
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
It's hard.

75
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,960
I mean, I sometimes go through that myself, which I guess is human, but sometimes more

76
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:46,200
than I'd like, to always try to find something to make me not give up, essentially.

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:55,680
But I'd like to hear why that phrase, why that tweet had an impact on you.

78
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:05,920
It definitely struck a chord with me, that particular image, and going through the...

79
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,360
I guess trying to do so many different things, as I have done in the past with the music,

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,840
the animation, trying to get my fingers into so many different things, I've learned all

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,920
about these different communities, how they work, how they operate, the good, and unfortunately,

82
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
the bad as well.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,640
And I've had a lot of negative experiences in the past with others who have different

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,400
ideas, different mindsets, and quite frankly, different ideas about how to behave towards

85
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
others as well.

86
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,040
I've been the center of a lot of hate for many different things, one, being a furry,

87
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:51,920
two, being transgender, three, just for having my own ideas.

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,740
So I want to be one of those individuals in the world that is not like that.

89
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,440
I want to be one of the good souls in this world, because I believe that the more that

90
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,960
we give to help others, the more good we will receive ourselves, and the better the world

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,960
will be.

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Yeah.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,560
And you're doing a good job at that, by the way.

94
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,800
I can acknowledge that for one, having worked with you closely.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,960
So going down the same path and getting a bit more specific maybe, maybe a bit broader,

96
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:33,880
I think we can all acknowledge that there are problems in the tech industry.

97
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,040
Some have gotten better, but it's also maybe not entirely unique to the tech industry.

98
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,400
Maybe it's more of just the way we work problem, but I personally can only speak to what I've

99
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,560
experienced, so that is tech, and that is kind of the topic of the podcast and the audience.

100
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,520
So why do you see as some of the biggest problems in technology, and do you feel free to be

101
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,480
as broad or narrow as you want?

102
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:05,320
I think probably one of the biggest issues that I face on a daily basis is educating

103
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:11,840
those to what is available out there for them in terms of technology.

104
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,960
One of the things I do on the side is computer repair, and as a part of that, a lot of my

105
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,600
job ends up being teaching others how to use their computer in the first place, or what

106
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,840
the difference between Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge is, or heck, even the difference between

107
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,400
left and right mouse click.

108
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:42,040
I think that there needs to be more programs out there to teach individuals how to use

109
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,600
a computer, what a computer is, how it works, also how to avoid scams that are on the computer,

110
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,400
because the people that don't know how to use a computer as much are the ones that get

111
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,640
targeted the most, because they don't understand these differences, and I think it would be

112
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:05,440
pretty great to see some more government-funded programs and stuff to educate their citizens

113
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,600
on the 21st century, basically.

114
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:19,760
It's kind of strange that if you think about it from a narrow perspective, like somebody

115
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,560
that's in the tech industry, you completely forget about the fact that there are a lot

116
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,040
of people that don't know how to use the basic things about a computer.

117
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,680
One often hears that if you ask somebody, like, what is the internet, they'll tell

118
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,920
you Facebook, or they'll tell you Google, and that's their concept, that's their understanding

119
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,360
of what the internet is.

120
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,680
They don't understand that there's so much more to it than just those two service providers

121
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,280
or big corporate companies, and then of course, just like you said, the very, very basics

122
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,280
of, okay, I keep my computers on, now what do I do with this thing?

123
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,680
A lot of people don't know.

124
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,480
I think with early-stage web developers, that is the same thing.

125
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,800
I think once you get to a certain point, you can kind of figure stuff out yourself, and

126
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,000
you kind of get to know where to find the answers that you're looking for.

127
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,600
But if you're completely new, I'm not sure we're doing a really good job there of onboarding

128
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
folks.

129
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:30,320
I agree with that, and it's quite a challenge to figure out how to write these guides for

130
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,400
these beginners as well, because us being so experienced with technology and the different

131
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,320
technologies that are available to us, like being an expert in the field, there are things

132
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:50,600
that we just know instinctively at this point, and we kind of forget what people need to

133
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,320
be taught in that same sense, what they need to learn before they get to the more advanced

134
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
levels.

135
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Yeah, for sure.

136
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,480
Like the Massey network, part of, well, I guess the core function or the core reason

137
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,360
that exists is basically to try and solve this by talking to exactly those people and

138
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,800
asking them, like, what are your pain points?

139
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Why?

140
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,380
Where do you get frustrated?

141
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,880
And so it's not just understanding why you're getting into tech, but okay, now that you're

142
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,000
trying to get into it, what is the roadblocks you're facing?

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,280
And oftentimes you think it might be stuff like work experience, and that is definitely

144
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,760
a problem, or like interviews, or how do I find a job?

145
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:43,160
But oftentimes it's more like, no, it's not that, it's, I don't know where to begin, or

146
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,080
I've started, but now I'm kind of stuck at this point and there's so much information

147
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,080
and I don't know where to go from here.

148
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,480
And I kind of end up spinning my wheels and getting a bit demotivated.

149
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,160
So yeah, I do think there's room here for curation.

150
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,280
That is what I've learned.

151
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,400
Not so much creating new content necessarily.

152
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,160
I think places like MDN and that do a great job of it, but the curation is maybe with

153
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
the missing piece.

154
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I agree.

155
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,680
So staying with tweets, another one that caught my eyes is this meme that you tweeted where

156
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,480
you said like, when explaining to non-developers what you do, this is like a meme that you

157
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
use.

158
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,560
I found that very interesting.

159
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,760
Can you maybe, seeing this as a podcast, people can't see the visual, I'll link to it, of

160
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,960
course, but can you maybe explain the tweet a little bit and like how you use that to

161
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,200
explain to people what it is you do?

162
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,920
Yeah, certainly.

163
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,920
So I always had thought about the big brain, bigger brain, biggest brain meme that you're

164
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,640
referring to.

165
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:56,840
And a lot of times in the past when I tried to explain what I do to others, they wouldn't

166
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:05,480
really understand the difference between doing the web development itself versus documenting

167
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,220
how to write websites and what are the technologies available in these browsers.

168
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:20,520
So I always like referred to that meme whenever I would talk about it and say like, it is

169
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:27,480
web development related, but what we are doing here at MDN Web Docs is a step beyond that

170
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,280
because we are teaching others how to write websites, not necessarily writing our own

171
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
websites.

172
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,960
And I mean, I do do web development still, like I have my own personal website, I have

173
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,200
the one for my company, I do contract web development for other companies as well.

174
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:53,440
But when it comes to what I am contracted to do for MDN Web Docs and Open Web Docs,

175
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,040
it's not really much to do with the web development itself, more so the teaching others how to

176
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
do it.

177
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
Okay, that's cool.

178
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,000
Yeah, I think that that is that could be a tricky subject to explain and to really get

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
across.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,880
But I think you did a good job of doing that just now.

181
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
So thank you.

182
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,200
I still have one one of my family members still thinks that when I say browser compatibility

183
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,900
data, and I'm talking about the MDN BCD project, they still think to this day, that I am referring

184
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:34,240
to writing cross browser compatible websites, and every single time I have to explain, no,

185
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,120
I'm documenting what web browsers support what features so others are able to do that.

186
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Yeah.

187
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,280
So I had this question phrased a little differently in the doc, but now having talked, I'm thinking

188
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,320
about the phrase a little different.

189
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,560
You've mentioned that, that, like, you didn't do the traditional like on ramp to getting

190
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:04,000
into tech and you come from like a music slash art slash animation background, which I mean,

191
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,280
if I had a penny for the number of people who've come to take from musicianship, I'd

192
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,600
be a very rich man at this point.

193
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Because I myself was a classical guitarist before I got into tech.

194
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,880
But at some point, you decided that, you know what, I think I'm going to switch to software

195
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,680
documentation as a career, which is also interesting because not directly web development necessary

196
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,040
as a career, but documenting the web as you just explained.

197
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,560
What was it about this stuff?

198
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,640
Why documentation?

199
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,600
Why did that get you really excited and make you change careers?

200
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:50,040
So I think one of the biggest things, it's kind of in different stages, if I had to say.

201
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,960
The first stage was attempting to pursue a traditional education for music production

202
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,040
and music composition and stuff.

203
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,320
I took college courses for it.

204
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,200
Honestly speaking, I think that was one of the biggest mistakes that I have made in my

205
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:14,000
life, particularly because I don't know if other colleges do this, but for the one that

206
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,640
I was doing and the classes that I was attending, they were pushing more for quantity and really

207
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,520
trying to push you to write song after song after song after song.

208
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,680
That led to pretty much burning me out permanently.

209
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:40,120
I was putting so many ideas down in such a short amount of time, it was like two months,

210
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,160
three months, and I had written maybe 20, maybe 30 different pieces.

211
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,120
At that point, I was just burnt out and I couldn't think about any other ideas for my

212
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,200
own projects, for anyone else's projects.

213
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,320
So after that, I kind of put that to halt and started focusing more on the animation

214
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:10,160
side of things, so the music visualizers, the light shows type stuff.

215
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,520
That was pretty fun, but I was quickly getting frustrated with my computer crashing a bunch

216
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,200
on me and the software crashing and taking so long to render because I was doing all

217
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,840
this complicated stuff, the computer was like, whoa, there, I got to process this.

218
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:36,360
Really considering the fact I was rendering out 4K videos and 4K at 60 frames a second

219
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,720
before anybody else on YouTube did.

220
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,520
Most people were still doing the standard full HD 1080p at 30 frames a second.

221
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,760
Me, I wanted to get a head start on the future of videos and stuff, especially because I

222
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:57,360
noticed that rendering it out in 4K, there's a lot more information for the computer to

223
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,920
downscale to 1080p and the images would look a lot crisper, they'd look a lot smoother

224
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,760
and stuff.

225
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:13,040
But after a while, I was doing that and I was doing the visualizers for a EDM promotional

226
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,800
channel on YouTube, which that was going pretty good for quite some time.

227
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:26,420
But unfortunately, as I started to get more and more of a bigger role in that, turns out

228
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:36,200
my interests in music don't really align with the majority of EDM listeners' preferences,

229
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,280
so it ended up causing the channel to lose subscriptions and stuff and then people started

230
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,440
hating me for that and eventually I was like, okay, you know what?

231
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,620
I give up on this, I'm done, I'm gonna go ahead and move on to something that's probably

232
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,840
a little bad for my skillset.

233
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:02,160
So I was looking around for software development stuff, for web development things.

234
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:09,340
I stumbled across the BCD project and saw that I was looking for some help, so I started

235
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,960
to do some pull requests for it, really get into that.

236
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,280
Eventually I started enjoying it more and more until that became like my full-time project,

237
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,080
like I was working on that almost 24-7.

238
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:32,320
In the end, I grew in a heavy appreciation for documenting the World Wide Web and creating

239
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,760
resources for others to learn upon, and something clicked in me at that time.

240
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,800
I thought, hey, this is really awesome, being able to provide resources for others to improve

241
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
their stuff.

242
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,480
This is really amazing and a wonderful goal and I want to be a part of that.

243
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,200
I want to help improve the world for the better.

244
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,680
Yeah, those are all great missions to have.

245
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,440
I share the same thing, that's for sure.

246
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,520
So that is super interesting.

247
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:16,600
So how do you counteract or try and prevent burnout in this new career?

248
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:24,880
The reason I asked that is because working with you, you're super productive.

249
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,760
You get things done really fast and really well.

250
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,680
So is this just pure enthusiasm, or do you have specific techniques you can share with

251
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
everybody?

252
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,400
And then how do you ensure that you don't burn out in this new career?

253
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,680
First of all, it means a lot to me to hear those words.

254
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,320
I really appreciate hearing that.

255
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:54,520
I would say probably one of the most helpful things is not just working on a single project

256
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,040
all the time.

257
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,000
Because if you're doing the exact same thing over and over and over again, eventually it's

258
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,280
going to wear you out, you're going to get tired of it, you're going to get sick of it,

259
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,160
and if you continue, you're eventually going to get completely burnt out.

260
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,120
So for me, what I do is I switch between different projects a lot.

261
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,160
I'm still sticking with mostly the projects within the MDN Web Docs repositories and stuff,

262
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,360
but I'm working on the BCD project, I'm working on some content eventually, then I'm working

263
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:32,800
on the core engine for MDN Web Docs, and then I'm working on one of the aspects for the

264
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,360
interactive examples that you see, and then switching back and forth between them, then

265
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,520
spending some time on my own personal projects like my company website.

266
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,640
So I think probably the most helpful thing is not sticking to just one thing at a time,

267
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,560
but switching between them and trying different things.

268
00:20:53,560 --> 00:21:01,640
So that way you're always switching to something new, something fresh, and keeping the cycle

269
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
of fresh content.

270
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,120
Yeah, makes sense.

271
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:12,040
I also think that's one of the reasons I like the idea of open source.

272
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,720
One of many is this freedom to move between projects and also your own stuff, scratching

273
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,440
your own itch and all that.

274
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,600
Because I did do the corporate thing in the beginning of my career, and that was not a

275
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,440
good fit for me at all.

276
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:39,360
Getting up every day to build some back-end administrative console for some big mobile

277
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,720
company was just like, there's nothing here that means anything to me.

278
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:53,160
And then the working environment, like the company culture, was not great, so that doesn't

279
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
help.

280
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,320
You don't even have the people that you stay for.

281
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,800
So yeah, when I got into open source and when I started contracting with Mozilla about 11

282
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:11,560
years ago, I saw a whole new world for sure, and I can't see myself moving out of that

283
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,720
world ever, ever again.

284
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
So I get that.

285
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,280
I think of what they say, variety is the spice of life.

286
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:24,920
So I guess it's very true when it comes to coding as well and preventing burnout.

287
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:31,440
So that leads me to one question, and I'm going to push that one down the road a little

288
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,560
bit and just step back a little.

289
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,560
You gave some advice that I think is very good, where it's like, don't spend all your

290
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,560
time on a single thing, try different things because that keeps things interesting.

291
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:50,040
But beyond that, is there any advice you can share for early-stage web developers that's

292
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
starting their journey?

293
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:58,280
In this, to be honest, fast-paced industry, I'm sorry, I'm going a little bit over the

294
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,960
place with my brain keeps thinking things that you said that I wanted to get back to.

295
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,120
Because the stuff that you talked about with the music industry, I think that industry

296
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,260
is rough.

297
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,960
I think it's very, very, very demanding.

298
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,920
And I think it's because it's become like a kind of sausage factory.

299
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,680
It just has to keep pumping out more and more and more, and the faster the better, the more

300
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,440
money there is to do.

301
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,520
And I think that's one of the things I like more about open source versus corporate environments,

302
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,960
is that because there's more meaning to the work, I think people take a little bit more

303
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,880
time to consider how they do things and whether they should do things.

304
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,760
But yeah, coming back to what I wanted to ask you is, what advice do you have for early-stage

305
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,720
web developers that's just getting into this industry?

306
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,800
That's a really good question.

307
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,080
I would have to say one of the most impactful statements of advice that I would give to

308
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,560
an early web developer is don't give up.

309
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:11,280
As an early programmer, as an early software developer or web developer, you're going to

310
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,240
run into issues left and right.

311
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,160
There's always going to be some problem that's going to arise and you're going to have to

312
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,200
solve it.

313
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:28,720
I believe that failure is not the end, but rather a path to success and a learning experience.

314
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:36,680
So if something's got you stumped, don't give up, maybe take a step back for a little

315
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,360
bit and then come back to it with fresh eyes.

316
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,600
Or if you're really stumped, there's so many great resources online, like Stack Overflow,

317
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
for example.

318
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,120
You can ask basically any software development question and there are so many people who

319
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,080
will jump right onto the question and answer it for you.

320
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,120
Or most likely, if you're having an issue, your question has already been answered and

321
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,640
there are existing Stack Overflow or Reddit posts that answer the question with so many

322
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,840
different users giving really wonderful advice on those platforms.

323
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,040
So don't get discouraged, don't give up, keep pushing forward and you will reach your

324
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
goals eventually.

325
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,520
So interesting you mentioned Reddit, I'm slowly using it again.

326
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,080
How do you find Reddit as a platform?

327
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,440
Do you find it like being inviting and good for tech in general, but then also maybe new

328
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,920
folks?

329
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,520
I would say it depends on which communities on Reddit you go to.

330
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,600
There are some pretty amazing communities that are on Reddit that are actually really

331
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,200
inviting and welcoming.

332
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,160
And then there's the ones that are kind of like, oh, you're a person, well, screw you,

333
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,360
you're a crap stain on society.

334
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:08,360
I think just like anywhere on the internet, I would say, it depends on where you go.

335
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,840
There are going to be the bad apples out there, but there's also a lot of good apples if you

336
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
look in the right places.

337
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,200
Yeah, do you have any subreddits that you can recommend?

338
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,800
That's a good question, r slash JavaScript, I guess, would be one.

339
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,080
I don't really go on Reddit that much myself, but most of the time that I go on Reddit is

340
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,720
when I'm Google searching something and that's what comes up in the Google search results.

341
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Yeah, it shows you how different our search results are tailored based on our usage, because

342
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,360
I always never get Reddit in my search results when I search for stuff.

343
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:51,600
So I think r slash Python, so yeah, r slash Python.

344
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,960
Hot topic, like or dislike TypeScript and how early do you think web developer should start

345
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
paying attention to it?

346
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,080
Oh, this is a definitely a hot take.

347
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,040
I personally despise JavaScript, not JavaScript.

348
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,200
I personally despise TypeScript.

349
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:17,040
I like the concept behind it of having type checking for all of your variables to make

350
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,320
sure that you're sending nothing but exactly the types of inputs that you want and preparing

351
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
for those.

352
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:32,360
However, I think that there is a lot with TypeScript that really needs to be overhauled

353
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:41,320
and fixed and seeing the development stages for TypeScript or really any of the Microsoft

354
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,840
owned projects, I highly doubt that they're ever really going to get fixed.

355
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,280
What I would personally like to see is a TypeScript alternative, like a new project that introduces

356
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:59,360
the same things that TypeScript does, but in a much better developer friendly way.

357
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, so I don't know if I dreamt this or if this is a thing, but I've mentioned it

358
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,440
to somebody else as well.

359
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,400
I heard that Microsoft made a proposal to bring types to JavaScript.

360
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,920
Does that ring a bell?

361
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,720
I have not heard about this.

362
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,760
The tricky thing, of course, with anything you want to do to JavaScript is you have to

363
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,820
always make sure it's backwards compatible.

364
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:30,120
You can't just turn JavaScript into a typed language because 90% of the internet will

365
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,800
break.

366
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:40,520
I don't know if they want to do this in the form of annotations or exactly what, and maybe

367
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,360
this is something I thought I heard and I didn't, but I'm pretty sure that there was

368
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:52,080
this talk that Microsoft has proposed this to TC39 and that it's in discussion about

369
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,200
whether that's a good idea.

370
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,740
I spoke to somebody earlier today and it'll have to be really well thought out.

371
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,080
Maybe this is the opportunity that you're mentioning to rethink how it's done and do

372
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,160
it better.

373
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:19,240
I do worry about if this would present a barrier to people new to the web because currently

374
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,320
while making a website isn't the most complicated thing, it's not easy either, especially if

375
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,800
you want to do it well.

376
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,680
I think all the technologies are really approachable and you can get quite far even if you don't

377
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,320
know all the ins and outs of it.

378
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:45,760
I don't know if bringing typing to JavaScript would cause a bigger barrier to entry.

379
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:55,360
I see that there is a Microsoft dev blog post about this proposal from March 9th and what

380
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,320
I'm seeing here, if I'm reading this correctly, is that it would be bringing type definitions

381
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,800
to JavaScript but not necessarily require the type definitions.

382
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,800
If that's the case, then I would be for this because I think that one of the biggest barriers

383
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,520
with TypeScript itself is the fact that you have to go all or nothing with TypeScript.

384
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:28,560
You either do all type checking or you don't bother with TypeScript at all.

385
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:35,560
If JavaScript is kept backwards compatible in this sense where you can specify types

386
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:42,000
as you desire rather than having to specify all of the different types, then I think that

387
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,240
this proposal would actually be pretty helpful for the future of the World Wide Web.

388
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
That's cool.

389
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,720
That's an interesting take.

390
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,640
Like I said, I think maybe this is that opportunity where they can do it, they can improve and

391
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:04,060
take all the learnings that they've had with TypeScript because I have a love-age relationship

392
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,720
with it.

393
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,400
When you don't have to fight it, it's super useful, but I do find that oftentimes I feel

394
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:19,920
like I could have done something much, much faster if I didn't have to fight TypeScript.

395
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:24,520
That is especially true when it comes to DOM elements.

396
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,320
TypeScript don't seem to play very well with these things.

397
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,120
If you have an event and it's like it could be a button but it could also have come from

398
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,680
a link or it could have come from this, then typing starts to get pretty tricky.

399
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,760
Sometimes it throws up the weirdest errors about stuff like, oh, this thing could potentially

400
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,560
be null, but it's like, yeah, I guess, but I know that it never will be or this piece

401
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,360
of code wouldn't have run at all.

402
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,920
I definitely have a love-age relationship with it.

403
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,000
My personal opinion around that always has been I can see the value of it when you're

404
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,600
writing an API.

405
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,280
I'm not so sold on it when you just use it for good old front-end development.

406
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm not sure how much value it adds there.

407
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
I agree.

408
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,520
This was the exact same response that I had given to one of my old contracts when they

409
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,080
had asked if they should migrate over to TypeScript for their front-end.

410
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,600
They were asking me what I thought the upsides and downsides would be for it.

411
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,720
My response was pretty much exactly the same.

412
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,280
There's no real reason to migrate your front-end to TypeScript.

413
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,040
The back-end, yeah, totally.

414
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,500
It actually does provide some benefits for the back-end, but the front-end, just leave

415
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,760
it as pure JavaScript.

416
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Yeah.

417
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,960
I think we're talking the same language there for sure.

418
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,960
You've alluded to this before, but I want to bring it up.

419
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,080
You are the founder of Guborg Studios, and when I looked into it a little more, I learned

420
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,400
about Gufont and GooIcons, and the GooIcons are really cool.

421
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,140
I really like them a lot.

422
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:13,720
Can you tell us a little bit more about Guborg Studios and then these other two tangentially

423
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,200
related projects?

424
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah, certainly.

425
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,040
Guborg Studios had basically been my dream company for probably over a decade, maybe

426
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:32,140
a decade and a half, and I wanted to create this company that brings a bunch of different

427
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:39,800
kinds of artists, software developers, translators, et cetera, together under one roof so that

428
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,800
we can create these amazing projects together.

429
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:51,400
It actually started off as an idea for this one anime series that I wanted to do, which

430
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,320
later turned into the idea for a video game, which later turned into, well, just sitting

431
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,160
on my old MacBook back at home.

432
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,600
I really like that idea, because I myself am building a company, and the thing that

433
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:12,400
I didn't want it to be is yet another agency, and it's by some way or shape or form, it's

434
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,480
going to turn into that, and I'm not happy with it, and I want to now reevaluate everything

435
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,280
and change the direction, but I really like the idea of this multi-disciplinary kind of

436
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,440
approach where you're doing all these different creative things and you bring it together,

437
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,680
because I can just imagine the amazing things that can come out of that.

438
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:40,240
Are there any specific projects that the studio has built that you'd like to call out and

439
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
talk about?

440
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,400
Yeah, certainly.

441
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,880
I guess two of the big ones would be actually the two that you had mentioned, the goo font

442
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,280
and the goo icons.

443
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:59,240
Those projects started off as a project for our internal design and our outward appearance

444
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,200
and such, because as the name implies, the goo theme is our biggest thing.

445
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,200
That's the base of the entire company.

446
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,360
Making a font that's based upon this and then web icons that are based upon this is primarily

447
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:22,560
directed at improving the look and the feel of our own website, but of course, why make

448
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,280
something that's just for ourselves when we can make it available to others?

449
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:37,640
I decided the goo icons themselves, I would make a free accessible web font that anybody

450
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,560
can download and use on their own websites with, of course, the ability to request new

451
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,840
icons to be added.

452
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:51,380
Then the goo font and other related fonts would be available for just $15 for both commercial

453
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:59,040
and non-commercial with continuous implementation of new Unicode blocks for additional language

454
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
support.

455
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:10,000
We're currently working on Chinese and Japanese as our next ones, which I found to be...

456
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,120
You immediately know what I'm talking about.

457
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:19,360
I was severely underestimating the number of characters and how big of a dent my wallet

458
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
would have.

459
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,560
That is very interesting.

460
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,440
I've toyed with the idea of creating a typeface because I find typography fascinating myself

461
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,120
also, but having looked into it, it's like I really need to set some time aside to really

462
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,480
understand this whole artistry of creating typefaces.

463
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
It's fascinating.

464
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,120
For now, I'll just enjoy the beautiful ones that exist and try and make something useful

465
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
with them.

466
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,760
Maybe one day I'll explore making my own.

467
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,600
I know you're heavily involved in open source in general, from what I can tell anyway.

468
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:06,320
What do you see the role of open source in education, but then also in making a better

469
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
web?

470
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:14,460
I think having open technologies and open standards means that everyone is able to utilize

471
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,800
these to improve their own projects.

472
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,200
If they're improving their own projects, it's providing resources to help others improve

473
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,640
their own projects and so on and so forth, eventually improving the entire world as we

474
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,720
know it.

475
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:41,240
I think it's a very powerful community and just helps improve the world overall.

476
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,400
There are problems inherent in open source, but they are being talked about much more

477
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
now.

478
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,320
There's accessibility, where for the longest time, it was something that was tacked on

479
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,840
at the end and it's become front and center now and it's really great to see that.

480
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:06,640
I think in the same fashion, open source has had inherent problems that everybody acknowledged,

481
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,160
but not in the open.

482
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,840
If you had a bunch of maintainers in the room, it would be clear that there's a problem.

483
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,960
If you looked at it from the outside, you would not see the problem necessarily.

484
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,720
It's multifaceted.

485
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,620
Some of it has to do with people feeling entitled to demand certain things from people who run

486
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,880
open source projects and it's like, are you being serious?

487
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,400
This thing is for free, even contribute, chill out.

488
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:43,480
And just the mere fact that the whole thing of giving away everything for free, while

489
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:50,080
it's wonderful and all of that, it can only go so far until you really need to understand

490
00:38:50,080 --> 00:39:01,040
that these are actual human beings with real lives trying to make great software products

491
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,680
and sustain themselves and it's not very scalable, as they say, to do this for free.

492
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:17,800
There needs to be some kind of model that gives you the ability to also have a life.

493
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,840
Even if you write the greatest open source project in the world, if you have to pay your

494
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,480
mortgage, they're not going to care about that if you don't have money to pay.

495
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,800
Exactly.

496
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,080
I think that's one of the biggest benefits of platforms like the Open Collective, for

497
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:43,320
example, allowing donors or sorry, donators like individuals and big companies to contribute

498
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:50,360
financially to these projects to sustain their development and to sustain those behind the

499
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,360
development as well.

500
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:01,320
And I think it's an amazing thing to see all of these users and big companies as well

501
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:11,720
that are so willing to drop huge amounts either individually or collectively to sustain the

502
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,720
development of these open source projects.

503
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,360
It goes to show that they really enjoy these projects and they want to see them continue.

504
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
Yeah.

505
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:32,080
I mean, I can't think of one massive web service, whatever you want to call it, website that

506
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:39,680
does not heavily rely on open source and who can honestly not say that their success is

507
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,920
because of open source.

508
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,280
Like a lot of the things that seem to come overnight, the ability to build things so

509
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,080
fast is because there's so many building blocks you just have to compose together that are

510
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,120
open and free.

511
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:03,080
I actually just had one more thing in closing and that is just like, what do you enjoy doing

512
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:08,240
when the internet doesn't work so well?

513
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,440
It's kind of hard to say, honestly.

514
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,040
I guess there is one thing that I do enjoy doing offline and that would actually have

515
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,680
to be geocaching.

516
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,800
I think that geocaching is a great way to explore different cities or even different

517
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:32,920
countries or different locations altogether to experience its most beautiful locations,

518
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,360
I would say.

519
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:40,480
I enjoy going out and hunting for different geocaches and such.

520
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,200
There's also the geocaching puzzles and we're a really big puzzle fan.

521
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,080
So typically speaking, whenever I'm going out on vacation or really just traveling to

522
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:58,640
anywhere else, I'll pop up in the geocaching app, look for some that are in my area, and

523
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
go and find them.

524
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:06,600
That is super interesting and I'm going to be honest inside and have a clue what geocaching

525
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
is.

526
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
What is that?

527
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
It sounds super interesting.

528
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:18,200
Yeah, so geocaching is, in a nutshell, it's a worldwide treasure hunt.

529
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,320
There are so many different users on the geocaching platform that will hide different containers

530
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:33,280
that contain a couple of little trinkets, a little bit of toys or coins or different

531
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,880
trackable tokens that you can take with you, and then a paper logbook.

532
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,040
The paper logbook is for different hunters, finders, to sign when they have found the

533
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
container.

534
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:55,720
So to say, I have been here, I have found this hidden geocache, and then move on to

535
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,960
the next one.

536
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,000
One of the biggest things with geocaching is it's all about the hunt.

537
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,640
It's all about finding these different containers, which can be hidden in pretty easy locations

538
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:13,240
like inside of a telephone pole or maybe at the trunk of a tree.

539
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:21,080
Some of them can have very intricate hiding spots like this, one of my favorite ones,

540
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,480
like a gnome statue that it was hidden in.

541
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,960
Wow, that is super interesting.

542
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,640
Yeah, I had no idea.

543
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,760
I'm definitely going to search a bit more about this and learn more about it.

544
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,120
I wonder if that's going on here in South Africa as well.

545
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,680
It'd be interesting to see.

546
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,960
What's going on in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan, South Africa as well.

547
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,920
You can pretty much find a geocache anywhere that you are.

548
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,400
You can learn more at geocaching.com as well, not sponsored.

549
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,720
