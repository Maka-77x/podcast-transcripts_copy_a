00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,880
Welcome, Andreas, to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,720
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720
I'm super excited.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,960
It's a huge pleasure.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,200
It's been a long time in the making.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,640
We've discussed and gone back and forth and back and forth over polywork, and finally

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,440
we found a day in time that works for everybody, so I'm glad.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,360
We have business trips, am I right?

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then the holidays and everything.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,560
To start off with, can you tell us â€“ I know you mentioned before we started that this

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,000
is probably the most uncomfortable question of the bunch, so let's get that one out

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,880
of the way.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,480
If you can tell us a little bit about who you are, your career, and then what gets you

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,520
up in the morning.

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,800
Yeah.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
I'm Andreas.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm a software engineer.

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,680
Currently, I'm a R&D software developer at Encompass Technologies.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,760
Basically it's an alcoholic beverage software as a service where essentially we help all

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,600
three tiers of the U.S. alcohol distribution system, so whether that's people who make

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,160
beer, people who distribute beer, and then people who sell beer, and obviously other

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,360
wines, spirits, etc.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,640
I handle a lot of integrations with a database called DSD-Link where it's got global product

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,700
data, global customer data throughout the entire Encompass network, so then as we get

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,300
more partners and stuff like that on, I usually handle a lot of the integrations and stuff

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,380
like that.

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:52,640
In terms of outside of work, I've been doing programming software development for

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,440
about four or five years now.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,120
When I'm not programming and stuff, I love Dungeons and Dragons.

32
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,080
I play around with some tarot every now and then, and then also tattoos and home brewing

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,240
mead actually.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,440
In general, I just like to jump around to a whole bunch of different hobbies.

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,960
My partner keeps me plenty busy.

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,400
She's like, oh, this is a great idea.

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,520
We should go and try this, and I'm like, yeah, sure, yeah, sure, let's do it.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,640
Kind of like all over the place, but those are the main things that I usually am found

39
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,640
doing.

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,320
That sounds great.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:41,000
Can you explain a bit about what mead is and what the brewing process involves?

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,240
With mead, a lot of people like to equate it to honey wine, so essentially the main

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:56,240
primary ingredient that you're fermenting is honey, and the yeast consume that honey.

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Usually there's a couple steps where you go through primary fermentation and then you

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,360
rack it into a separate container and secondary fermentation.

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:14,160
Essentially all you're doing is having the yeast consume those different sugars, and

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,640
with honey it creates a unique flavor that my partner and I really like, where it's

48
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,520
a little bit sweeter and it's more depending on the type of honey that you use and type

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,400
of yeast, it will likely be a lot closer to a white wine, like a sweeter, maybe like a

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Pinot Grigio.

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,800
In general, it's been a lot of fun.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,760
We've done a whole bunch of different small batches of like a gallon, one of the ones

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,160
that we're really proud of is one that we call the May Queen, which is basically like

54
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:55,240
blood oranges, lemon zest, vanilla, and a couple more other flavors with some really

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,600
high quality alpine honey from up here in Colorado.

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,280
You'd be surprised how much good honey makes a difference.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:11,120
If you just go to the supermarket and drop honey that you pick up at the supermarket,

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,500
obviously that will get you there, but we like to do smaller batches with higher quality

59
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,880
ingredients and generally we just do it for ourselves and a couple of family members.

60
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,040
It's a lot of fun to just be able to experiment with the different ingredients and see how

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,800
the yeast takes it and creates these different flavors.

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah, it's super cool.

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,440
Honey, it makes a big difference if you get the real stuff, not the mix, the half and

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,120
half that you often get at the supermarket.

65
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:50,920
We have a little honey company about 10 kilometers from where I stay and when we buy honey from

66
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,040
them, you immediately notice the difference.

67
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,680
I can use that in my coffee and it tastes great, whereas if you use the honey from the

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,280
supermarket, it's like, I'm not too sure about this.

69
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,400
It's doubly so with me because the yeast take on a lot of those flavors or off flavors as

70
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
well.

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,600
If they don't have as much real sugars and stuff to consume, it's a lot harder for them

72
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,040
to make a flavor that is actually pleasant.

73
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,700
There's a lot of different variables that go into, obviously with brewing in general,

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,920
you could create some off flavors with certain ingredients.

75
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:35,280
It's just a huge balancing act, but to your point on the coffee and stuff, you can immediately

76
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
tell the difference.

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,800
Yeah, for sure.

78
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
That's fascinating.

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Yeah, I can imagine how that can become a really interesting hobby.

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,920
It leads into my second question that I kind of had because I picked this up when I write

81
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:53,320
some stuff in your, I can't remember if it was Lictin or if it was Polywork, where you're

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:01,320
clearly enthusiastic about beer, I think specifically, but maybe other alcohol variants as well.

83
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,280
More than that, this idea that it brings people together, it forms community.

84
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm curious, the MyCMNitric podcast is part of a larger community around early stage developers.

85
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,920
Obviously, community is very important to us and to me.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,040
I wonder, what gets you excited about community?

87
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,380
Why are you so excited about this whole idea of beer and then the beer forming this community

88
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,040
bringing people together?

89
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,720
What is it about that stuff that makes you excited?

90
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,240
Yeah, so I will say a lot of that has been kind of my exposure to the beverage industry

91
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,720
with Encompass, which I'm really appreciative of because it really opened my eyes to just

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,220
how much work goes behind the scenes to get a beer on your table or a wine or whatever

93
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:01,960
the case may be, the amount of work and the amount of talent that goes into it to get

94
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,720
a beer into the distributor and then go from the distributor to the retailer and then be

95
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
able to sell that to you.

96
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,920
There's a lot of work behind the scenes that goes into it and all of that is people who

97
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,760
are extremely talented, extremely passionate about the beer, well, the beverages that they

98
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
sell.

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:29,640
It's the same beer, but realistically, it's so much more than that and really the more

100
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:37,000
I got exposed to it, the more I realized just how much of it is community really.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,120
Whether you are making beer, distributing beer or selling it, there is a community that

102
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,800
kind of revolves around it.

103
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,520
There's so many different little neighborhoods and even just in the United States, but worldwide

104
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,160
where there's a liquor store somewhere in that community and that whenever there's

105
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,040
a party, there's something like that, usually you're going and grabbing beer, you're going

106
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,680
and grabbing some wine, you're grabbing some cider.

107
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:10,520
It's something that you don't necessarily think about, but it's what it's used for.

108
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,920
It's used for celebrations, it's used for parties, it's used for things that bring people

109
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,400
together and things that we can celebrate together.

110
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,200
That's one thing that I really realized as I started working in the beverage industry

111
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:30,000
with this software, that it's just such an amazing community and the more you engage

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,440
with it, the more you get out of it.

113
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,960
People are always willing to talk to you about brewing, regardless of what kind of brewing

114
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,800
it is, you can get along with somebody who has only ever brewed beer in their life.

115
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,040
If you just say, hey, I do cider, I do mead, I do this other weird thing that I decided

116
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,840
to ferment this very specific plant or something like that, at the very least you have that

117
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,800
kind of common bond where you're going and trying to make something new and pleasant

118
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,040
that's like at the end of the day, you're sharing that with somebody.

119
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,640
You're not necessarily just sitting around doing that by yourself, at least you've got

120
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,440
a partner, you've got some friends that you want to share that with.

121
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,600
Even if that's online, there's so much to it that is just community that people don't

122
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
necessarily realize.

123
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:34,360
For me, that's really the excitement aspect of it where I love contributing to that community

124
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:42,160
because at the end of the day, it's such a big component of the human experience, I would

125
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,160
say, because it's just been alcohol fermented beverages have been around as long as you

126
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,440
can probably remember.

127
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,240
It's something that we sometimes take for granted, but it's a valuable part of what

128
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
makes a community.

129
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:07,760
Yeah, agreed, and I think there's parallels to be drawn there to software.

130
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,240
If you build, if you write a little library or a little tool or something, it's always

131
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,720
great to have a community to go to and to say, hey, look at this thing I made and people

132
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,680
are like, that's really cool and you get that feedback and you get that even when people

133
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,360
tell you, oh, you know what, there's this way that you can make this even better.

134
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,760
I think it's the same thing when it comes to brewing.

135
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,320
If you share your brewing recipe, somebody might say, you know what, I did something

136
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,960
similar and I did this little difference and it made such a big, like you have this experience

137
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,840
with these different honeys and that having the real deal coming from a craft place or

138
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,000
something is so much better than the honey you get at the supermarket.

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,280
You might get somebody in the community who says, I'm making me, but I just can't quite

140
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,040
get there and you say, what honey are you using?

141
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,720
And they're like, oh, I'm using this thing from this place and you're like, you should

142
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,520
try and get it from a local farmer or something like somebody that works with bees because

143
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,360
that's going to make all the difference.

144
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,880
I think that knowledge sharing is a big part of it as well.

145
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Yeah.

146
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,640
I'll give another example on that.

147
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,480
It's like the usage of what kind of parts of the lemon to use in like a meat or something

148
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,800
like that because then a lot of times the acidity of things like lemons and stuff may

149
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,600
be adverse towards yeast depending on the other things that you put in there.

150
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,840
You can do stuff like add lipids to the yeast so that then it kind of strengthens their

151
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
cellular walls.

152
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,560
We're getting way into the very specifics there, but I have a lot of good friends that

153
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,840
are fermentation science majors, which I didn't know was a thing until I got to Encompass

154
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,880
where they kind of gave me that kind of feedback where like, hey, if you're trying to use

155
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:04,520
more acidic, less than ideal flavors that would be great for us to consume but not necessarily

156
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:12,920
ideal for the yeast to live in and produce alcohol in, you could potentially add some

157
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:21,160
additional things to strengthen the yeast and build up their tolerance, so to speak.

158
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,780
There's different parts of the lemon even.

159
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,680
We use like the pith and other parts of it instead of just straight up the lemon pieces

160
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,960
where you still get that kind of lemon flavor without necessarily introducing as much of

161
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
the acidity.

162
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Yeah.

163
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
I understand.

164
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:46,280
It sounds very similar to cooking, also knowing what parts of the vegetable or fruit or whatever

165
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:53,120
spice to use and how much and when you add it to the mix and all that kind of stuff.

166
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,320
There's so many parallels between all these things and just community and the fact that

167
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:04,960
we're social creatures and we seek out this communion around things that we're interested

168
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,280
in and that we find so much joy from all of this.

169
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:20,480
So with that in mind, there's the other side of the coin where it's introducing different

170
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,520
flavors can sometimes be a little tricky like you just mentioned and maybe we can draw a

171
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:36,080
very strange parallel again here between that and introducing diversity into the workplace.

172
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,880
I think everybody's acknowledged that it's a good thing.

173
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,240
It's fascinating that it took us time to realize that.

174
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,720
It seems like one of those like more obvious things that the more differences of opinion

175
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,400
and the more differences of background and culture you have, the better your product

176
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
will be.

177
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:01,080
It doesn't matter what industry you're targeting, I think in general it's always a good idea.

178
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,440
But it's taken a while and I think the tech industry maybe have taken a bit longer than

179
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,880
others but it's getting there, it's getting better.

180
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:17,460
But I've spoken to a female guest previously who came from Mexico to the US and she spoke

181
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,200
a lot about the tensions and struggles she's found while in Mexico because of the cultural

182
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,320
differences where women wasn't really seen as somebody that would go into the tech industry

183
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,960
or even science for that matter but for her she was lucky in appearance was not of that

184
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,960
thought.

185
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,240
So they actually encouraged her to pursue it.

186
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,440
And then other challenges she faced when she then moved to the United States and you've

187
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,560
raised a whole bunch of points about this so I don't want to talk about it too much.

188
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,200
I just wanted to give some context around that and then have you just speak to this

189
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:00,640
a little bit because I know that you have been affected by this maybe on a more implicit

190
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:07,920
rather than explicit situations but if you want to talk about that, just the idea of

191
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,000
adding more ingredients, adding more diversity to the mix and what the potential problems

192
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,840
there could be and how everybody can work together to make this not such a struggle

193
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,720
that it's actually something we celebrate.

194
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,840
Right.

195
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,620
So I guess I'll start with kind of my own experiences leading up to officially kind

196
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,140
of being in the tech industry and studying tech.

197
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:41,720
So I mentioned this in our kind of discussions on Polywork but I'm Puerto Rican, my parents

198
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:49,040
are Puerto Rican and kind of similar to the guest you mentioned, being Hispanic has kind

199
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,800
of its challenges in the US depending on the area, a lot of times especially.

200
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:04,080
My dad is in the army, still is, and he's kind of, we moved around a whole bunch.

201
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:10,220
I've lived around in a whole bunch of places and sometimes it's more implicit bias depending

202
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:18,360
on the kind of people that are kind of circulating in the military space and sometimes it's very

203
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,920
much explicit.

204
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,560
And those experiences aren't necessarily great but they do certainly frame the perspective

205
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:38,760
of like, hey this is, it's not the same to be Hispanic in the United States as it is

206
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:46,060
to just wake up and be, I suppose the term that they would likely use is from the United

207
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,060
States.

208
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,880
Even though Puerto Rico is a US territory, a lot of times people would talk to me as

209
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,640
if I wasn't part of the US or like that I wasn't a US citizen and I should go back

210
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
to my own country.

211
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:06,720
And it's like, okay, I'm here, I'm ready to do this, I'm ready to contribute.

212
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,960
So that's been kind of challenging.

213
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:18,400
My dad always liked to say, when it comes to that, sometimes it's just a difference

214
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,000
of like, hey I'm not, my last name's Sepulveda, my last name's not Smith or Johnson or something

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
like that.

216
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,640
And then that's not to exclude anybody, that's just to put a frame of reference of like,

217
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,480
hey, sometimes people will perceive you differently.

218
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,740
Because of where you come from, what kind of culture you bring to the table.

219
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,000
And so that was a lot of my time growing up.

220
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Like I moved around a whole bunch, I lived in Korea for six years and then lived in Hawaii

221
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,400
for another six, terrible places to live.

222
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:06,800
And from there went into tech kind of as studying computer science and then kind of taking on

223
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,440
jobs either in the university or like internships and stuff like that from there.

224
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,800
I will say definitely from that point on, it went from more of a explicit to an implicit

225
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,800
bias where people aren't necessarily going and outright saying, oh yeah, go back to your

226
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,360
country but maybe they'll go and say something that's kind of like off that makes you feel

227
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
weird.

228
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,680
And it's like, why does that make me feel weird?

229
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,720
Like where is that coming from and where is this person, do they know that this makes

230
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,200
me feel weird?

231
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,680
And that's not always an easy question to answer.

232
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,060
More recently there was an experience that I had with one of my managers at a company

233
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:55,960
previous where they would basically say, whenever I would use bigger words like an expanded

234
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,940
vernacular than just like, hey, how's it going?

235
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,160
Maybe I'll go and sprinkle some words that better illustrate what I'm saying.

236
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,080
And he would kind of make comments like, oh, those are big words.

237
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,960
And it's like, to a certain extent it's like, okay, it's not a word they use very often

238
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,240
but at the same time, am I not capable of saying those words?

239
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:28,440
Do you not believe me capable of using an expanded vernacular?

240
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,240
It's not always easy to even broach those subjects.

241
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:41,200
And I found that a lot of times it's, those implicit biases, generally speaking, I don't

242
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,520
like to go and say, oh, it is the person's fault and they likely they just don't know.

243
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,360
I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt because that ends up more often than

244
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,520
not contributing to a positive conversation about it of improvement rather than necessarily

245
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,440
being like, hey, you're like going in and throwing labels like, hey, you're racist.

246
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,160
Hey, you're this.

247
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,240
Likely that's not the person's intention.

248
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,680
And I think the discussion aspect of it is super important and kind of jumping all over

249
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,680
the place a little bit.

250
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:26,360
But generally speaking, yeah, like that's kind of my thoughts on it where it requires

251
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,000
a conversation, I'd say.

252
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,120
So how do you think we can make having that conversation easier?

253
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:47,680
As I know from the previous case that I mentioned, that was one of the challenges talking about

254
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,680
it.

255
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:58,800
There was not a lot of support and it didn't feel like you could openly talk about this.

256
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,440
She thankfully lost, I heard, at a company where that is not that much of a problem anymore

257
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,200
and it's actually encouraged.

258
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,760
Have you had experience maybe, I don't know, anywhere that you've worked or interacted

259
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:20,000
maybe at university even, where you found that people have made this like a thing where

260
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,960
they've said like, whenever you feel this, this is the avenue where you bring this up

261
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
and where we can talk about this.

262
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,520
Because I think the tricky thing with implicit bias is that, like you said, oftentimes the

263
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:40,080
person might not even know that what they're saying is making something in you feel uncomfortable

264
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,520
or not good about yourself.

265
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,040
So how do we bring that to the fore?

266
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,040
How do we allow those conversations to happen without it turning into a confrontational

267
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
thing?

268
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,120
I know it's a hard question.

269
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,400
So I think it starts with knowing what is confrontational and non-confrontational language.

270
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,360
There was a really great book that one of the other software engineers that I networked

271
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,280
with showed me non-violent communication.

272
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,840
I forget who exactly wrote the book, but it was very informative in terms of like, there

273
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:25,560
are so many things that you might bring up that may or may not be considered confrontational.

274
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,000
Just the way that you say you bring up an issue might be the difference between someone

275
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,840
taking that personally and someone taking that as a point of improvement.

276
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,920
I think there are so many other factors that go into it, like whether or not you guys are

277
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,680
part of this same culture, different cultures.

278
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,280
One example might be just with a recent networking opportunity I had.

279
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:57,840
I was the only American at that kind of event.

280
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,440
Everybody else was kind of from Europe and from Africa and all these different places,

281
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,360
and talking to them was very interesting because they were very excited to talk with me.

282
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,100
I was very excited to talk with them, but there were some times when they would say

283
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:17,160
things that it would be like, huh.

284
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,840
Sometimes with the way that we talk in the United States, we're not necessarily as direct

285
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,000
as we would like to be.

286
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,040
Just someone very directly saying something to me, it's appreciated.

287
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
I love it.

288
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,200
I think it's great, but it's like getting accustomed to the different kinds of ways

289
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,720
that people speak and what kind of cultural norms there are.

290
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,360
I think that's one huge aspect of it.

291
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:53,960
From there, I really think that nonviolent communication is an important piece.

292
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,560
Then really just identifying it as, hey, really talk about it less from, hey, this person

293
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,680
is doing something wrong, and more of, hey, this is how I'm feeling right now.

294
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:13,080
I want to understand how we can maybe improve this kind of relationship that we have and

295
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,520
putting it from a perspective of we, right?

296
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,520
It's not on the person necessarily to go and learn because a lot of times if they just

297
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,940
don't know that that's the case, there's a lot of instances where just bringing that

298
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:35,640
up for the first time may be what opens their eyes and they're like, oh, I am so sorry

299
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,560
that I did that to you.

300
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,720
You can have that discussion and move forward in a positive manner, but definitely bringing

301
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,960
it up in a constructive way of like, hey, I really appreciate the kind of feedback.

302
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,280
Let's say it's a manager and you are somebody who is experiencing that kind of implicit

303
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:04,440
bias from your manager, like my example, somebody who is talking to me as if I can't use higher

304
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:11,360
level vocabulary, like just going in and sending some time aside and being like, hey, I feel

305
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:21,080
like those comments that you made about my big words are kind of hurtful, like alternatively

306
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:31,400
maybe framing it from the perspective of like, hey, those comments are hurtful.

307
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,680
Why do you feel the need to say that?

308
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,360
Understanding the other person's perspective I think is also a big component of it because

309
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,900
it may be that they think that it's like, oh, well, that's the way my parents acted

310
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,400
with me whenever I said big words, they'd be like, oh, those are big words.

311
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,400
For them in their family, it means something, but for us outside, maybe it means something

312
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
different.

313
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,240
You really never know until you have that conversation.

314
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:06,680
A lot of times it's navigating that and just taking it with the idea of neither of you

315
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:13,560
are really trying to be malicious about things, we're just trying to solve a problem.

316
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,600
If we can approach it from that perspective, really a lot of the other things kind of fall

317
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,680
in line because at the very least you have two solution oriented people that are going

318
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,680
to accomplish this kind of improvement in the relationship between you two as opposed

319
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,500
to just coming at it from, oh, you're a racist, I can't believe that you would say something

320
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,680
like that.

321
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,320
Sure maybe those labels will make you feel better when you say them, but that won't

322
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,400
necessarily solve the problem because a lot of times if people get confronted like that,

323
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,040
they'll just like retreat and kind of maybe double down because they don't believe that

324
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,000
they're being that way.

325
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,960
There's so many different reactions to that as opposed to a more constructive and positive

326
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
approach.

327
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,840
Generally speaking, people are more willing to come to the table and meet you halfway.

328
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Yeah, I know for sure.

329
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,040
That's really good advice.

330
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,080
To switch to a different topic that's along the similar lines, but talking about the other

331
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,800
side of the things, during our conversational and poly work, I mentioned I also want to

332
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:27,120
talk about the good parts and you weren't exactly sure what I meant by that.

333
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,520
By the way, that is something that I found interesting.

334
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:39,120
In written language, we often write from our perspective and we use maybe cultural phrases

335
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,360
that we understand, not thinking what the person who's reading this might read from

336
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
that.

337
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:52,560
It's been really interesting on one of the projects we do as part of the Marseille network.

338
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:59,000
There's quite a lot of written content involved there and we have people from Brazil and places

339
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,680
like that who's also involved in it.

340
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:07,200
There's one particular person, Raphael, that I've also spoken to on the podcast previously,

341
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,160
who's amazing at the feedback he gives and the way he does it.

342
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,000
He's just really good at it.

343
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,560
He's pointed out some things in the written context where he's like, I'm not exactly sure

344
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
what you mean here.

345
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,840
Did you mean this or did you mean this thing?

346
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,240
That has opened my eyes incredibly to a lot of things that we don't necessarily think

347
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
about.

348
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,720
It's highlighted how important it is to have this diversity within a team, within a community

349
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,920
because they bring out the best in thing because now that content is so much more accessible

350
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,560
to a much wider audience because you've been much more clear about what you're actually

351
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,480
trying to say in this paragraph or in this sentence.

352
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,200
With that in mind, what I meant with the good parts is some of the things like the framework

353
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,600
wars and some of these struggles we still have in the workplace and the diversity and

354
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,080
talking and how do we talk about the difficult things in a productive manner.

355
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,720
The good parts for me is then when it comes down to making things, what is it about the

356
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,880
tech industry that made you think like, hmm, I think I'm interested in what that is.

357
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
I want to learn more about what that is and as you learn more, something about it piqued

358
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,440
your interest and you were like, yeah, I think I want to do this for my career.

359
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,360
That is the good parts.

360
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,800
What were those things about the tech industry that got you to say, yeah, this is what I

361
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,280
want to do as a career?

362
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,560
I would say one of the big things is obviously problem solving.

363
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:54,520
I love being presented some sort of challenge, some sort of feature, even some sort of bug

364
00:29:54,520 --> 00:30:02,600
where there's a problem that needs to be solved and going through the motions of like, well,

365
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
what is the current problem?

366
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,680
Do we need additional user research to solve this problem?

367
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:17,120
I love going through that process because a lot of times that research is really applicable

368
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,040
in other contexts.

369
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:25,920
You don't really think about it when you go and do just a single feature.

370
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:32,600
Maybe you want to add a chat bot or something like that to a front-facing webpage just as

371
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,880
a random example.

372
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Now you know how to do that for the next project that you're doing and you kind of learn some

373
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,040
additional aspects of maybe you need to implement it asynchronously, where now you have the

374
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,040
ability, especially in JavaScript, to understand promises and understand weights and be able

375
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:59,320
to work with more asynchronous data where each of these little experiences kind of culminate

376
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,400
into being able to solve bigger problems.

377
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:12,320
Usually a lot of the problem solving is breaking down those big problems into smaller problems.

378
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,280
With that, being able to then equate that to experiences that you had in the past of

379
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,240
being like, hey, well, I've solved four or five of these problems and I can research

380
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
this fifth one.

381
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,000
Just being able to leverage that kind of problem solving mindset on a daily basis and solve

382
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,640
problems that really help people in the long run is a huge aspect of the good parts of

383
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,520
the tech industry.

384
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,960
I'd say also collaboration.

385
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,840
I keep on going to community and collaboration, but really I think you get the most out of

386
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,280
really software building when you are able to leverage a design team, whether that's

387
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,680
a UI, UX team, a product manager, a product owner.

388
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:12,040
I've got a project right now where we're working on a CRM app.

389
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
It's currently in alpha.

390
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,120
We're still kind of working through some of the things with our initial alpha customer,

391
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,200
but we've got sales on deck.

392
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,320
We've got marketing.

393
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:29,680
We've got the product team, product owners for three different products in our company

394
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:37,760
and the UI, UX lead, and all of us together that creates such an interesting discussion

395
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,600
every week and interesting next steps all the time of like, hey, this is what we actually

396
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,280
kind of need based off of our conversations with the user, based off of our conversations

397
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,840
of what our system can handle and cannot handle.

398
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,620
This is how we need to implement it.

399
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,160
Let's go through the process of creating some of these wireframes.

400
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,040
Let's make some higher fidelity designs.

401
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:09,920
I love that aspect of it because there's so much discussion and kind of like that where

402
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,900
you likely don't have the full picture unless you talk to other people.

403
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:22,480
That's not even including like the stakeholders of the actual project, like the companies

404
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,840
or the clients that you're working with where now introducing them into the mix and understanding

405
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:37,120
their problems that also creates such an interesting experience of collaboration where everybody

406
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,040
that you work with in the tech industry, you're collaborating in some way.

407
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,280
It's not just like, oh, hey, do this.

408
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,440
Usually if you're on a team with a couple of developers, you are collaborating on something,

409
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,160
whether that's going and reviewing each other's code, pair programming, whatever the case

410
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,240
may be.

411
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,200
I can give plenty more examples, but that collaboration aspect is such a big component

412
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,640
of it that I like and I love, if you can't tell, I love talking with people.

413
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,400
It's really rewarding to be able to do that and then also leverage some technical skill

414
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,000
to be able to accomplish those kind of software solutions.

415
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,720
Yeah, that's great.

416
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
I agree 100%.

417
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,600
I love that collaborative thing as well, especially when you're working on a problem that everybody

418
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,400
is passionate about, enthusiastic about, and everybody wants to see the best possible solution

419
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:41,360
in the end of the day, I think that is like when you've really hit gold, so to speak.

420
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,960
I have one question that's going to kind of lead into a different thing I want you to

421
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,080
talk about a little bit, so let's start with the first one, which is from everything I've

422
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,560
read, I can see that you're really into D&D, Dungeons and Dragons, are there any parallels

423
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:08,240
that you can draw between the game of Dungeons and Dragons and the tech industry or working

424
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,680
on a team?

425
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,520
Yeah, certainly.

426
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,640
Most of my experience in Dungeons and Dragons is as a game master, so a lot of it is just

427
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:29,920
almost like project management where you have a clear goal of what needs to happen this

428
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,780
session and just an overarching, hey, the goal of this campaign is to do this, but then

429
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,800
you have these smaller sessions and you can equate those to sprints, where each of these

430
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,600
sprints you're trying to accomplish something in that sprint and some DMs are more rigid

431
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,280
and they say, hey, we're not leaving until we accomplish this thing.

432
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,760
That is the end of the session.

433
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,440
For me, it's a lot more flexible of like, hey, if we go through the motions and we get

434
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,560
to that point, great.

435
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,120
If we get farther than that point, fantastic.

436
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,800
If we get to a point where we're not necessarily at where I wanted to be in the story, that's

437
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
okay.

438
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,480
We'll go and plan better for the next one.

439
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,960
A lot of that is literally parallel with just agile methodology.

440
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,540
From a player perspective, a lot of that collaboration still holds where instead you each are components

441
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:33,720
of that agile methodology where let's say it's a couple of developers, a product designer,

442
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:40,180
et cetera, where maybe you're the bard, you're the paladin, you're the rogue, where each

443
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,400
of you have skills that help in different situations.

444
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,080
Maybe you have to do some sort of stealth, sneak into the castle and save the princess.

445
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,960
The rogue is better suited for that and maybe the paladin can create a distraction.

446
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,480
If you think about it from a software perspective, some people are better with front-end technologies,

447
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,200
some people are better with backend technologies, some people are better with very specific

448
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:13,320
tools and some people are better at the people side of communication and stuff like that.

449
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:20,360
A lot of that holds in Dungeons and Dragons as well where the opportunities to leverage

450
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:31,680
what your class is good at are always there and generally speaking, a good GM will take

451
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,680
the opportunities to highlight those, same with a good manager.

452
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,200
You know your people's strengths, you can help them with your weaknesses but also highlight

453
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:49,760
their strengths and have them play to their best role because obviously a paladin maybe

454
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,960
isn't the best person to be sneaking around in full plate armor, just as an example.

455
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,220
They're going to be sounding like plates that just dropped out of a pantry or something

456
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,400
like that, just like all this noise everywhere.

457
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:14,260
Those are some of the parallels but a lot of the times you can find a lot of similarities

458
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:21,160
between the two and yeah, I play it enough to where I even have a campaign in the company

459
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:27,920
that I'm currently at in Compass where a lot of the people like it's me, I'm a developer,

460
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,880
we've got some other people who are like somebody from HR, a couple product managers, a release

461
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,360
manager, all these different people who if we take out the D&D aspect of it and then

462
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,160
look at the actual team aspect of it, we've got this diverse team of individuals with

463
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,960
different experiences, different specialties in the software and also in general in their

464
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,880
career where they can leverage it.

465
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,920
I think that's some of the things that I can think of off the top of my head.

466
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,240
I can obviously go and rant on about it all day because I love Dungeons and Dragons.

467
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,440
Yeah, no, I love that.

468
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
That's wonderful.

469
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
I love that analogy.

470
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,600
It's really great.

471
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,880
That leads me into the next thing.

472
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,040
I had a look on your GitHub profile and you have a project called Sovereign of Chaos.

473
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,800
I think I'm pronouncing it correctly.

474
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,680
That sounds incredibly interesting.

475
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,400
I'd love you to dig into that some and some of the things that I'm interested in is what

476
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,440
exactly it is, how you came about to build this, and then from the larger collaborative

477
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:43,520
aspects, are you open to others using this, working it, contributing back to it, and give

478
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,560
us a nice overview of what this project is and what your goals are with it?

479
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,440
Yeah, I'll start with the naming because obviously the Sovereign of Chaos, it's like out of all

480
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,320
the things that you can name a project, why would you name it that?

481
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:05,320
That's actually a Dungeons and Dragons thing, more specifically the setting of Eberron.

482
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,960
That's one of the settings that they've published.

483
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,280
It's not just one setting that they have for Dungeons and Dragons and that's it.

484
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,960
There's a couple published ones that Wizards of the Coast, the company that owns Dungeons

485
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,520
and Dragons, have published and then obviously people can go and bring in their own homebrew

486
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
worlds.

487
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,800
One of the worlds that I really like and really resonate with me is Eberron.

488
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,840
It was written by a guy named Keith Baker.

489
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:40,680
He's really a big player with the concept of like nothing is black and white and again

490
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,320
it goes back to kind of like the same kind of concepts we've been talking about today

491
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,160
where it's not as easy as just kind of like yes or no or like it's a discussion.

492
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,000
Eberron is kind of the same way where in a lot of ways like there are spells of like

493
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,320
detect good and evil in Dungeons and Dragons where Keith Baker has said, hey, if I had

494
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,520
my way in Eberron, those wouldn't work because it's all perspective based, right?

495
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:14,320
Where somebody wouldn't necessarily like just because someone is classified as a monstrosity

496
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,240
in the system mechanically does not necessarily mean that they're evil, right?

497
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,160
And I really like that setting because of that where there's a lot of muddled grays

498
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,640
and it's kind of generally speaking like a Knorr aspect to it.

499
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,720
One of the major cities in Eberron is this place called Sharn which is this big floating

500
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:47,420
like metropolis kind of like I'm trying to think of an example like very Art Deco kind

501
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:58,600
of like 19 like roaring 20s with that mixture of like medieval fantasy and also like magic

502
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:06,600
and then also sprinkled in with some more technology aspects fueled by magic.

503
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,600
So that setting really resonated with me.

504
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:20,160
The Sovereign of Chaos is one of those kind of figures in the Dark Six of Eberron.

505
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:29,200
They're like some of the gods that people worship in that setting.

506
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,520
The Traveler as he's called is the Sovereign of Chaos.

507
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:44,440
He kind of brings along change that's kind of what his kind of what is called the underlying

508
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:52,240
concepts behind him are around like change and really with the project I decided to name

509
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,960
him that because I really wanted just like a Discord bot where I could really play around

510
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,960
with different concepts and not really have a single sort of goal and just have it be

511
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,160
like hey I want to add this feature to it great like really more of a learning experience

512
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,320
for me than necessarily like a purpose-built bot for a specific you know user flow or something

513
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:23,440
like that and that's kind of evident in the kind of features that it has like I started

514
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,760
small with some basic things like you know like an eight ball like some like a gotcha

515
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,960
item puller where like given this feed of magic items from like existing Dungeons and

516
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:46,040
Dragons publications obviously with the open game license in mind you know going and producing

517
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,720
those magic items because sometimes in the game there are instances where somebody like

518
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,360
you want to reward them with some sort of magic item but you don't necessarily know

519
00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:01,120
what to do because you weren't planning on that they they managed to to go and do something

520
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,080
that you want to reward them somehow but you have no idea so like maybe you think of oh

521
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:11,720
I want to pull uncommon magic item really a lot of the the features were also revolving

522
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:20,160
around Dungeons and Dragons and trying to help with my own game mastering initiative

523
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,640
order and skills challenges were also one thing where it kept the persistent state of

524
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:34,040
the current initiative challenges or initiative orders where essentially that kind of means

525
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,840
that there's some sort of combative encounter that is happening at that moment same thing

526
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:46,040
with skills challenges just being able to track that and having some order to a more

527
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:54,040
complex situation so maybe it's not a combat situation but a practical example might be

528
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:00,680
hey you have to escape this castle like you're not in combat yet but you are also about to

529
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:08,680
be arrested like how how does your team navigate that and attaching a sort of the reason why

530
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,200
I would attach an initiative order to that is just to give the opportunity for everybody

531
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,440
in the team to contribute because then it goes in a sequential order of turns as opposed

532
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,840
to whoever raises their hand first and blurts out what they want to do gives a lot more

533
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:34,480
opportunity for contributions as opposed to not with those features that was really the

534
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,080
kind of core concept behind it the intention was to kind of take input and provide output

535
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:50,640
through a discord server which discords python api or discord pi like it is so useful and

536
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,720
so easy to use that it felt like you know these features are just flying out of my fingers

537
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,600
into the keyboard into the repository so it was really exciting seeing it and I had it

538
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:13,280
on a server of about 50 people and that it was also doing like event reminders like kind

539
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,720
of like asynchronous stuff like I just started building on top of it and kind of having it

540
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:26,040
be a one one bot for everything for that server so people could go and set reminders go and

541
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:34,000
specific events like maybe there was some sort of like every monday we do this like

542
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,600
just sending reminders and stuff like that trying to think about what else off the top

543
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:44,360
of my head but it was just a whole bunch of features just discord oriented for that purpose

544
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:51,760
just playing around and seeing what the extent of the discord pi library could do and being

545
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,440
able to use it positively like just to improve the experience on a server so that was a lot

546
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,160
of fun with it I mean in terms of like open source like being able to fork it build on

547
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,320
it I'd say anybody that wants to can go for it it's one of the big reasons why I put it

548
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:19,040
on github in a public repository because it's just built on discord pi and a couple other

549
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,400
minor libraries that I'm pretty sure all have the same kind of licensing that it's just

550
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:33,360
kind of like hey go for it so yeah I mean anybody that wants to to pull or contribute

551
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:39,400
build on that like a lot of the concepts are were really helpful for me to learn especially

552
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:46,960
like asynchronous handling of like messages and being able to like shard and kind of basically

553
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:54,400
thread a bot so that then in the event of like multiple servers trying to add this bot

554
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:02,000
to it then you know like how do you handle that and and keep a data structure that makes

555
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:11,440
sense for like you know server a shouldn't be seeing the data for server b and you get

556
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,080
into that even more so with like I added like xp tracking and stuff like that as well so

557
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:22,160
every time somebody sent a message like you know should that xp carry over between server

558
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,200
to server those those were the kind of questions that I had so like I mean it was extremely

559
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,320
beneficial to to build and it really improved my knowledge of building software so if it

560
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,560
helps anybody like that sees it and wants to to take a look or play around with discord

561
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:46,840
pi and see what's capable say go for it right so do you it's interesting I like a lot of

562
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:53,360
the features and a lot of they make me think like do you foresee a machine learning aspect

563
00:48:53,360 --> 00:49:01,000
to this being useful say somebody is like really like dug into the open ai python stuff

564
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,920
and they're like hmm I wonder if we can add some like machine learning aspects to this

565
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:12,480
thing is that something you'd be interested in exploring I think so I think there's a

566
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:20,520
lot of benefits to machine learning like from a perspective of like just trying to improve

567
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,360
our lives instead of replace people's like jobs or anything like that there are a lot

568
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:33,240
of aspects where we we can improve people's lives with it the with discord specifically

569
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:42,320
I can see potentially like being able to process and understand what what violent communication

570
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:50,120
looks like what like derogatory communication looks like and as the you know human like

571
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,800
linguistics evolves like having something that evolves with it to be able to accurately

572
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:03,240
create a safe and comfortable environment I can see that being very useful from the

573
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:12,600
my specific bot I can see a lot of value in doing machine learning on how to properly

574
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:20,100
build an encounter so like with every monster and Dungeons and Dragons there is some sort

575
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:26,480
of challenge rating assigned to them and different skills that they can use even in the same

576
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:35,240
challenge rating and like that challenge ratings from 0 to 30 you still have a lot of aspects

577
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,240
where that challenge rating isn't exactly a full indicator of what how challenging this

578
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,840
is going to be for your party because certain classes are are you know have different abilities

579
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:52,280
that may be better suited to combat a creature than others so I can see from a machine learning

580
00:50:52,280 --> 00:51:01,080
perspective like it might be valuable to take a deeper understanding of not just the challenge

581
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,400
ratings but also the the classes and being like hey given these are the players that

582
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:11,960
are engaging with this this is a more realistic aspect of whether or not this encounter is

583
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:17,880
easy medium hard or deadly you know I can see a lot of value in that as well because

584
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:23,840
then that creates a better experience when the GM doesn't have to worry about completely

585
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:31,840
TPKing the party which is a total party kill you know or alternatively creating a big bad

586
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:36,520
and like bringing that person in only to have it be completely curb stomped by the party

587
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:43,400
because you know like based off of like even action economy you could run into those types

588
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:51,160
of issues where where one enemy is moving for every five people that are fighting against

589
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,800
it like obviously there's just like that economy of action like is going to create a problem

590
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:04,720
so machine learning to better understand that and apply those more higher level concepts

591
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,680
to Dungeons and Dragons and properly schedule an encounter and like create an encounter

592
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,600
that's valuable and meaningful and kind of accomplishes what the DM is trying to do.

593
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:20,000
I think that could be super valuable and it would be super cool if I had a tool like that.

594
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Yeah, that's great.

595
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,960
Yeah, I'm fascinated about how we can use these new found technologies and skills to

596
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:36,480
improve our lives definitely I think that is the one thing that I kind of decided to

597
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,480
do is to look at it from a positive perspective there's a lot of negativity around it and

598
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,560
I understand it but at the same time I'm like it's not going anywhere so we might as well

599
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:55,040
find ways of using it effectively to improve us as a species maybe that's maybe a little

600
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:01,360
bit going too far but maybe not maybe it's possible but at least like improving my day

601
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,880
to day like is it any way it can make me a little bit more productive take care of some

602
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,600
of the medium that I don't really enjoy doing so you know can I have something that's trained

603
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,680
to help me do these things yeah I'm trying to see it from that perspective but then keeping

604
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:23,080
ethics in mind and you know is this done like what is the potential downsides of this like

605
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:29,240
keeping that in your mind but not being a complete cynic about all of this right there's

606
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:35,680
a positive aspect to it positive aspect really to anything it's just a matter of like you

607
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,240
know especially with AI like we can find ways to incorporate it without necessarily making

608
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:48,280
people's lives worse I agree 100% yeah yeah for sure so with everything that you've experienced

609
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:55,200
in your time in tech for people just getting into the industry whether that is young folks

610
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,240
getting into it like because just straight out of school or out of university or whether

611
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,800
it's people in different stages of their lives deciding to switch careers like do you have

612
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,760
any like advice for these people like what what should they think about keep in mind

613
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:17,360
when they're just getting into this set some expectations that's more same than some of

614
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:23,280
the some of the expectations that are sometimes thrown out there when it comes to tech breaking

615
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:31,680
the problem in smaller chunks like just in general it's really easy to be intimidated

616
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,960
by wanting to learn how to program I have a couple people who have reached out even

617
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,720
in my current company where they're like hey I really want to learn how to program I want

618
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:47,560
to get to the point of developer and I'm like okay I'd be happy to help like if you have

619
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,240
some sort of learning and you're trying to understand how something works or even learn

620
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,880
how some of the things work more deeply in our company like I'd be happy to do that

621
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:05,040
and like it seems like a lot of times people get intimidated by the daunting task that

622
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,200
is learning programming because it seems like such a big mountain for a lot of people and

623
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,400
really you only get up that mountain through several smaller steps right like you know

624
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,280
even software building you know you break those problems down we've kind of mentioned

625
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:27,480
that before it's the same thing with learning software like maybe you want to be a front

626
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,440
end developer or something like that like you know there there are smaller components

627
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:37,280
to what that is like maybe you want to learn the core you break that problem from front

628
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,520
end developer and be like well no actually that means that I need to learn HTML I need

629
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,520
to learn CSS I need to learn JavaScript I need to learn React I need to learn some sort

630
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,960
of stack of like maybe the lamp stack or the the myrn stack or something like that like

631
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:59,680
break that problem down and be like okay well now I need to learn like mongo like node.js

632
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,280
react okay and then break that problem down and be like cool I want to learn the core

633
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:10,120
concepts I want to get a project going for node.js like here's my kind of goal with this

634
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:15,880
learning to be able to accomplish this and really breaking that problem down like either

635
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:23,800
if you're trying to learn on your own or in academia it's really helpful and it will

636
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:29,120
only help you in kind of the crazy projects that they kind of throw at you in academia

637
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:36,680
as well I had a class I went to Northern Arizona University and one of the professors ran a

638
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,880
course for operating systems where essentially we were building our own operating system

639
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:51,640
simulator in C and that was really one of the points where I started really breaking

640
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:57,400
down problems in the smaller chunks in a lot of ways because I had to because he would

641
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,920
just be like hey I want you to implement all these different scheduling algorithms like

642
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:08,880
shortest job first first first in first out like and it's like oh god I have two weeks

643
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:15,080
to do this and like my last project didn't do so well so it's like I've got to make

644
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:20,400
those changes I've got to improve those and then I've got to go and build the new stuff

645
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:28,240
so it's once I start understanding like how to break those problems down that really helped

646
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:36,420
me to be able to navigate challenges in the tech industry where instead of seeing it as

647
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,520
this big project now I'm like okay these are the kind of smaller steps and then even

648
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,780
smaller steps and then this is what I can do right now and this is kind of the process

649
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:51,040
to go from point A to point B to point C however many other letters that it takes to get to

650
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:58,280
the end goal so I would say that's my big advice break the problem into smaller chunks

651
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:06,120
break the learning of tech and the kind of professional development in the smaller chunks

652
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:12,880
and just take it in stride really because you may not think that you're really making

653
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,800
a lot of progress but if you look back on yourself even a month after where you were

654
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:25,160
today like chances are you've learned a lot more than you think you have you've probably

655
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,520
implemented something that you didn't think that you were able to do and you look back

656
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:35,680
and you're like wow it magnifies so much more in the context of years of experience

657
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:41,280
to where like really you know the only way you're going to get through that is not by

658
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:47,560
thinking about it from the perspective of like hey I want to get here in 10 years let's

659
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:52,440
break this problem down because then at the very least those are actionable steps that

660
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,560
your brain can actually process and be able to navigate successfully.

661
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:03,000
Yeah that's great advice and yeah I totally agree I often break it down right down to

662
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,400
what is the first variable I need to keep maybe keep some state okay cool so now how

663
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:15,600
do I set this date how do I update this date so you kind of start to really from that little

664
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:23,000
tiny variable that then builds out and out and out into solving the bigger solution so

665
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,520
in closing you've shared like many of your interests but one other one that I know that

666
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,440
you have is you're a tattoo enthusiast you know the second person in a week that I've

667
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:40,960
spoken to that has the same interest and the one thing that I always enjoy about it is

668
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,200
learning about the stories behind the tattoos because often they're super interesting so

669
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,120
is there any particular tattoo that you have that has a story of special meaning to you

670
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,640
behind it that you're wanting to share with the community?

671
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:03,520
Oh yeah totally so I kind of have my whole arm here like my right arm kind of filled

672
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,040
up with tattoos still need to finish it up like there's a couple of blank spaces and

673
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,840
I'd like to get my tattoo artist to actually fill it in and make it feel like a completed

674
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:23,960
like sleeve but there's one right here if you can see that one so for audio purposes

675
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:30,200
I'll go and describe it so essentially it's kind of a dragon face kind of in like black

676
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:37,800
and white lots of shading in it as well as some aspects of red in the eyes the dragon

677
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,400
itself is from a game called Monster Hunter Monster Hunter World to be specifically or

678
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:54,280
to be specific sorry the what's this is the final boss of their the expansion Iceborne

679
01:00:54,280 --> 01:01:01,560
in a lot of ways Monster Hunter really is like similar to the experiences I've had

680
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:07,200
where you are taking things one hunt at a time and like you're like wow this game is

681
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:13,740
really hard like I'm not sure if this is necessarily like great like sometimes it's not the easiest

682
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:18,600
game to play especially depending on what kind of weapon you choose to play that game

683
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:23,400
like whether it's a greatsword like a gunlance or something like that there's like 16 different

684
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:33,600
weapons but this was actually my first tattoo and the reason why I got it was mainly it

685
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:44,720
was something bold I wanted to have a piece on my body that was bold when people saw it

686
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,720
then they were like whoa like it's an eye-catcher immediately people are like whoa that is so

687
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:58,120
cool can I take a look at that it's a little bit vain but at the same time the other aspect

688
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,160
of it it was really my first tattoo and I was kind of on the fence for a while about

689
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:10,480
getting tattoos a lot of my upbringing was kind of like oh no well your body is a temple

690
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:17,120
you know all this sort of Christian values associated with that and ultimately getting

691
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:22,080
out and actually exploring the world myself and understanding the world and perceiving

692
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:27,320
it myself that really opened my eyes to like well you know yeah my body is a temple I should

693
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:34,040
take care of it but you know I it's my choice what I get to decorate it in my temple with

694
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:41,680
you know like if I'm you know just to kind of put it in that temple perspective so really

695
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:48,160
with that I like Monster Hunter is a game that I hold very near and dear to my heart

696
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:54,400
and Sharashvalda itself it's kind of like this world-ending worm like this kind of and

697
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:02,440
the way it's presented in the game is this kind of like almost omniscient like dragon

698
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:07,720
that is just like constantly like there's a point once you start fighting in in like

699
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:13,200
the third phase where its eyes open up and it's those same stark kind of red eyes except

700
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,440
the eyes are not tracking your player in the game they are tracking you the camera perspective

701
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,000
so regardless of where you're hitting and stuff that that camera you know it creates

702
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,560
this element of like the Shara knows what's going on almost you know like knows what's

703
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:37,200
what what this is what this is versus you know like just being in that game it kind

704
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,040
of creates this kind of fourth wall break of this dragon that is so wise and intelligent

705
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:48,600
that it can see beyond that perspective and and generally speaking that that kind of aspect

706
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:54,840
of wisdom and and stuff like that is also a big component of why I chose that monster

707
01:03:54,840 --> 01:04:00,000
out of all the monsters because I could have chosen like the the cover art dragon or something

708
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,800
like that you know I could have chosen any anything but really Sharashvalda really resonated

709
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:15,040
with me yeah that's great I knew there was a story thank you so much this was a wonderful
