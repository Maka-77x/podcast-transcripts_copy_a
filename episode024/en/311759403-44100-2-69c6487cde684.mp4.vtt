00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:10.160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.880
Welcome, Andreas, to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.720
Thanks for having me.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.720
I'm super excited.

00:18.720 --> 00:19.960
It's a huge pleasure.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.200
It's been a long time in the making.

00:21.200 --> 00:24.640
We've discussed and gone back and forth and back and forth over polywork, and finally

00:24.640 --> 00:28.440
we found a day in time that works for everybody, so I'm glad.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.360
We have business trips, am I right?

00:30.360 --> 00:35.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then the holidays and everything.

00:35.720 --> 00:40.560
To start off with, can you tell us â€“ I know you mentioned before we started that this

00:40.560 --> 00:45.000
is probably the most uncomfortable question of the bunch, so let's get that one out

00:45.000 --> 00:46.880
of the way.

00:46.880 --> 00:52.480
If you can tell us a little bit about who you are, your career, and then what gets you

00:52.480 --> 00:54.520
up in the morning.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.800
Yeah.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.800
I'm Andreas.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.680
I'm a software engineer.

00:58.680 --> 01:04.680
Currently, I'm a R&D software developer at Encompass Technologies.

01:04.680 --> 01:10.760
Basically it's an alcoholic beverage software as a service where essentially we help all

01:10.760 --> 01:16.600
three tiers of the U.S. alcohol distribution system, so whether that's people who make

01:16.600 --> 01:22.160
beer, people who distribute beer, and then people who sell beer, and obviously other

01:22.160 --> 01:26.360
wines, spirits, etc.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.640
I handle a lot of integrations with a database called DSD-Link where it's got global product

01:31.640 --> 01:38.700
data, global customer data throughout the entire Encompass network, so then as we get

01:38.700 --> 01:43.300
more partners and stuff like that on, I usually handle a lot of the integrations and stuff

01:43.300 --> 01:45.380
like that.

01:45.380 --> 01:52.640
In terms of outside of work, I've been doing programming software development for

01:52.640 --> 01:57.440
about four or five years now.

01:57.440 --> 02:04.120
When I'm not programming and stuff, I love Dungeons and Dragons.

02:04.120 --> 02:09.080
I play around with some tarot every now and then, and then also tattoos and home brewing

02:09.080 --> 02:12.240
mead actually.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.440
In general, I just like to jump around to a whole bunch of different hobbies.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.960
My partner keeps me plenty busy.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.400
She's like, oh, this is a great idea.

02:21.400 --> 02:26.520
We should go and try this, and I'm like, yeah, sure, yeah, sure, let's do it.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.640
Kind of like all over the place, but those are the main things that I usually am found

02:30.640 --> 02:31.640
doing.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.320
That sounds great.

02:33.320 --> 02:41.000
Can you explain a bit about what mead is and what the brewing process involves?

02:41.000 --> 02:48.240
With mead, a lot of people like to equate it to honey wine, so essentially the main

02:48.240 --> 02:56.240
primary ingredient that you're fermenting is honey, and the yeast consume that honey.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.080
Usually there's a couple steps where you go through primary fermentation and then you

03:00.080 --> 03:06.360
rack it into a separate container and secondary fermentation.

03:06.360 --> 03:14.160
Essentially all you're doing is having the yeast consume those different sugars, and

03:14.160 --> 03:20.640
with honey it creates a unique flavor that my partner and I really like, where it's

03:20.640 --> 03:25.520
a little bit sweeter and it's more depending on the type of honey that you use and type

03:25.520 --> 03:31.400
of yeast, it will likely be a lot closer to a white wine, like a sweeter, maybe like a

03:31.400 --> 03:35.040
Pinot Grigio.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.800
In general, it's been a lot of fun.

03:36.800 --> 03:42.760
We've done a whole bunch of different small batches of like a gallon, one of the ones

03:42.760 --> 03:47.160
that we're really proud of is one that we call the May Queen, which is basically like

03:47.160 --> 03:55.240
blood oranges, lemon zest, vanilla, and a couple more other flavors with some really

03:55.240 --> 04:00.600
high quality alpine honey from up here in Colorado.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.280
You'd be surprised how much good honey makes a difference.

04:03.280 --> 04:11.120
If you just go to the supermarket and drop honey that you pick up at the supermarket,

04:11.120 --> 04:16.500
obviously that will get you there, but we like to do smaller batches with higher quality

04:16.500 --> 04:22.880
ingredients and generally we just do it for ourselves and a couple of family members.

04:22.880 --> 04:27.040
It's a lot of fun to just be able to experiment with the different ingredients and see how

04:27.040 --> 04:29.800
the yeast takes it and creates these different flavors.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.800
Yeah, it's super cool.

04:32.800 --> 04:39.440
Honey, it makes a big difference if you get the real stuff, not the mix, the half and

04:39.440 --> 04:42.120
half that you often get at the supermarket.

04:42.120 --> 04:50.920
We have a little honey company about 10 kilometers from where I stay and when we buy honey from

04:50.920 --> 04:53.040
them, you immediately notice the difference.

04:53.040 --> 04:58.680
I can use that in my coffee and it tastes great, whereas if you use the honey from the

04:58.680 --> 05:02.280
supermarket, it's like, I'm not too sure about this.

05:02.280 --> 05:07.400
It's doubly so with me because the yeast take on a lot of those flavors or off flavors as

05:07.400 --> 05:08.400
well.

05:08.400 --> 05:14.600
If they don't have as much real sugars and stuff to consume, it's a lot harder for them

05:14.600 --> 05:20.040
to make a flavor that is actually pleasant.

05:20.040 --> 05:25.700
There's a lot of different variables that go into, obviously with brewing in general,

05:25.700 --> 05:28.920
you could create some off flavors with certain ingredients.

05:28.920 --> 05:35.280
It's just a huge balancing act, but to your point on the coffee and stuff, you can immediately

05:35.280 --> 05:36.280
tell the difference.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.800
Yeah, for sure.

05:37.800 --> 05:38.800
That's fascinating.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.800
Yeah, I can imagine how that can become a really interesting hobby.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.920
It leads into my second question that I kind of had because I picked this up when I write

05:46.920 --> 05:53.320
some stuff in your, I can't remember if it was Lictin or if it was Polywork, where you're

05:53.320 --> 06:01.320
clearly enthusiastic about beer, I think specifically, but maybe other alcohol variants as well.

06:01.320 --> 06:08.280
More than that, this idea that it brings people together, it forms community.

06:08.280 --> 06:16.880
I'm curious, the MyCMNitric podcast is part of a larger community around early stage developers.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.920
Obviously, community is very important to us and to me.

06:20.920 --> 06:25.040
I wonder, what gets you excited about community?

06:25.040 --> 06:30.380
Why are you so excited about this whole idea of beer and then the beer forming this community

06:30.380 --> 06:32.040
bringing people together?

06:32.040 --> 06:35.720
What is it about that stuff that makes you excited?

06:35.720 --> 06:41.240
Yeah, so I will say a lot of that has been kind of my exposure to the beverage industry

06:41.240 --> 06:46.720
with Encompass, which I'm really appreciative of because it really opened my eyes to just

06:46.720 --> 06:54.220
how much work goes behind the scenes to get a beer on your table or a wine or whatever

06:54.220 --> 07:01.960
the case may be, the amount of work and the amount of talent that goes into it to get

07:01.960 --> 07:06.720
a beer into the distributor and then go from the distributor to the retailer and then be

07:06.720 --> 07:09.440
able to sell that to you.

07:09.440 --> 07:14.920
There's a lot of work behind the scenes that goes into it and all of that is people who

07:14.920 --> 07:20.760
are extremely talented, extremely passionate about the beer, well, the beverages that they

07:20.760 --> 07:21.760
sell.

07:21.760 --> 07:29.640
It's the same beer, but realistically, it's so much more than that and really the more

07:29.640 --> 07:37.000
I got exposed to it, the more I realized just how much of it is community really.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.120
Whether you are making beer, distributing beer or selling it, there is a community that

07:43.120 --> 07:45.800
kind of revolves around it.

07:45.800 --> 07:50.520
There's so many different little neighborhoods and even just in the United States, but worldwide

07:50.520 --> 07:56.160
where there's a liquor store somewhere in that community and that whenever there's

07:56.160 --> 08:00.040
a party, there's something like that, usually you're going and grabbing beer, you're going

08:00.040 --> 08:02.680
and grabbing some wine, you're grabbing some cider.

08:02.680 --> 08:10.520
It's something that you don't necessarily think about, but it's what it's used for.

08:10.520 --> 08:15.920
It's used for celebrations, it's used for parties, it's used for things that bring people

08:15.920 --> 08:19.400
together and things that we can celebrate together.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.200
That's one thing that I really realized as I started working in the beverage industry

08:23.200 --> 08:30.000
with this software, that it's just such an amazing community and the more you engage

08:30.000 --> 08:33.440
with it, the more you get out of it.

08:33.440 --> 08:37.960
People are always willing to talk to you about brewing, regardless of what kind of brewing

08:37.960 --> 08:43.800
it is, you can get along with somebody who has only ever brewed beer in their life.

08:43.800 --> 08:50.040
If you just say, hey, I do cider, I do mead, I do this other weird thing that I decided

08:50.040 --> 08:56.840
to ferment this very specific plant or something like that, at the very least you have that

08:56.840 --> 09:02.800
kind of common bond where you're going and trying to make something new and pleasant

09:02.800 --> 09:07.040
that's like at the end of the day, you're sharing that with somebody.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.640
You're not necessarily just sitting around doing that by yourself, at least you've got

09:10.640 --> 09:14.440
a partner, you've got some friends that you want to share that with.

09:14.440 --> 09:21.600
Even if that's online, there's so much to it that is just community that people don't

09:21.600 --> 09:23.760
necessarily realize.

09:23.760 --> 09:34.360
For me, that's really the excitement aspect of it where I love contributing to that community

09:34.360 --> 09:42.160
because at the end of the day, it's such a big component of the human experience, I would

09:42.160 --> 09:48.160
say, because it's just been alcohol fermented beverages have been around as long as you

09:48.160 --> 09:52.440
can probably remember.

09:52.440 --> 09:57.240
It's something that we sometimes take for granted, but it's a valuable part of what

09:57.240 --> 09:58.840
makes a community.

09:58.840 --> 10:07.760
Yeah, agreed, and I think there's parallels to be drawn there to software.

10:07.760 --> 10:13.240
If you build, if you write a little library or a little tool or something, it's always

10:13.240 --> 10:16.720
great to have a community to go to and to say, hey, look at this thing I made and people

10:16.720 --> 10:21.680
are like, that's really cool and you get that feedback and you get that even when people

10:21.680 --> 10:25.360
tell you, oh, you know what, there's this way that you can make this even better.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.760
I think it's the same thing when it comes to brewing.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.320
If you share your brewing recipe, somebody might say, you know what, I did something

10:32.320 --> 10:36.960
similar and I did this little difference and it made such a big, like you have this experience

10:36.960 --> 10:42.840
with these different honeys and that having the real deal coming from a craft place or

10:42.840 --> 10:47.000
something is so much better than the honey you get at the supermarket.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.280
You might get somebody in the community who says, I'm making me, but I just can't quite

10:51.280 --> 10:54.040
get there and you say, what honey are you using?

10:54.040 --> 10:57.720
And they're like, oh, I'm using this thing from this place and you're like, you should

10:57.720 --> 11:02.520
try and get it from a local farmer or something like somebody that works with bees because

11:02.520 --> 11:04.360
that's going to make all the difference.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.880
I think that knowledge sharing is a big part of it as well.

11:07.880 --> 11:08.880
Yeah.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.640
I'll give another example on that.

11:10.640 --> 11:17.480
It's like the usage of what kind of parts of the lemon to use in like a meat or something

11:17.480 --> 11:22.800
like that because then a lot of times the acidity of things like lemons and stuff may

11:22.800 --> 11:29.600
be adverse towards yeast depending on the other things that you put in there.

11:29.600 --> 11:35.840
You can do stuff like add lipids to the yeast so that then it kind of strengthens their

11:35.840 --> 11:36.840
cellular walls.

11:36.840 --> 11:42.560
We're getting way into the very specifics there, but I have a lot of good friends that

11:42.560 --> 11:49.840
are fermentation science majors, which I didn't know was a thing until I got to Encompass

11:49.840 --> 11:55.880
where they kind of gave me that kind of feedback where like, hey, if you're trying to use

11:55.880 --> 12:04.520
more acidic, less than ideal flavors that would be great for us to consume but not necessarily

12:04.520 --> 12:12.920
ideal for the yeast to live in and produce alcohol in, you could potentially add some

12:12.920 --> 12:21.160
additional things to strengthen the yeast and build up their tolerance, so to speak.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.780
There's different parts of the lemon even.

12:23.780 --> 12:28.680
We use like the pith and other parts of it instead of just straight up the lemon pieces

12:28.680 --> 12:32.960
where you still get that kind of lemon flavor without necessarily introducing as much of

12:32.960 --> 12:33.960
the acidity.

12:33.960 --> 12:34.960
Yeah.

12:34.960 --> 12:35.960
I understand.

12:35.960 --> 12:46.280
It sounds very similar to cooking, also knowing what parts of the vegetable or fruit or whatever

12:46.280 --> 12:53.120
spice to use and how much and when you add it to the mix and all that kind of stuff.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.320
There's so many parallels between all these things and just community and the fact that

12:57.320 --> 13:04.960
we're social creatures and we seek out this communion around things that we're interested

13:04.960 --> 13:09.280
in and that we find so much joy from all of this.

13:09.280 --> 13:20.480
So with that in mind, there's the other side of the coin where it's introducing different

13:20.480 --> 13:26.520
flavors can sometimes be a little tricky like you just mentioned and maybe we can draw a

13:26.520 --> 13:36.080
very strange parallel again here between that and introducing diversity into the workplace.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.880
I think everybody's acknowledged that it's a good thing.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.240
It's fascinating that it took us time to realize that.

13:42.240 --> 13:47.720
It seems like one of those like more obvious things that the more differences of opinion

13:47.720 --> 13:51.400
and the more differences of background and culture you have, the better your product

13:51.400 --> 13:52.400
will be.

13:52.400 --> 14:01.080
It doesn't matter what industry you're targeting, I think in general it's always a good idea.

14:01.080 --> 14:05.440
But it's taken a while and I think the tech industry maybe have taken a bit longer than

14:05.440 --> 14:09.880
others but it's getting there, it's getting better.

14:09.880 --> 14:17.460
But I've spoken to a female guest previously who came from Mexico to the US and she spoke

14:17.460 --> 14:23.200
a lot about the tensions and struggles she's found while in Mexico because of the cultural

14:23.200 --> 14:30.320
differences where women wasn't really seen as somebody that would go into the tech industry

14:30.320 --> 14:35.960
or even science for that matter but for her she was lucky in appearance was not of that

14:35.960 --> 14:36.960
thought.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.240
So they actually encouraged her to pursue it.

14:40.240 --> 14:46.440
And then other challenges she faced when she then moved to the United States and you've

14:46.440 --> 14:49.560
raised a whole bunch of points about this so I don't want to talk about it too much.

14:49.560 --> 14:53.200
I just wanted to give some context around that and then have you just speak to this

14:53.200 --> 15:00.640
a little bit because I know that you have been affected by this maybe on a more implicit

15:00.640 --> 15:07.920
rather than explicit situations but if you want to talk about that, just the idea of

15:07.920 --> 15:14.000
adding more ingredients, adding more diversity to the mix and what the potential problems

15:14.000 --> 15:21.840
there could be and how everybody can work together to make this not such a struggle

15:21.840 --> 15:24.720
that it's actually something we celebrate.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.840
Right.

15:26.840 --> 15:31.620
So I guess I'll start with kind of my own experiences leading up to officially kind

15:31.620 --> 15:35.140
of being in the tech industry and studying tech.

15:35.140 --> 15:41.720
So I mentioned this in our kind of discussions on Polywork but I'm Puerto Rican, my parents

15:41.720 --> 15:49.040
are Puerto Rican and kind of similar to the guest you mentioned, being Hispanic has kind

15:49.040 --> 15:55.800
of its challenges in the US depending on the area, a lot of times especially.

15:55.800 --> 16:04.080
My dad is in the army, still is, and he's kind of, we moved around a whole bunch.

16:04.080 --> 16:10.220
I've lived around in a whole bunch of places and sometimes it's more implicit bias depending

16:10.220 --> 16:18.360
on the kind of people that are kind of circulating in the military space and sometimes it's very

16:18.360 --> 16:21.920
much explicit.

16:21.920 --> 16:27.560
And those experiences aren't necessarily great but they do certainly frame the perspective

16:27.560 --> 16:38.760
of like, hey this is, it's not the same to be Hispanic in the United States as it is

16:38.760 --> 16:46.060
to just wake up and be, I suppose the term that they would likely use is from the United

16:46.060 --> 16:47.060
States.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.880
Even though Puerto Rico is a US territory, a lot of times people would talk to me as

16:50.880 --> 16:56.640
if I wasn't part of the US or like that I wasn't a US citizen and I should go back

16:56.640 --> 16:57.640
to my own country.

16:57.640 --> 17:06.720
And it's like, okay, I'm here, I'm ready to do this, I'm ready to contribute.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.960
So that's been kind of challenging.

17:09.960 --> 17:18.400
My dad always liked to say, when it comes to that, sometimes it's just a difference

17:18.400 --> 17:25.000
of like, hey I'm not, my last name's Sepulveda, my last name's not Smith or Johnson or something

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
like that.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.640
And then that's not to exclude anybody, that's just to put a frame of reference of like,

17:31.640 --> 17:35.480
hey, sometimes people will perceive you differently.

17:35.480 --> 17:41.740
Because of where you come from, what kind of culture you bring to the table.

17:41.740 --> 17:46.000
And so that was a lot of my time growing up.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
Like I moved around a whole bunch, I lived in Korea for six years and then lived in Hawaii

17:51.000 --> 17:55.400
for another six, terrible places to live.

17:55.400 --> 18:06.800
And from there went into tech kind of as studying computer science and then kind of taking on

18:06.800 --> 18:12.440
jobs either in the university or like internships and stuff like that from there.

18:12.440 --> 18:18.800
I will say definitely from that point on, it went from more of a explicit to an implicit

18:18.800 --> 18:22.800
bias where people aren't necessarily going and outright saying, oh yeah, go back to your

18:22.800 --> 18:26.360
country but maybe they'll go and say something that's kind of like off that makes you feel

18:26.360 --> 18:27.360
weird.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.680
And it's like, why does that make me feel weird?

18:29.680 --> 18:35.720
Like where is that coming from and where is this person, do they know that this makes

18:35.720 --> 18:38.200
me feel weird?

18:38.200 --> 18:42.680
And that's not always an easy question to answer.

18:42.680 --> 18:49.060
More recently there was an experience that I had with one of my managers at a company

18:49.060 --> 18:55.960
previous where they would basically say, whenever I would use bigger words like an expanded

18:55.960 --> 18:58.940
vernacular than just like, hey, how's it going?

18:58.940 --> 19:03.160
Maybe I'll go and sprinkle some words that better illustrate what I'm saying.

19:03.160 --> 19:07.080
And he would kind of make comments like, oh, those are big words.

19:07.080 --> 19:13.960
And it's like, to a certain extent it's like, okay, it's not a word they use very often

19:13.960 --> 19:20.240
but at the same time, am I not capable of saying those words?

19:20.240 --> 19:28.440
Do you not believe me capable of using an expanded vernacular?

19:28.440 --> 19:34.240
It's not always easy to even broach those subjects.

19:34.240 --> 19:41.200
And I found that a lot of times it's, those implicit biases, generally speaking, I don't

19:41.200 --> 19:47.520
like to go and say, oh, it is the person's fault and they likely they just don't know.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.360
I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt because that ends up more often than

19:51.360 --> 19:58.520
not contributing to a positive conversation about it of improvement rather than necessarily

19:58.520 --> 20:04.440
being like, hey, you're like going in and throwing labels like, hey, you're racist.

20:04.440 --> 20:08.160
Hey, you're this.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.240
Likely that's not the person's intention.

20:10.240 --> 20:16.680
And I think the discussion aspect of it is super important and kind of jumping all over

20:16.680 --> 20:17.680
the place a little bit.

20:17.680 --> 20:26.360
But generally speaking, yeah, like that's kind of my thoughts on it where it requires

20:26.360 --> 20:30.000
a conversation, I'd say.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.120
So how do you think we can make having that conversation easier?

20:35.120 --> 20:47.680
As I know from the previous case that I mentioned, that was one of the challenges talking about

20:47.680 --> 20:50.680
it.

20:50.680 --> 20:58.800
There was not a lot of support and it didn't feel like you could openly talk about this.

20:58.800 --> 21:03.440
She thankfully lost, I heard, at a company where that is not that much of a problem anymore

21:03.440 --> 21:07.200
and it's actually encouraged.

21:07.200 --> 21:12.760
Have you had experience maybe, I don't know, anywhere that you've worked or interacted

21:12.760 --> 21:20.000
maybe at university even, where you found that people have made this like a thing where

21:20.000 --> 21:26.960
they've said like, whenever you feel this, this is the avenue where you bring this up

21:26.960 --> 21:28.480
and where we can talk about this.

21:28.480 --> 21:33.520
Because I think the tricky thing with implicit bias is that, like you said, oftentimes the

21:33.520 --> 21:40.080
person might not even know that what they're saying is making something in you feel uncomfortable

21:40.080 --> 21:43.520
or not good about yourself.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.040
So how do we bring that to the fore?

21:45.040 --> 21:49.040
How do we allow those conversations to happen without it turning into a confrontational

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
thing?

21:50.040 --> 21:53.120
I know it's a hard question.

21:53.120 --> 22:00.400
So I think it starts with knowing what is confrontational and non-confrontational language.

22:00.400 --> 22:05.360
There was a really great book that one of the other software engineers that I networked

22:05.360 --> 22:11.280
with showed me non-violent communication.

22:11.280 --> 22:15.840
I forget who exactly wrote the book, but it was very informative in terms of like, there

22:15.840 --> 22:25.560
are so many things that you might bring up that may or may not be considered confrontational.

22:25.560 --> 22:30.000
Just the way that you say you bring up an issue might be the difference between someone

22:30.000 --> 22:34.840
taking that personally and someone taking that as a point of improvement.

22:34.840 --> 22:39.920
I think there are so many other factors that go into it, like whether or not you guys are

22:39.920 --> 22:44.680
part of this same culture, different cultures.

22:44.680 --> 22:50.280
One example might be just with a recent networking opportunity I had.

22:50.280 --> 22:57.840
I was the only American at that kind of event.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.440
Everybody else was kind of from Europe and from Africa and all these different places,

23:01.440 --> 23:06.360
and talking to them was very interesting because they were very excited to talk with me.

23:06.360 --> 23:10.100
I was very excited to talk with them, but there were some times when they would say

23:10.100 --> 23:17.160
things that it would be like, huh.

23:17.160 --> 23:21.840
Sometimes with the way that we talk in the United States, we're not necessarily as direct

23:21.840 --> 23:27.000
as we would like to be.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.040
Just someone very directly saying something to me, it's appreciated.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.040
I love it.

23:33.040 --> 23:38.200
I think it's great, but it's like getting accustomed to the different kinds of ways

23:38.200 --> 23:41.720
that people speak and what kind of cultural norms there are.

23:41.720 --> 23:46.360
I think that's one huge aspect of it.

23:46.360 --> 23:53.960
From there, I really think that nonviolent communication is an important piece.

23:53.960 --> 24:00.560
Then really just identifying it as, hey, really talk about it less from, hey, this person

24:00.560 --> 24:05.680
is doing something wrong, and more of, hey, this is how I'm feeling right now.

24:05.680 --> 24:13.080
I want to understand how we can maybe improve this kind of relationship that we have and

24:13.080 --> 24:15.520
putting it from a perspective of we, right?

24:15.520 --> 24:22.520
It's not on the person necessarily to go and learn because a lot of times if they just

24:22.520 --> 24:26.940
don't know that that's the case, there's a lot of instances where just bringing that

24:26.940 --> 24:35.640
up for the first time may be what opens their eyes and they're like, oh, I am so sorry

24:35.640 --> 24:38.560
that I did that to you.

24:38.560 --> 24:43.720
You can have that discussion and move forward in a positive manner, but definitely bringing

24:43.720 --> 24:48.960
it up in a constructive way of like, hey, I really appreciate the kind of feedback.

24:48.960 --> 24:55.280
Let's say it's a manager and you are somebody who is experiencing that kind of implicit

24:55.280 --> 25:04.440
bias from your manager, like my example, somebody who is talking to me as if I can't use higher

25:04.440 --> 25:11.360
level vocabulary, like just going in and sending some time aside and being like, hey, I feel

25:11.360 --> 25:21.080
like those comments that you made about my big words are kind of hurtful, like alternatively

25:21.080 --> 25:31.400
maybe framing it from the perspective of like, hey, those comments are hurtful.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.680
Why do you feel the need to say that?

25:35.680 --> 25:39.360
Understanding the other person's perspective I think is also a big component of it because

25:39.360 --> 25:43.900
it may be that they think that it's like, oh, well, that's the way my parents acted

25:43.900 --> 25:49.400
with me whenever I said big words, they'd be like, oh, those are big words.

25:49.400 --> 25:53.400
For them in their family, it means something, but for us outside, maybe it means something

25:53.400 --> 25:54.400
different.

25:54.400 --> 25:58.240
You really never know until you have that conversation.

25:58.240 --> 26:06.680
A lot of times it's navigating that and just taking it with the idea of neither of you

26:06.680 --> 26:13.560
are really trying to be malicious about things, we're just trying to solve a problem.

26:13.560 --> 26:17.600
If we can approach it from that perspective, really a lot of the other things kind of fall

26:17.600 --> 26:23.680
in line because at the very least you have two solution oriented people that are going

26:23.680 --> 26:29.680
to accomplish this kind of improvement in the relationship between you two as opposed

26:29.680 --> 26:33.500
to just coming at it from, oh, you're a racist, I can't believe that you would say something

26:33.500 --> 26:37.680
like that.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.320
Sure maybe those labels will make you feel better when you say them, but that won't

26:41.320 --> 26:46.400
necessarily solve the problem because a lot of times if people get confronted like that,

26:46.400 --> 26:51.040
they'll just like retreat and kind of maybe double down because they don't believe that

26:51.040 --> 26:54.000
they're being that way.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.960
There's so many different reactions to that as opposed to a more constructive and positive

26:58.960 --> 26:59.960
approach.

26:59.960 --> 27:03.840
Generally speaking, people are more willing to come to the table and meet you halfway.

27:03.840 --> 27:06.840
Yeah, I know for sure.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.040
That's really good advice.

27:09.040 --> 27:14.080
To switch to a different topic that's along the similar lines, but talking about the other

27:14.080 --> 27:20.800
side of the things, during our conversational and poly work, I mentioned I also want to

27:20.800 --> 27:27.120
talk about the good parts and you weren't exactly sure what I meant by that.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.520
By the way, that is something that I found interesting.

27:30.520 --> 27:39.120
In written language, we often write from our perspective and we use maybe cultural phrases

27:39.120 --> 27:45.360
that we understand, not thinking what the person who's reading this might read from

27:45.360 --> 27:46.360
that.

27:46.360 --> 27:52.560
It's been really interesting on one of the projects we do as part of the Marseille network.

27:52.560 --> 27:59.000
There's quite a lot of written content involved there and we have people from Brazil and places

27:59.000 --> 28:01.680
like that who's also involved in it.

28:01.680 --> 28:07.200
There's one particular person, Raphael, that I've also spoken to on the podcast previously,

28:07.200 --> 28:12.160
who's amazing at the feedback he gives and the way he does it.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.000
He's just really good at it.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.560
He's pointed out some things in the written context where he's like, I'm not exactly sure

28:18.560 --> 28:19.560
what you mean here.

28:19.560 --> 28:23.840
Did you mean this or did you mean this thing?

28:23.840 --> 28:28.240
That has opened my eyes incredibly to a lot of things that we don't necessarily think

28:28.240 --> 28:29.480
about.

28:29.480 --> 28:35.720
It's highlighted how important it is to have this diversity within a team, within a community

28:35.720 --> 28:40.920
because they bring out the best in thing because now that content is so much more accessible

28:40.920 --> 28:46.560
to a much wider audience because you've been much more clear about what you're actually

28:46.560 --> 28:51.480
trying to say in this paragraph or in this sentence.

28:51.480 --> 28:58.200
With that in mind, what I meant with the good parts is some of the things like the framework

28:58.200 --> 29:04.600
wars and some of these struggles we still have in the workplace and the diversity and

29:04.600 --> 29:10.080
talking and how do we talk about the difficult things in a productive manner.

29:10.080 --> 29:16.720
The good parts for me is then when it comes down to making things, what is it about the

29:16.720 --> 29:22.880
tech industry that made you think like, hmm, I think I'm interested in what that is.

29:22.880 --> 29:27.840
I want to learn more about what that is and as you learn more, something about it piqued

29:27.840 --> 29:33.440
your interest and you were like, yeah, I think I want to do this for my career.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.360
That is the good parts.

29:35.360 --> 29:39.800
What were those things about the tech industry that got you to say, yeah, this is what I

29:39.800 --> 29:44.280
want to do as a career?

29:44.280 --> 29:48.560
I would say one of the big things is obviously problem solving.

29:48.560 --> 29:54.520
I love being presented some sort of challenge, some sort of feature, even some sort of bug

29:54.520 --> 30:02.600
where there's a problem that needs to be solved and going through the motions of like, well,

30:02.600 --> 30:03.600
what is the current problem?

30:03.600 --> 30:08.680
Do we need additional user research to solve this problem?

30:08.680 --> 30:17.120
I love going through that process because a lot of times that research is really applicable

30:17.120 --> 30:19.040
in other contexts.

30:19.040 --> 30:25.920
You don't really think about it when you go and do just a single feature.

30:25.920 --> 30:32.600
Maybe you want to add a chat bot or something like that to a front-facing webpage just as

30:32.600 --> 30:35.880
a random example.

30:35.880 --> 30:40.880
Now you know how to do that for the next project that you're doing and you kind of learn some

30:40.880 --> 30:47.040
additional aspects of maybe you need to implement it asynchronously, where now you have the

30:47.040 --> 30:53.040
ability, especially in JavaScript, to understand promises and understand weights and be able

30:53.040 --> 30:59.320
to work with more asynchronous data where each of these little experiences kind of culminate

30:59.320 --> 31:04.400
into being able to solve bigger problems.

31:04.400 --> 31:12.320
Usually a lot of the problem solving is breaking down those big problems into smaller problems.

31:12.320 --> 31:19.280
With that, being able to then equate that to experiences that you had in the past of

31:19.280 --> 31:24.240
being like, hey, well, I've solved four or five of these problems and I can research

31:24.240 --> 31:26.880
this fifth one.

31:26.880 --> 31:32.000
Just being able to leverage that kind of problem solving mindset on a daily basis and solve

31:32.000 --> 31:38.640
problems that really help people in the long run is a huge aspect of the good parts of

31:38.640 --> 31:41.520
the tech industry.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.960
I'd say also collaboration.

31:43.960 --> 31:50.840
I keep on going to community and collaboration, but really I think you get the most out of

31:50.840 --> 31:57.280
really software building when you are able to leverage a design team, whether that's

31:57.280 --> 32:03.680
a UI, UX team, a product manager, a product owner.

32:03.680 --> 32:12.040
I've got a project right now where we're working on a CRM app.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.040
It's currently in alpha.

32:13.040 --> 32:17.120
We're still kind of working through some of the things with our initial alpha customer,

32:17.120 --> 32:20.200
but we've got sales on deck.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.320
We've got marketing.

32:21.320 --> 32:29.680
We've got the product team, product owners for three different products in our company

32:29.680 --> 32:37.760
and the UI, UX lead, and all of us together that creates such an interesting discussion

32:37.760 --> 32:44.600
every week and interesting next steps all the time of like, hey, this is what we actually

32:44.600 --> 32:50.280
kind of need based off of our conversations with the user, based off of our conversations

32:50.280 --> 32:54.840
of what our system can handle and cannot handle.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.620
This is how we need to implement it.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.160
Let's go through the process of creating some of these wireframes.

32:59.160 --> 33:02.040
Let's make some higher fidelity designs.

33:02.040 --> 33:09.920
I love that aspect of it because there's so much discussion and kind of like that where

33:09.920 --> 33:15.900
you likely don't have the full picture unless you talk to other people.

33:15.900 --> 33:22.480
That's not even including like the stakeholders of the actual project, like the companies

33:22.480 --> 33:28.840
or the clients that you're working with where now introducing them into the mix and understanding

33:28.840 --> 33:37.120
their problems that also creates such an interesting experience of collaboration where everybody

33:37.120 --> 33:43.040
that you work with in the tech industry, you're collaborating in some way.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.280
It's not just like, oh, hey, do this.

33:46.280 --> 33:50.440
Usually if you're on a team with a couple of developers, you are collaborating on something,

33:50.440 --> 33:54.160
whether that's going and reviewing each other's code, pair programming, whatever the case

33:54.160 --> 33:56.240
may be.

33:56.240 --> 34:02.200
I can give plenty more examples, but that collaboration aspect is such a big component

34:02.200 --> 34:07.640
of it that I like and I love, if you can't tell, I love talking with people.

34:07.640 --> 34:13.400
It's really rewarding to be able to do that and then also leverage some technical skill

34:13.400 --> 34:18.000
to be able to accomplish those kind of software solutions.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.720
Yeah, that's great.

34:19.720 --> 34:21.720
I agree 100%.

34:21.720 --> 34:28.600
I love that collaborative thing as well, especially when you're working on a problem that everybody

34:28.600 --> 34:34.400
is passionate about, enthusiastic about, and everybody wants to see the best possible solution

34:34.400 --> 34:41.360
in the end of the day, I think that is like when you've really hit gold, so to speak.

34:41.360 --> 34:44.960
I have one question that's going to kind of lead into a different thing I want you to

34:44.960 --> 34:51.080
talk about a little bit, so let's start with the first one, which is from everything I've

34:51.080 --> 34:58.560
read, I can see that you're really into D&D, Dungeons and Dragons, are there any parallels

34:58.560 --> 35:08.240
that you can draw between the game of Dungeons and Dragons and the tech industry or working

35:08.240 --> 35:10.680
on a team?

35:10.680 --> 35:15.520
Yeah, certainly.

35:15.520 --> 35:21.640
Most of my experience in Dungeons and Dragons is as a game master, so a lot of it is just

35:21.640 --> 35:29.920
almost like project management where you have a clear goal of what needs to happen this

35:29.920 --> 35:36.780
session and just an overarching, hey, the goal of this campaign is to do this, but then

35:36.780 --> 35:41.800
you have these smaller sessions and you can equate those to sprints, where each of these

35:41.800 --> 35:48.600
sprints you're trying to accomplish something in that sprint and some DMs are more rigid

35:48.600 --> 35:52.280
and they say, hey, we're not leaving until we accomplish this thing.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.760
That is the end of the session.

35:53.760 --> 36:00.440
For me, it's a lot more flexible of like, hey, if we go through the motions and we get

36:00.440 --> 36:01.560
to that point, great.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.120
If we get farther than that point, fantastic.

36:04.120 --> 36:09.800
If we get to a point where we're not necessarily at where I wanted to be in the story, that's

36:09.800 --> 36:10.800
okay.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.480
We'll go and plan better for the next one.

36:13.480 --> 36:19.960
A lot of that is literally parallel with just agile methodology.

36:19.960 --> 36:26.540
From a player perspective, a lot of that collaboration still holds where instead you each are components

36:26.540 --> 36:33.720
of that agile methodology where let's say it's a couple of developers, a product designer,

36:33.720 --> 36:40.180
et cetera, where maybe you're the bard, you're the paladin, you're the rogue, where each

36:40.180 --> 36:44.400
of you have skills that help in different situations.

36:44.400 --> 36:50.080
Maybe you have to do some sort of stealth, sneak into the castle and save the princess.

36:50.080 --> 36:54.960
The rogue is better suited for that and maybe the paladin can create a distraction.

36:54.960 --> 37:00.480
If you think about it from a software perspective, some people are better with front-end technologies,

37:00.480 --> 37:05.200
some people are better with backend technologies, some people are better with very specific

37:05.200 --> 37:13.320
tools and some people are better at the people side of communication and stuff like that.

37:13.320 --> 37:20.360
A lot of that holds in Dungeons and Dragons as well where the opportunities to leverage

37:20.360 --> 37:31.680
what your class is good at are always there and generally speaking, a good GM will take

37:31.680 --> 37:38.680
the opportunities to highlight those, same with a good manager.

37:38.680 --> 37:42.200
You know your people's strengths, you can help them with your weaknesses but also highlight

37:42.200 --> 37:49.760
their strengths and have them play to their best role because obviously a paladin maybe

37:49.760 --> 37:54.960
isn't the best person to be sneaking around in full plate armor, just as an example.

37:54.960 --> 38:01.220
They're going to be sounding like plates that just dropped out of a pantry or something

38:01.220 --> 38:06.400
like that, just like all this noise everywhere.

38:06.400 --> 38:14.260
Those are some of the parallels but a lot of the times you can find a lot of similarities

38:14.260 --> 38:21.160
between the two and yeah, I play it enough to where I even have a campaign in the company

38:21.160 --> 38:27.920
that I'm currently at in Compass where a lot of the people like it's me, I'm a developer,

38:27.920 --> 38:33.880
we've got some other people who are like somebody from HR, a couple product managers, a release

38:33.880 --> 38:40.360
manager, all these different people who if we take out the D&D aspect of it and then

38:40.360 --> 38:45.160
look at the actual team aspect of it, we've got this diverse team of individuals with

38:45.160 --> 38:50.960
different experiences, different specialties in the software and also in general in their

38:50.960 --> 38:55.880
career where they can leverage it.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.920
I think that's some of the things that I can think of off the top of my head.

38:59.920 --> 39:04.240
I can obviously go and rant on about it all day because I love Dungeons and Dragons.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.440
Yeah, no, I love that.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.440
That's wonderful.

39:07.440 --> 39:08.440
I love that analogy.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.600
It's really great.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.880
That leads me into the next thing.

39:11.880 --> 39:18.040
I had a look on your GitHub profile and you have a project called Sovereign of Chaos.

39:18.040 --> 39:21.800
I think I'm pronouncing it correctly.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.680
That sounds incredibly interesting.

39:23.680 --> 39:28.400
I'd love you to dig into that some and some of the things that I'm interested in is what

39:28.400 --> 39:34.440
exactly it is, how you came about to build this, and then from the larger collaborative

39:34.440 --> 39:43.520
aspects, are you open to others using this, working it, contributing back to it, and give

39:43.520 --> 39:48.560
us a nice overview of what this project is and what your goals are with it?

39:48.560 --> 39:53.440
Yeah, I'll start with the naming because obviously the Sovereign of Chaos, it's like out of all

39:53.440 --> 39:58.320
the things that you can name a project, why would you name it that?

39:58.320 --> 40:05.320
That's actually a Dungeons and Dragons thing, more specifically the setting of Eberron.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.960
That's one of the settings that they've published.

40:07.960 --> 40:12.280
It's not just one setting that they have for Dungeons and Dragons and that's it.

40:12.280 --> 40:15.960
There's a couple published ones that Wizards of the Coast, the company that owns Dungeons

40:15.960 --> 40:20.520
and Dragons, have published and then obviously people can go and bring in their own homebrew

40:20.520 --> 40:21.520
worlds.

40:21.520 --> 40:26.800
One of the worlds that I really like and really resonate with me is Eberron.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.840
It was written by a guy named Keith Baker.

40:30.840 --> 40:40.680
He's really a big player with the concept of like nothing is black and white and again

40:40.680 --> 40:45.320
it goes back to kind of like the same kind of concepts we've been talking about today

40:45.320 --> 40:51.160
where it's not as easy as just kind of like yes or no or like it's a discussion.

40:51.160 --> 40:56.000
Eberron is kind of the same way where in a lot of ways like there are spells of like

40:56.000 --> 41:01.320
detect good and evil in Dungeons and Dragons where Keith Baker has said, hey, if I had

41:01.320 --> 41:06.520
my way in Eberron, those wouldn't work because it's all perspective based, right?

41:06.520 --> 41:14.320
Where somebody wouldn't necessarily like just because someone is classified as a monstrosity

41:14.320 --> 41:20.240
in the system mechanically does not necessarily mean that they're evil, right?

41:20.240 --> 41:25.160
And I really like that setting because of that where there's a lot of muddled grays

41:25.160 --> 41:31.640
and it's kind of generally speaking like a Knorr aspect to it.

41:31.640 --> 41:37.720
One of the major cities in Eberron is this place called Sharn which is this big floating

41:37.720 --> 41:47.420
like metropolis kind of like I'm trying to think of an example like very Art Deco kind

41:47.420 --> 41:58.600
of like 19 like roaring 20s with that mixture of like medieval fantasy and also like magic

41:58.600 --> 42:06.600
and then also sprinkled in with some more technology aspects fueled by magic.

42:06.600 --> 42:10.600
So that setting really resonated with me.

42:10.600 --> 42:20.160
The Sovereign of Chaos is one of those kind of figures in the Dark Six of Eberron.

42:20.160 --> 42:29.200
They're like some of the gods that people worship in that setting.

42:29.200 --> 42:32.520
The Traveler as he's called is the Sovereign of Chaos.

42:32.520 --> 42:44.440
He kind of brings along change that's kind of what his kind of what is called the underlying

42:44.440 --> 42:52.240
concepts behind him are around like change and really with the project I decided to name

42:52.240 --> 42:58.960
him that because I really wanted just like a Discord bot where I could really play around

42:58.960 --> 43:04.960
with different concepts and not really have a single sort of goal and just have it be

43:04.960 --> 43:10.160
like hey I want to add this feature to it great like really more of a learning experience

43:10.160 --> 43:17.320
for me than necessarily like a purpose-built bot for a specific you know user flow or something

43:17.320 --> 43:23.440
like that and that's kind of evident in the kind of features that it has like I started

43:23.440 --> 43:29.760
small with some basic things like you know like an eight ball like some like a gotcha

43:29.760 --> 43:37.960
item puller where like given this feed of magic items from like existing Dungeons and

43:37.960 --> 43:46.040
Dragons publications obviously with the open game license in mind you know going and producing

43:46.040 --> 43:50.720
those magic items because sometimes in the game there are instances where somebody like

43:50.720 --> 43:54.360
you want to reward them with some sort of magic item but you don't necessarily know

43:54.360 --> 44:01.120
what to do because you weren't planning on that they they managed to to go and do something

44:01.120 --> 44:05.080
that you want to reward them somehow but you have no idea so like maybe you think of oh

44:05.080 --> 44:11.720
I want to pull uncommon magic item really a lot of the the features were also revolving

44:11.720 --> 44:20.160
around Dungeons and Dragons and trying to help with my own game mastering initiative

44:20.160 --> 44:25.640
order and skills challenges were also one thing where it kept the persistent state of

44:25.640 --> 44:34.040
the current initiative challenges or initiative orders where essentially that kind of means

44:34.040 --> 44:39.840
that there's some sort of combative encounter that is happening at that moment same thing

44:39.840 --> 44:46.040
with skills challenges just being able to track that and having some order to a more

44:46.040 --> 44:54.040
complex situation so maybe it's not a combat situation but a practical example might be

44:54.040 --> 45:00.680
hey you have to escape this castle like you're not in combat yet but you are also about to

45:00.680 --> 45:08.680
be arrested like how how does your team navigate that and attaching a sort of the reason why

45:08.680 --> 45:12.200
I would attach an initiative order to that is just to give the opportunity for everybody

45:12.200 --> 45:17.440
in the team to contribute because then it goes in a sequential order of turns as opposed

45:17.440 --> 45:23.840
to whoever raises their hand first and blurts out what they want to do gives a lot more

45:23.840 --> 45:34.480
opportunity for contributions as opposed to not with those features that was really the

45:34.480 --> 45:41.080
kind of core concept behind it the intention was to kind of take input and provide output

45:41.080 --> 45:50.640
through a discord server which discords python api or discord pi like it is so useful and

45:50.640 --> 45:56.720
so easy to use that it felt like you know these features are just flying out of my fingers

45:56.720 --> 46:03.600
into the keyboard into the repository so it was really exciting seeing it and I had it

46:03.600 --> 46:13.280
on a server of about 50 people and that it was also doing like event reminders like kind

46:13.280 --> 46:16.720
of like asynchronous stuff like I just started building on top of it and kind of having it

46:16.720 --> 46:26.040
be a one one bot for everything for that server so people could go and set reminders go and

46:26.040 --> 46:34.000
specific events like maybe there was some sort of like every monday we do this like

46:34.000 --> 46:38.600
just sending reminders and stuff like that trying to think about what else off the top

46:38.600 --> 46:44.360
of my head but it was just a whole bunch of features just discord oriented for that purpose

46:44.360 --> 46:51.760
just playing around and seeing what the extent of the discord pi library could do and being

46:51.760 --> 46:59.440
able to use it positively like just to improve the experience on a server so that was a lot

46:59.440 --> 47:06.160
of fun with it I mean in terms of like open source like being able to fork it build on

47:06.160 --> 47:12.320
it I'd say anybody that wants to can go for it it's one of the big reasons why I put it

47:12.320 --> 47:19.040
on github in a public repository because it's just built on discord pi and a couple other

47:19.040 --> 47:24.400
minor libraries that I'm pretty sure all have the same kind of licensing that it's just

47:24.400 --> 47:33.360
kind of like hey go for it so yeah I mean anybody that wants to to pull or contribute

47:33.360 --> 47:39.400
build on that like a lot of the concepts are were really helpful for me to learn especially

47:39.400 --> 47:46.960
like asynchronous handling of like messages and being able to like shard and kind of basically

47:46.960 --> 47:54.400
thread a bot so that then in the event of like multiple servers trying to add this bot

47:54.400 --> 48:02.000
to it then you know like how do you handle that and and keep a data structure that makes

48:02.000 --> 48:11.440
sense for like you know server a shouldn't be seeing the data for server b and you get

48:11.440 --> 48:17.080
into that even more so with like I added like xp tracking and stuff like that as well so

48:17.080 --> 48:22.160
every time somebody sent a message like you know should that xp carry over between server

48:22.160 --> 48:27.200
to server those those were the kind of questions that I had so like I mean it was extremely

48:27.200 --> 48:34.320
beneficial to to build and it really improved my knowledge of building software so if it

48:34.320 --> 48:39.560
helps anybody like that sees it and wants to to take a look or play around with discord

48:39.560 --> 48:46.840
pi and see what's capable say go for it right so do you it's interesting I like a lot of

48:46.840 --> 48:53.360
the features and a lot of they make me think like do you foresee a machine learning aspect

48:53.360 --> 49:01.000
to this being useful say somebody is like really like dug into the open ai python stuff

49:01.000 --> 49:06.920
and they're like hmm I wonder if we can add some like machine learning aspects to this

49:06.920 --> 49:12.480
thing is that something you'd be interested in exploring I think so I think there's a

49:12.480 --> 49:20.520
lot of benefits to machine learning like from a perspective of like just trying to improve

49:20.520 --> 49:25.360
our lives instead of replace people's like jobs or anything like that there are a lot

49:25.360 --> 49:33.240
of aspects where we we can improve people's lives with it the with discord specifically

49:33.240 --> 49:42.320
I can see potentially like being able to process and understand what what violent communication

49:42.320 --> 49:50.120
looks like what like derogatory communication looks like and as the you know human like

49:50.120 --> 49:54.800
linguistics evolves like having something that evolves with it to be able to accurately

49:54.800 --> 50:03.240
create a safe and comfortable environment I can see that being very useful from the

50:03.240 --> 50:12.600
my specific bot I can see a lot of value in doing machine learning on how to properly

50:12.600 --> 50:20.100
build an encounter so like with every monster and Dungeons and Dragons there is some sort

50:20.100 --> 50:26.480
of challenge rating assigned to them and different skills that they can use even in the same

50:26.480 --> 50:35.240
challenge rating and like that challenge ratings from 0 to 30 you still have a lot of aspects

50:35.240 --> 50:40.240
where that challenge rating isn't exactly a full indicator of what how challenging this

50:40.240 --> 50:44.840
is going to be for your party because certain classes are are you know have different abilities

50:44.840 --> 50:52.280
that may be better suited to combat a creature than others so I can see from a machine learning

50:52.280 --> 51:01.080
perspective like it might be valuable to take a deeper understanding of not just the challenge

51:01.080 --> 51:05.400
ratings but also the the classes and being like hey given these are the players that

51:05.400 --> 51:11.960
are engaging with this this is a more realistic aspect of whether or not this encounter is

51:11.960 --> 51:17.880
easy medium hard or deadly you know I can see a lot of value in that as well because

51:17.880 --> 51:23.840
then that creates a better experience when the GM doesn't have to worry about completely

51:23.840 --> 51:31.840
TPKing the party which is a total party kill you know or alternatively creating a big bad

51:31.840 --> 51:36.520
and like bringing that person in only to have it be completely curb stomped by the party

51:36.520 --> 51:43.400
because you know like based off of like even action economy you could run into those types

51:43.400 --> 51:51.160
of issues where where one enemy is moving for every five people that are fighting against

51:51.160 --> 51:56.800
it like obviously there's just like that economy of action like is going to create a problem

51:56.800 --> 52:04.720
so machine learning to better understand that and apply those more higher level concepts

52:04.720 --> 52:09.680
to Dungeons and Dragons and properly schedule an encounter and like create an encounter

52:09.680 --> 52:14.600
that's valuable and meaningful and kind of accomplishes what the DM is trying to do.

52:14.600 --> 52:20.000
I think that could be super valuable and it would be super cool if I had a tool like that.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Yeah, that's great.

52:22.000 --> 52:29.960
Yeah, I'm fascinated about how we can use these new found technologies and skills to

52:29.960 --> 52:36.480
improve our lives definitely I think that is the one thing that I kind of decided to

52:36.480 --> 52:42.480
do is to look at it from a positive perspective there's a lot of negativity around it and

52:42.480 --> 52:47.560
I understand it but at the same time I'm like it's not going anywhere so we might as well

52:47.560 --> 52:55.040
find ways of using it effectively to improve us as a species maybe that's maybe a little

52:55.040 --> 53:01.360
bit going too far but maybe not maybe it's possible but at least like improving my day

53:01.360 --> 53:05.880
to day like is it any way it can make me a little bit more productive take care of some

53:05.880 --> 53:11.600
of the medium that I don't really enjoy doing so you know can I have something that's trained

53:11.600 --> 53:16.680
to help me do these things yeah I'm trying to see it from that perspective but then keeping

53:16.680 --> 53:23.080
ethics in mind and you know is this done like what is the potential downsides of this like

53:23.080 --> 53:29.240
keeping that in your mind but not being a complete cynic about all of this right there's

53:29.240 --> 53:35.680
a positive aspect to it positive aspect really to anything it's just a matter of like you

53:35.680 --> 53:41.240
know especially with AI like we can find ways to incorporate it without necessarily making

53:41.240 --> 53:48.280
people's lives worse I agree 100% yeah yeah for sure so with everything that you've experienced

53:48.280 --> 53:55.200
in your time in tech for people just getting into the industry whether that is young folks

53:55.200 --> 54:00.240
getting into it like because just straight out of school or out of university or whether

54:00.240 --> 54:04.800
it's people in different stages of their lives deciding to switch careers like do you have

54:04.800 --> 54:09.760
any like advice for these people like what what should they think about keep in mind

54:09.760 --> 54:17.360
when they're just getting into this set some expectations that's more same than some of

54:17.360 --> 54:23.280
the some of the expectations that are sometimes thrown out there when it comes to tech breaking

54:23.280 --> 54:31.680
the problem in smaller chunks like just in general it's really easy to be intimidated

54:31.680 --> 54:37.960
by wanting to learn how to program I have a couple people who have reached out even

54:37.960 --> 54:41.720
in my current company where they're like hey I really want to learn how to program I want

54:41.720 --> 54:47.560
to get to the point of developer and I'm like okay I'd be happy to help like if you have

54:47.560 --> 54:52.240
some sort of learning and you're trying to understand how something works or even learn

54:52.240 --> 54:57.880
how some of the things work more deeply in our company like I'd be happy to do that

54:57.880 --> 55:05.040
and like it seems like a lot of times people get intimidated by the daunting task that

55:05.040 --> 55:11.200
is learning programming because it seems like such a big mountain for a lot of people and

55:11.200 --> 55:17.400
really you only get up that mountain through several smaller steps right like you know

55:17.400 --> 55:22.280
even software building you know you break those problems down we've kind of mentioned

55:22.280 --> 55:27.480
that before it's the same thing with learning software like maybe you want to be a front

55:27.480 --> 55:31.440
end developer or something like that like you know there there are smaller components

55:31.440 --> 55:37.280
to what that is like maybe you want to learn the core you break that problem from front

55:37.280 --> 55:41.520
end developer and be like well no actually that means that I need to learn HTML I need

55:41.520 --> 55:46.520
to learn CSS I need to learn JavaScript I need to learn React I need to learn some sort

55:46.520 --> 55:51.960
of stack of like maybe the lamp stack or the the myrn stack or something like that like

55:51.960 --> 55:59.680
break that problem down and be like okay well now I need to learn like mongo like node.js

55:59.680 --> 56:03.280
react okay and then break that problem down and be like cool I want to learn the core

56:03.280 --> 56:10.120
concepts I want to get a project going for node.js like here's my kind of goal with this

56:10.120 --> 56:15.880
learning to be able to accomplish this and really breaking that problem down like either

56:15.880 --> 56:23.800
if you're trying to learn on your own or in academia it's really helpful and it will

56:23.800 --> 56:29.120
only help you in kind of the crazy projects that they kind of throw at you in academia

56:29.120 --> 56:36.680
as well I had a class I went to Northern Arizona University and one of the professors ran a

56:36.680 --> 56:41.880
course for operating systems where essentially we were building our own operating system

56:41.880 --> 56:51.640
simulator in C and that was really one of the points where I started really breaking

56:51.640 --> 56:57.400
down problems in the smaller chunks in a lot of ways because I had to because he would

56:57.400 --> 57:02.920
just be like hey I want you to implement all these different scheduling algorithms like

57:02.920 --> 57:08.880
shortest job first first first in first out like and it's like oh god I have two weeks

57:08.880 --> 57:15.080
to do this and like my last project didn't do so well so it's like I've got to make

57:15.080 --> 57:20.400
those changes I've got to improve those and then I've got to go and build the new stuff

57:20.400 --> 57:28.240
so it's once I start understanding like how to break those problems down that really helped

57:28.240 --> 57:36.420
me to be able to navigate challenges in the tech industry where instead of seeing it as

57:36.420 --> 57:41.520
this big project now I'm like okay these are the kind of smaller steps and then even

57:41.520 --> 57:45.780
smaller steps and then this is what I can do right now and this is kind of the process

57:45.780 --> 57:51.040
to go from point A to point B to point C however many other letters that it takes to get to

57:51.040 --> 57:58.280
the end goal so I would say that's my big advice break the problem into smaller chunks

57:58.280 --> 58:06.120
break the learning of tech and the kind of professional development in the smaller chunks

58:06.120 --> 58:12.880
and just take it in stride really because you may not think that you're really making

58:12.880 --> 58:18.800
a lot of progress but if you look back on yourself even a month after where you were

58:18.800 --> 58:25.160
today like chances are you've learned a lot more than you think you have you've probably

58:25.160 --> 58:28.520
implemented something that you didn't think that you were able to do and you look back

58:28.520 --> 58:35.680
and you're like wow it magnifies so much more in the context of years of experience

58:35.680 --> 58:41.280
to where like really you know the only way you're going to get through that is not by

58:41.280 --> 58:47.560
thinking about it from the perspective of like hey I want to get here in 10 years let's

58:47.560 --> 58:52.440
break this problem down because then at the very least those are actionable steps that

58:52.440 --> 58:57.560
your brain can actually process and be able to navigate successfully.

58:57.560 --> 59:03.000
Yeah that's great advice and yeah I totally agree I often break it down right down to

59:03.000 --> 59:09.400
what is the first variable I need to keep maybe keep some state okay cool so now how

59:09.400 --> 59:15.600
do I set this date how do I update this date so you kind of start to really from that little

59:15.600 --> 59:23.000
tiny variable that then builds out and out and out into solving the bigger solution so

59:23.000 --> 59:29.520
in closing you've shared like many of your interests but one other one that I know that

59:29.520 --> 59:34.440
you have is you're a tattoo enthusiast you know the second person in a week that I've

59:34.440 --> 59:40.960
spoken to that has the same interest and the one thing that I always enjoy about it is

59:40.960 --> 59:46.200
learning about the stories behind the tattoos because often they're super interesting so

59:46.200 --> 59:51.120
is there any particular tattoo that you have that has a story of special meaning to you

59:51.120 --> 59:55.640
behind it that you're wanting to share with the community?

59:55.640 --> 01:00:03.520
Oh yeah totally so I kind of have my whole arm here like my right arm kind of filled

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.040
up with tattoos still need to finish it up like there's a couple of blank spaces and

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:12.840
I'd like to get my tattoo artist to actually fill it in and make it feel like a completed

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:23.960
like sleeve but there's one right here if you can see that one so for audio purposes

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:30.200
I'll go and describe it so essentially it's kind of a dragon face kind of in like black

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:37.800
and white lots of shading in it as well as some aspects of red in the eyes the dragon

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:44.400
itself is from a game called Monster Hunter Monster Hunter World to be specifically or

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:54.280
to be specific sorry the what's this is the final boss of their the expansion Iceborne

01:00:54.280 --> 01:01:01.560
in a lot of ways Monster Hunter really is like similar to the experiences I've had

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:07.200
where you are taking things one hunt at a time and like you're like wow this game is

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:13.740
really hard like I'm not sure if this is necessarily like great like sometimes it's not the easiest

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:18.600
game to play especially depending on what kind of weapon you choose to play that game

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.400
like whether it's a greatsword like a gunlance or something like that there's like 16 different

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:33.600
weapons but this was actually my first tattoo and the reason why I got it was mainly it

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:44.720
was something bold I wanted to have a piece on my body that was bold when people saw it

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.720
then they were like whoa like it's an eye-catcher immediately people are like whoa that is so

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:58.120
cool can I take a look at that it's a little bit vain but at the same time the other aspect

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.160
of it it was really my first tattoo and I was kind of on the fence for a while about

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:10.480
getting tattoos a lot of my upbringing was kind of like oh no well your body is a temple

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:17.120
you know all this sort of Christian values associated with that and ultimately getting

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:22.080
out and actually exploring the world myself and understanding the world and perceiving

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.320
it myself that really opened my eyes to like well you know yeah my body is a temple I should

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:34.040
take care of it but you know I it's my choice what I get to decorate it in my temple with

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:41.680
you know like if I'm you know just to kind of put it in that temple perspective so really

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:48.160
with that I like Monster Hunter is a game that I hold very near and dear to my heart

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:54.400
and Sharashvalda itself it's kind of like this world-ending worm like this kind of and

01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:02.440
the way it's presented in the game is this kind of like almost omniscient like dragon

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:07.720
that is just like constantly like there's a point once you start fighting in in like

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:13.200
the third phase where its eyes open up and it's those same stark kind of red eyes except

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:19.440
the eyes are not tracking your player in the game they are tracking you the camera perspective

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:25.000
so regardless of where you're hitting and stuff that that camera you know it creates

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.560
this element of like the Shara knows what's going on almost you know like knows what's

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:37.200
what what this is what this is versus you know like just being in that game it kind

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.040
of creates this kind of fourth wall break of this dragon that is so wise and intelligent

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:48.600
that it can see beyond that perspective and and generally speaking that that kind of aspect

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:54.840
of wisdom and and stuff like that is also a big component of why I chose that monster

01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:00.000
out of all the monsters because I could have chosen like the the cover art dragon or something

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.800
like that you know I could have chosen any anything but really Sharashvalda really resonated

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:15.040
with me yeah that's great I knew there was a story thank you so much this was a wonderful

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:21.920
