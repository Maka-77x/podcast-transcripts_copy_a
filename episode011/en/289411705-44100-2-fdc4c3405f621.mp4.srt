Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey Raphael, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thanks Kouk, thanks for having me.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a huge pleasure. I'm glad we're finally able to meet and to talk.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,600
I think you were maybe, after Riku, you were like the first person to join the Mycelium

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,600
Network and you've done so much to promote it. I am really grateful for everything you've done.

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,280
I know a lot about your story, but the people listening to the podcast might not. So I think

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,600
the best place to start is for you to tell us more about who you are. And as I've said with

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,800
previous guests, feel free to go as far back in history as you want and up to the present day.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:03,440
All right. I'm Raphael. I'm Brazilian and actually I'm not from the IT world. I've been

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,760
working with criminal law for like eight years. I work for a judge and I work with you in criminal

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:22,800
cases. And this year I started to migrate to change career paths. And I was actually curious

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,200
because one of the things I started doing when I started studying programming and everything

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:39,840
was working with translation. So I started working with the MDN localization and then

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,080
I popped up in one of the, I think it was, it was the first community call you promoted.

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,680
And then one thing led to another and I ended up in the Mycelium Network. And about me, I actually

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:05,840
have had a brief contact with programming. Like 15 years ago, I started doing mechanical engineering

19
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:16,080
and I went as far as the third year, but then I gave up and started studying law. And by that time,

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:25,920
it was very different from the feeling that I have now. I started studying in the university

21
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:40,080
and we started with, I think it was Pascal. And I think it was Turgopascal. And actually we did all

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:50,240
the exercises on paper, not on computer. It was very strange. And it was a fun discipline to take

23
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,160
a fun course because it was very challenging. We were studying basically math problems,

24
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,000
but it was not very welcoming. So it didn't get my attention at the time.

25
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:12,320
And my two brothers, they are in the IT field. My middle brother is on

26
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Netherlands. He's a backend developer. And my younger brother is on the university. And I have

27
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:32,080
always had this like proximity with tech. I always liked to discuss with him about some issues,

28
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:40,880
about the technology in general, but I never really dug into programming since that period.

29
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:50,000
And in my job, my actual job, it's curious because I'm known as the IT guy because it shakes

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,160
everything for the people that don't know anything about it. But mostly it's like very common issues

31
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,600
and very basic issues that people have kind of, people are always afraid of computers. I don't

32
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:14,000
know how to explain it. So mostly what I always do is like reason with someone like, why do,

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,840
what do you want to do? And why do you think it's not working? And it's basically leading them to

34
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:31,440
find the solution themselves. So the other thing that led me to change career paths is because I'm

35
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,000
planning on moving to Canada next year, the beginning of next year. And then it's a long-term

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,960
plan, like to migrate completely to the tech field and maybe someday become like a digital nomad.

37
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,280
It's like a dream I have with my wife. So it's like a plan for like five, 10 years. But in the

38
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,920
short future, I probably will be working with law in Canada. I will be working in a lawyer's office.

39
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:14,880
But it's since I started studying programming, the community and I've been part of the

40
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,920
Missile Union Network, but I've been part of a lot of different communities. I've been exploring

41
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:27,280
a lot of different communities. I've been exploring a lot. And this is something I never

42
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:37,360
had imagined back then when I started computing and then gave up. Because it's really a different,

43
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:47,200
it gave me a real different impression of the field. So I talked to a lot of people,

44
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:54,240
I connected to a lot of people. And I found in like two or three months a lot of friends.

45
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,400
I don't know anyone personally, but I have a lot of exchange of thoughts, of ideas. And it's very,

46
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:12,880
it drives me further. So basically that's it. And as you always say, I'm an early stage

47
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:22,160
developer. And I like this provocation of yours because we have some stigma with the word beginner.

48
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:32,640
And I have another mentor that always tells a little joke. We are always beginners here.

49
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:42,400
Some are beginners from a longer time. Some are beginners from short time. So it's like

50
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,600
putting things into perspective and we are always beginning on something.

51
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,560
Yeah. No, that's very true. I mean, that's why I think that because, like I've said,

52
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,800
backend developers going into frontend, that's new to them. And even for frontend developers

53
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,200
exploring, there's so many frameworks and things coming out these days. It's kind of calmed down

54
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,800
a little bit, but there's still a lot of action happening. I think in CSS, it's starting to

55
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,040
happen more than in JavaScript. And so whenever you approach one of these new frameworks,

56
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,640
you're new to it. It's like, yeah, sure. You know the underlying language or the underlying

57
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,720
technology, but the way you have to think about how you build applications is different. React

58
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,280
famously always says that React is just JavaScript. And to some extent, that's true. But it's not

59
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,800
100% true because while the underlying language is just JavaScript, there's a specific way of

60
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,520
thinking when you write in React that is not necessarily how you would approach something if

61
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,400
you were writing without React. So those aspects of React, you can be a really good JavaScript

62
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,040
programmer, but still find it challenging because now you have to adopt this different approach.

63
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,240
I know for myself, for the longest time, it felt so weird to put it on click on an element because

64
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,560
I've always learned that you separate concerns, and that's not how you do it. You do a document

65
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,600
or query selector to get the element, and then you do element.addEventListener. You don't go on

66
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,960
the HTML element and put an on click there. It's not the way to do it. But the reason you do that

67
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,720
in React is it's idiomatic, and it's actually stripped away back into it, addEventListeners,

68
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,680
into addEventListeners by Babel or whichever transpiler you're using. So at the end of the day,

69
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,360
it does end up being an addEventListener. It's just the way you write it is different.

70
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,320
State management, it's something that's very unique. It's now unique to a lot of frameworks,

71
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:50,480
but React introduced this whole idea of UI being a representation of application state. Again,

72
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,040
that's a new way of thinking of stuff. And I sometimes find it hard again when I move back

73
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,000
and I just write something in plain JavaScript, then I miss this used state thing. It's like,

74
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,160
oh, how do I do this now without having that used state hook? You're constantly going between these

75
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,640
worlds, and as you move between these technologies and frameworks and things, you're constantly an

76
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,280
early stage person at something. So I think we need to even be okay with using the word beginner,

77
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,880
but for now, let's use a different nomenclature just so that we can break down the stigmas there.

78
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,240
It's very interesting that you've gone mechanical engineering, then you went into

79
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,680
law, and then you decided to go back into more of an engineering kind of thing.

80
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:48,400
Is it just that you've felt the previous industries or segments or whatever we want to call it,

81
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,040
did you just find that the connection that you thought was there didn't last,

82
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,160
and you kind of feel disconnected from this world?

83
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:09,840
Exactly. And I have a deep fear that I learned to deal with, that is that I would

84
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:20,080
end up jumping from thing to thing all my life. And actually, there are more areas that I explored

85
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:27,360
before going to mechanical engineering, but that was in my early adult life, the first one that was

86
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:36,640
like a profession. And it's actually a good question you asked because that has a lot to do

87
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,840
with my view for technology now. Because when I started in mechanical engineering,

88
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:52,080
one thing I always liked was to solve problems. And back in the day, it was most like physics

89
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:02,240
or maths problems. And this was the most topics I used to study, so I chose mechanical engineering

90
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:11,920
for it because I would see a lot of them more in the university. And I really liked the calculus

91
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,240
courses, but nowadays I don't know why I like it so much because it's like Greek to me. But

92
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:33,600
in that period, I kind of felt that most of my colleagues just thought about the technical

93
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,880
aspect of things. They don't discuss it, ethical problems, they don't discuss it,

94
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:52,400
the impacts of the solutions they were thinking in the world. In that, I was feeling out of the...

95
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,240
I didn't have identification with people. I liked to study the courses, but I didn't have

96
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:12,400
the identification with the profession. So I kind of had a course on ethics and legislation

97
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:22,160
on mechanical engineering, and then I decided to move to law. And I began law with another passion

98
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:31,280
because I liked the philosophy of law, I liked discussing ethical issues. I took part in a lot

99
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:41,680
of groups in the university. It was a very great moment for me because it was very effervescent.

100
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:54,640
But when I entered the profession to see after I graduated, I started to realize I have a lot of

101
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:04,400
idealizations of the field. And it's nothing like what we would expect. I actually have been very

102
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:14,160
lucky to have worked in a position where I could deliver justice and I could make an impact on

103
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:26,480
someone's life, like someone that is innocent and I reverted that decision. And that kept me going,

104
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:37,360
but I always felt I missed it more because it was like swimming against the current. And one thing

105
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:45,600
I realized since I started studying tech is that there is a lot of people thinking about these

106
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,120
ethical issues. And that was one major thing that made me stick around my student network. It was

107
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:03,520
your vision. There is not just learning to code. It's like your purpose or your role in the society,

108
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:11,360
in the world and everything. And this week I was talking to a friend that is learning

109
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:21,520
web development in the same course I'm taking. And she lives in Europe and she is migrating

110
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:32,640
fields too, but she came from a 20-year career as an actress. So it's very different worlds.

111
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:40,240
And one thing that caught my eye is because I asked her, have you decided

112
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:49,600
what you do want in the future in the long run? And I really, I confess, I really expected her

113
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:58,240
to say, oh, I want to stick with web development. I want to learn Ruby or I don't know. Or I want

114
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,480
to be on the front end, on the back end. And she answered me. And that was very curious. She

115
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:13,920
answered me, I want to work with something like global warming or environment. And that was a

116
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:24,320
really interesting thing because she, I have this kind of thoughts, but I'm so used to not discussing

117
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:32,160
this with people. But she was thinking way ahead. She wants, and I wanted to have purpose with what

118
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm doing. It's not like just, oh, I want to have a good pay rate. I want to earn in dollar and

119
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:47,680
everything. And that's sad because it's what I always see people talking about, but they don't

120
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,960
like discuss where do I want to work, where this company might be doing, where the impact I expect

121
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:03,360
to be part of. So I guess we kind of need this kind of talks a lot more. And although I have

122
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,360
been seeing a lot of conference that approach something that touches these issues,

123
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:20,400
like we had, like the code length was very, very cool. And I was just today on the OctoGato

124
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:27,120
conference by GitHub, and they are talking about this too. But I really have this, the feeling that

125
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:37,520
we are a minority yet. So we really need to empower these voices. And it's very, it's kind of

126
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:46,320
problematic for us, like white guys, males, and everything. But I guess our role is to like

127
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:58,560
support these people. And I'm like, planning to go to our first world country and everything. But

128
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,560
it's crazy. I am a white male guy, but when I arrived there, they see me as Latin American.

129
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,920
And that's not a concept we have here in Brazil. And so it's kind of interesting to

130
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,520
like think of, think globally, all the issues, like your identity, your citizenship.

131
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:32,800
And I really like doing this. So I really hope that I'm really enjoying learning to code.

132
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,440
But I really hope that I end up in the long run, not just like sitting from the computer and calling

133
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,600
anything they taught me. They said to me, I really hope that I have like a purpose of what I'm doing.

134
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:57,600
It's that what I was searching in the law field. And that is what I'm searching in the tech field too.

135
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,400
Yeah, that makes sense. I can totally see that connection. I think,

136
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,480
what is it that I was thinking? Journalism. I think a lot of people go into journalism for

137
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:18,560
the same reasons. They believe that through journalistic means, they can have an impact

138
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,760
on the world. And then I think a lot of them also get demotivated when they get into,

139
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,160
they work for the wrong place. And they find out that it's actually just regurgitating things that

140
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,280
has been served to them. It's not making a difference. That's why I think publications

141
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,040
like ProPublica, those people are so, so important. Because they are truly focused on

142
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:49,280
bringing the truth to us. I mean, it's for us to decide what to do with that, right? But I don't

143
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,160
think we should, I don't like the idea of being constantly having to second guess everything I

144
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,920
hear. It's something that frustrates me a lot. It's like, rather just be open and tell the truth.

145
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,400
And then I can make up my mind what I want to do with that. Do I accept it? Do I want to push

146
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,800
back against it? Or what do I want to do? But don't feed me lies because then later on, what do you do?

147
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,480
You get so, I don't know, demoralized that you kind of just ignore everything and you get this

148
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:23,200
pessimistic view about the world. I was thinking about it yesterday, like, there's a lot of

149
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,360
negativity around the internet going on at the moment. And I think it's not unfounded.

150
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,200
I think it's important that these things are being talked about. But I think there's a lot

151
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,480
more on the internet that is good than these negative things. And I think, again, the negative

152
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:50,240
thing is being made, it's being brought to the fore a lot more than it should be. I don't want

153
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,160
us to live with blinders on and pretend that everything is great, but it's important to touch

154
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,960
on these issues. And I mean, one of the reasons I have these conversations with people, and I am

155
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,680
open to speaking with anybody from anywhere. And especially, I kind of actually specifically focus

156
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,680
on elevating people's voices that normally don't get heard, is because these are the stories we

157
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,960
need to hear. Because this is the truth. These are people that, they're not sharing an opinion,

158
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,720
they're sharing a lived experience. And I think there's that famous quote that says, if you

159
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,440
talk from experience, nobody can disregard it, because your experience is your experience. And

160
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,160
nobody can say it's wrong. Like, no, it's my experience, it can't be wrong. Because I've

161
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,680
already, with the few recordings that I've done, I've already had that exact thing happen where I

162
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:49,280
spoke to a woman early in tech, but in the United States. And her experience is vastly different

163
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,400
from Pamela that I spoke to recently, who's from Mexico. She now lives in the US, but she's still

164
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,440
facing challenges in the US with visa and stuff like that. So her experience getting into tech

165
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,600
was completely different to the other person. And I think it's important to hear these

166
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,880
differences and find, and I think that's the other idea behind mycelium, is to connect these worlds

167
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,040
to each other, so that we understand that our lived experience is not necessarily another person's

168
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,720
lived experience. And so that we can be more compassionate toward each other, and sometimes

169
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:32,640
not be so quick to want to, I don't know, defend our opinion, or what we think is right, that we're

170
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,240
more open to listening, and just being compassionate and being there for somebody when they struggle.

171
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,160
I think the thing that Riku, for example, has brought up is he's always scared to make a comment

172
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:51,200
on the mycelium, because he's scared it's a stupid question, and then he looks, and those are the

173
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,280
walls that we need to break down. There's nothing like that. The fact that you asked, I mean,

174
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:04,240
Peter, that I spoke to in one of these, in one of the previous podcasts, he said that it's actually

175
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,840
a good thing when you ask these questions that some people might think is a stupid question,

176
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,520
because more often than not, there's other people in the room that are afraid to ask that question

177
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:21,920
by you showing a weakness, or you, like he says, taking a punch in the face. You're giving the

178
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,400
other people the answer that they actually wanted to hear. So sometimes you have to just stand up

179
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,720
and ask the question and not care. If it's a stupid question, so be it. There might be 10 other

180
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,560
people in the room that also didn't know, and now all of them know, and I took a little bit of a

181
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,760
punch to my ego, but I'll get over it. So I think that's very important. But I'm quite interested

182
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,640
in this nomad life that you have talked about, because that is kind of something that I'm also,

183
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:55,680
it's also a dream, it's something I'm working towards as well. So I think I've asked this

184
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,360
question in many different ways. In the beginning, I asked people, would you rather start your own

185
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,960
business or work for a company? But then I kind of rephrased it and rephrased it. And what it's

186
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,440
boiled down to me in the end is, what does success look like for you? And I think you have a unique

187
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,280
perspective with the nomadic life that you see. So in this tech world, in this new world that

188
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,920
you're exploring, the new country you're moving to, what does success look like for you?

189
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:38,720
Well, deep question. But I guess I'm not very ambitious in the normal, the common sense.

190
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:48,000
I don't, me and my wife, we are very alike. We never been like chasing

191
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:58,000
in our big purchases or consuming a lot of things. And what we always were eager to is to

192
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:08,240
get in contact with different cultures and having real life experiences that

193
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:20,720
makes us want to, oh, it makes us expand our horizons. So we like to travel a lot. We haven't

194
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:30,480
done that too much in the past years, not at all. But we like to travel so much, not because

195
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:41,120
because we don't travel to buy things or to, we don't like the tourist spots. We like to go off

196
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:48,640
the beaten track. We like to see how people live. We like to connect with people like randomly.

197
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:59,040
Like the first time I was in Canada, it was like 10 years ago. And I was in Toronto for 20 days.

198
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:07,120
And one of the best days on my trip was this particular day when I was exploring the

199
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:18,000
Herborfront, like the lakeshore. And I saw this guy that lived on the streets. He had like a

200
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:30,000
a market car with a lot of stuff. And he looks just like Santa. He was a very big, big white bird.

201
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,160
And we started talking and he started like telling how he got there and why he wants to live in the

202
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:48,480
street because it was an option. He offered me food. We ate together. He had like a lot of snacks.

203
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:59,200
And we, it was autumn. So for me, it was very cold, but it was warm for them. And as the day goes

204
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,840
long, I started to feel very chilly. And then I realized we've been talking like five, six hours.

205
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,400
And it was like this incredible experience to really just pass time with someone and really

206
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,640
connect in a deep level. So that's something I always wanted to do, I always like to do.

207
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:31,680
And this Digital Nomad dream that I have is not to be running around all year long in a lot of

208
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:38,880
places in a hurry. It's just like living in the city for some time, see how people live, see,

209
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,040
know some different people and then like move on and live somewhere, see for a couple of months

210
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:55,200
or six months or a year. Just don't be tamed to a particular place. Just be more without roots.

211
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:04,560
Just be more of the world. So we really envision this like very far on our lives,

212
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:13,760
maybe earlier than we think. But I know it's really hard to create some stability to have this

213
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:24,480
and to not be depending on a regular paycheck and everything. So we are slowly building towards this.

214
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:38,560
I don't know if I ever like be an entrepreneur, but I guess it's something that maybe happens

215
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:45,760
someday. But either way, what I like, what I want to work with, it's just something that has

216
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:53,520
a kind of purpose, that helps people. It can be like the slightest way, it can be just

217
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:02,080
a little help for someone, but I really need this human side of things. That's why I came to miss

218
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,080
a lot of my works. Back in the first years, I used to talk to a lot of people, like people that have

219
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:18,560
processes in the justice, and I was hearing the pledge and everything. But as I grew in the career,

220
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:27,440
I've been more and more disconnected from the face-to-face and more in the work. So that's

221
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,000
something I really miss, is to talk to people, to hear the problems, to kind of offer a solution.

222
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:43,520
This is, my wife says, a good thing about me and a bad thing, because anyone that came to me

223
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:51,120
with a problem, I can't stop thinking about it. It's my first reaction to think of a solution,

224
00:28:51,120 --> 00:29:00,960
and this can be really annoying sometimes, but it's just my nature. A lot of times I start wasting

225
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,280
my time with other people's problems just because I'm curious. I can't stand having a problem and

226
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:17,760
not having a clue what to do with it, so it's really something that I learn to live with,

227
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:26,480
but sometimes it makes me waste a lot of time. That's what we see in the Lambron,

228
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:33,760
right? Not being in one place for our lives. We want to have the flexibility.

229
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:43,040
It can happen that we live for 10 years in one particular spot, but I like to have the option.

230
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:51,920
I like to have the freedom to, if I want it, restart in some place new. So this is what I'm

231
00:29:51,920 --> 00:30:03,680
wanting to experiment in Canada, restarting my life, and this is what I'm wanting to be

232
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:12,960
used to, having this ability to restart every time I feel the need to. I don't like to be

233
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:25,120
in one place or in one job. I don't like this feeling, so I want to be more lightweight. I want

234
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:34,720
to travel light, so that's more about it. That sounds like a great plan. I agree. For me also,

235
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,000
I've had the conversation with people before. I don't mind it when people say

236
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,560
they necessarily… when there's laws or when there's regulations and certain ways to do things.

237
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,440
I think that's important. That's why the miscellaneous network as a code of conduct,

238
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,720
I think these things are important. But what I don't like is when people take options away from

239
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:08,720
me. That is something I don't like. Don't try and pigeonhole me. Don't try and put me in a box

240
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,120
and expect me to be happy, because the box that you put me in is not necessarily the one that I

241
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,640
feel comfortable in. And not having the option to try a different box, that's what I don't like.

242
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,000
I might conform to certain rules and practices and stuff like that, but it should be on my terms

243
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,640
and stuff that has meaning and value to me, not something that somebody else has decided for me.

244
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:44,960
And I think there's quite a lot of quotes and things that relates to that. If you don't create

245
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,800
your own life, somebody else will create it for you. So we need to be careful that we don't bow

246
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:57,600
down to other people's hopes and dreams for us. We have to have our own and not be scared to have

247
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:07,520
our own. I think it's human. All of us want freedom. I can't imagine there's one person in

248
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,480
the world that says, no, I don't care for freedom. I think we all want freedom. And when our freedom

249
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,840
is impeached, I think that is when people get angry. And understandably so. Some people

250
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,280
don't handle their anger very well, and they use it in a destructive way.

251
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:31,920
I'd prefer to guide us towards using our anger in constructive ways, in ways that we can lift

252
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:38,240
each other up, not destroy things. I always see these things where people are unhappy with

253
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,160
something with their education they're getting from their schools. And yes, you should be angry

254
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:50,640
about that. You should say, I don't like this. I feel I have a right to a better education.

255
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:58,800
But then burning down the school doesn't help. That is not the way you should channel that anger.

256
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,800
You should channel it in a different way. Find a constructive way that you're building up,

257
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,680
not breaking down. Because otherwise we're constantly going back to square one,

258
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,040
and we have to start over. And so we're never progressing as a society, as humanity. We're

259
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,560
always just recreating the wheel over and over again. And yeah, that's no good.

260
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:27,920
And talking about the individual side of it,

261
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:38,480
one interesting thing that I think I like, and I see this, I guess, in your lifestyle,

262
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:47,920
is that you do a lot of different things. I recently discovered just today that you play

263
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:58,480
classical guitar. And so it's something that I used to do a lot growing up. I was a biker,

264
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:09,440
I was a psycho activist, I liked to photograph. I was in a group of photographers, and I did a

265
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:17,680
lot of stuff. And then we are growing up, and then we are working so much, and we are being demanded

266
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:28,480
so much that life starts to resume to work. So that's another kind of freedom that I want

267
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:39,040
to have, to have free time. I heard this a lot when we talk about Canada, is the work-life balance.

268
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:47,520
They talk about this a lot. And it's not like a concept we have in Brazil. It's almost

269
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:55,920
the other way around. We like praise overworking, praise the workaholic. So it's very toxic, and

270
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:06,400
it's kind of what led me to just focus on work for quite a long time. And then I started to

271
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:14,720
feel the need to have more of life. And that's something I really want to do, and that's something

272
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:26,480
I've really been feeling welcome to do. The other day you talked about the social network called

273
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,880
Bollywood. And I really liked the idea, because there's a lot of things I like to do, and there's

274
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:41,520
a lot of things I do well. So I don't want to go from the lawyer box to the developer box. I don't

275
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,720
want to have boxes. I want to have a lot of different activities I have interesting. So

276
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:59,040
I really cherish that we are having this kind of space where you have value because you are

277
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,400
complex. You like different things. You like to talk about a lot of things. You don't

278
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:14,720
have the right topic to talk about, or this is so much of a topic. You can talk about this here.

279
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,040
You always have some space. You just have to organize it so everyone that wants to talk about

280
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:29,440
it finds each other and everything. And I really, when I listened to the podcast with Rico, I

281
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,840
had a lot of identification with this issue to put yourself in public and to speak in public.

282
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:44,240
And I grew up as a very shy person, and I just started to speak. I spoke in public the first time

283
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:54,560
when I was 24 years. And for five years, I always felt really bad. Every time I wanted to speak in

284
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:02,160
public, I almost passed away. So it was very difficult. But with time, you start to get used

285
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:12,480
to it. And nowadays, I just speak my mind. I don't, I try at my best not to refrain from saying

286
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:22,880
something. I want to speak my mind if I'm speaking something that's garbage. Someone says garbage

287
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:30,880
very politely, I hope. And we are going to continue to keep the discussion going. So I might be wrong

288
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,760
about something, and the conversation flows. I don't have this fear of being wrong. You don't

289
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:46,320
have to have this concern. You are in this position, and a week from now, you can be

290
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,680
thinking entirely different about something. That's the beauty of connecting and discussing

291
00:37:51,680 --> 00:38:01,680
and everything. And that is true for life, that's true for these ethical issues we're facing,

292
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:10,000
that's true for our coding problems too. Because a lot of times, somebody asks a question, and

293
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:20,000
our guys have just the perfect solution. But it's not a done job. Someone can be

294
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,480
like, come up with a better solution, a more performative solution. So things are always

295
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:34,000
reinventing themselves, and we can't expect to have the right answers for everything. We have

296
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,640
the answer to that service now, and we have to keep talking about it because things are

297
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:51,920
in constant change. And on the topic of polywork, I really like it. I heard about polywork really

298
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,280
early on, and I joined it because it was like, I don't know, I think it's maybe a tech thing,

299
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,960
like you always want to try the new thing. It's like, let me see what this is. So I signed up

300
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,040
early on, and I was on there, but I wasn't really using it for much. I kind of forgot about it for

301
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:17,680
a while. And then when I was thinking about this podcast, I was like, wait a minute, I wonder if

302
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:24,480
polywork can help me find some folks. And I kind of tried it out, and the response was incredible.

303
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,960
There's so many people still that I have on a list to go back to who's interested in doing this.

304
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:38,880
It's mind-blowing. But then the founder of polywork recorded a little short video that he put on

305
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,160
the Polywork YouTube channel, and he actually defined what the idea behind polywork is.

306
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:53,040
And then it clicked for me. It was like, oh, this is exactly the place I want to be. It's about

307
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:02,240
this idea of you aren't defined by your job. You are multifaceted. You like and do many things,

308
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,480
and you change your mind from time to time, or constantly change your mind.

309
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,000
And that connected me to another thing that I heard. I heard a TED talk from a woman that talked

310
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,480
about being a multi-potentialite, because they always talk about this thing. You have so much

311
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,640
potential, and you have to focus in this specific area. And she was like, but she can't do that.

312
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,880
She has so many interests that she can't just focus on one thing. And like introverts,

313
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,480
being an introvert is a superpower. There's people that talk about that as well.

314
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,760
The same thing. And she said, actually, what she calls it is being a multi-potentialite.

315
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,160
I'll link up the TED talk in the show notes. It's a really, really great talk.

316
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,360
And I think there's a lot of us that's like that. We're introverted like me. I'm a super shy person,

317
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:58,160
but I somehow keep putting myself in these very public situations, like to pick up a guitar,

318
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,400
and to go and play in front of people. I mean, I was in a band where I played in front of people.

319
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,320
I played solo guitar in front of people. And it was nerve-racking. I mean, I've spoken at

320
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,880
conferences. I was in Venezuela once, where I spoke at a Ruby conference about Firefox

321
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,640
OAS back in the day. I kept putting myself in these situations. The interesting thing is,

322
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:26,240
even though it might seem like the weirdest thing for me to do, I kind of feel that in the moment,

323
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:36,320
I really, really feel good. It's energizing. And it gives me this boost of confidence that I just

324
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:43,280
want to do more. And so I think we need to be careful to not avoid things that makes us feel

325
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,160
uncomfortable. I think sometimes, just push yourself a little bit out of your comfort zone,

326
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:56,160
and you'll find that you actually enjoy being uncomfortable. And I think that's

327
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,520
important. And a very, very common thing for us to do, and I know I'm very guilty of it,

328
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:08,240
is to confuse excitement with anxiety. Because I feel very similar in the body. The emotions and

329
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,000
things you go through are very, very similar. And me being somebody that is an anxious person,

330
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,480
and I do have generalized anxiety disorder, I definitely confuse the two a lot of times.

331
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,120
So often, putting myself in an uncomfortable situation forces me to feel those emotions.

332
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:35,280
And then over years and years and years, you kind of learn to identify, no, this is not anxiety,

333
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,040
this is excitement. You should really feel these feelings and internalize them, because it's good.

334
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,960
This is where you get your energy from. So yeah, I think we shouldn't...

335
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,120
It makes you feel alive.

336
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:54,240
Exactly, exactly. Yeah. So I think we should... And totally, there's times when you need to

337
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,320
step back and say, that's enough for now, because it is tiring. It is tiring. If you're an introvert,

338
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:06,080
and you are shy, and you find it... To put yourself out there, it's stressful, and stress makes you

339
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,200
tired. So sometimes you need to step back and be in a comforted place. You need a place where you

340
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,440
feel at home, where you feel safe. I think the way you speak about your wife, I'm sure she is your

341
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,960
safe place. So I think whenever you feel overwhelmed, she's the person you can go to who

342
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,120
can listen and understand and be compassionate. I also, with my wife, with my kids, it's somewhere

343
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:35,040
where I can go where I know I'm not going to be judged, or where I can show my weakness without

344
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,520
being scared. And I think we should... These communities should open these opportunities

345
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,800
for us as well, to feel a bit more, be a bit more vulnerable, and not be too concerned about it.

346
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:56,080
So jumping back to more like the tech world, being from Brazil, and how do you find the tech

347
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,760
industry in Brazil? Is there things there that you find that really it needs a lot of work?

348
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:09,120
Or is it actually not what most people will think? Is it actually a very thriving, healthy industry?

349
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:21,680
Not a healthy industry. But it's hard to say because I kind of don't know too much about the

350
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:33,680
global tech industry. But what I'm more familiar with is the... That's because I'm like studying

351
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,320
a lot and learning, and then I'm exploring a lot of communities, and I'm talking to a lot of people

352
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:48,160
that are in the same position. And I'm more familiar with this. It's like, how do you start

353
00:44:48,160 --> 00:45:00,400
in the industry? I had some great talks with senior developers, but mostly people that are

354
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:08,240
in the region areas, or that are just starting, like young adults starting in tech. And one thing

355
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:15,920
that really gets me is that I don't know if it is just in Brazil, or it's like a global thing,

356
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:24,480
but people don't value the university here. And it's very crazy because in other fields it's not

357
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:33,920
a phenomenon like that. But in tech you have like this massive advertisement of boot camps

358
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:44,080
and online courses that promises that you will be earning a great paycheck in like six months,

359
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:51,680
or eight months. And it's a very unreal expectation. And a lot of people don't have

360
00:45:51,680 --> 00:46:02,400
like the sense to separate information from merchandising. So I've met with a lot of people

361
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:11,760
that got into debt to start a boot camp, or like left his job and don't have a plan, like for

362
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:20,560
two, three, four or five years. They have a plan for six months, and it's very unreal that he will

363
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:32,800
be like earning something better than his previous bro. So I have a, I could say, like a successful

364
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:44,640
career in law. I earn a good money for what I do. I have like colleagues that have two kids,

365
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:53,440
and it's been doing what I do for 20 years, and that's okay for them. But for me it has to be

366
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:02,320
something more. So I kind of came up with this plan. It's a medium to, it's a plan for the long

367
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,160
run. It's not like how I want to change everything in six months, I will be earning more than I earn

368
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:15,760
today. But I met a lot of people that really thinks this. And sometimes if you don't have

369
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:25,280
the time or the chance to do a university, like it's not possible for me and my plans to like

370
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:32,160
take four or five years and do a regular bachelor degree in computer science. I really wish that

371
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:40,880
I had this option, or I really wish that I did that years ago, but now it's not a possibility.

372
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:51,440
But what gets me, it's like people with 18, 19 years old that can do a university have parents

373
00:47:51,440 --> 00:48:00,400
that will support them through university, and they still want to do a boot camp of six months

374
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:08,080
to get into tech, and they expect that they will earn like high salaries and they will be

375
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:19,520
recruited with two overseas companies, and that's not real. So that saddens me a lot because

376
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:28,640
this kind of thinking, it's very like I want to earn money immediately. I don't care about

377
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:37,040
who I will work for. I don't care about anything. I just want this now. And it's very hard to like

378
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:44,240
convince people that you should take your time. You should build like a really strong foundation.

379
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:54,960
It may be get a first opportunity in tech, but it can't leave you far. It can't, you won't go far

380
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:04,080
with just this like basic classes and everything. So it takes, people don't realize it takes some

381
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:12,560
time to build a career. It takes some time to invest in projects. I really like your approach

382
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:22,720
with projects. I have talked to you about it, that you always plan for escalating. You start a little

383
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:31,360
project and you post the issues and you like do everything. I would expect to find in a really big

384
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:39,440
project that has like 40 people working on. And that's really a long time thinking, a long run

385
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:46,720
thinking, because you have to have this approach since the beginning. And a lot of people,

386
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:54,080
especially here in Brazil, think that they can build a portfolio like just doing code challenges

387
00:49:54,080 --> 00:50:07,040
and replicating interfaces and cloning websites. And that is good. That can lend you a first

388
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:14,000
opportunity. But you are putting not so much on the table. You are making it in you or you are

389
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:26,320
doing a new approach of something. So when I don't have like any project I'm proud about right now,

390
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:34,640
but I have a lot of ideas and I have a lot of planning going. And I know like sometime in the

391
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:44,320
future I will have something good going on. And maybe that can be like something that will help

392
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:51,920
another one or another developer would pick that and go further. So I really like this idea. And

393
00:50:51,920 --> 00:51:00,800
that's another thing that really got me into tech really hard is open sourcing. And I really like

394
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:12,720
to be part of something bigger than me. And so I kind of don't, I can't get my mind to waste time

395
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:21,440
doing just little projects and repetitive tasks. But I have a lot of ideas going on that I want to

396
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:31,520
put on the paper and then on the code. So I guess this is something that I have, I think it has to

397
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:47,040
be, it has to change. Like I can see these people with this mentality going to meet an impact. It's

398
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:56,000
not like I'm not rooting for them. But I want them to understand that it's not supposed to be

399
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:05,520
this easy. So it's like, it's really obvious that it's a lie that anyone can get a job with six

400
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:18,240
figures in six months. I think it's really interesting to state that coding is for anyone

401
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:25,280
that want it. Anyone can learn how to code. That is not the same thing to say anyone can learn how

402
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:34,240
to code in three months and have like a bigger salary. It's different things. So it's possible

403
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:43,520
for everyone, but it's a long road to follow. It's hard. It's not supposed to be easy.

404
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:52,480
In Brazil, we have this phenomenon where the global market in IT is very

405
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:01,440
hit up. So a lot of developers from Brazil are getting recruited overseas. That's what

406
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,200
happened to my brother. So a lot of companies here in Brazil are recruiting other developers

407
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:16,720
from Latin America. So it's like the talents are going to the first world countries and we are

408
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:24,960
outsourcing other least developed countries. So people have this feeling that anyone can join

409
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:36,400
to tech right now and his life will change drastically. But I can't see that way. For me,

410
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,440
it feels like it's a very long road. You have to build up step by step, day by day. You have to

411
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:53,440
have discipline. You have to have focus. You have to have consistency. So what I see happening

412
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:04,000
a lot is people starting these courses or starting university and then getting frustrated.

413
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:10,240
Frustrated and then they gave up everything because their expectations were too high.

414
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,600
But if they just stick with it for a little bit and they have just planned a little bit well,

415
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:26,720
they could find their way to tech. But the information, it's not like sexy to say,

416
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:34,240
oh, it's hard. You won't find jobs so easily. You have to build a lot of skills and everything. So

417
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:41,280
people fall for the advertising. And this is a very big issue here in Brazil. And we have a lot

418
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:49,280
of discussion about this because a lot of people are going to tech for accountants, actresses,

419
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:56,560
lawyers. Everyone is going to tech and everyone is getting frustrated. So we have to put our feet

420
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:03,680
on the ground and we have to like, is this a thing I really want to do or is this just a way to

421
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:11,680
earn more money? Because it's not a problem if you want to earn more money. But you have a lot of

422
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:18,400
options to do this. It's not just tech. So you can find something more suitable for your expectations

423
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:28,160
or for your time schedule. But people want like an easy solution for everything. And this is very

424
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:36,880
Brazilian culture. So it's very hard to reason with people. So I have a lot of talks with another

425
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:45,680
fellow, early stage developers. And I'm always the guy that's very boring and annoying that says,

426
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:52,640
it's not like that. Like take a step back, take a deep breath. I plan it very well. You have to

427
00:55:52,640 --> 00:56:00,800
know how you will support yourself through this migration. And you have a lot of people changing

428
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:07,840
careers. So you have to plan this very well. A lot of them have children to support. A lot of them

429
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:18,480
have another, have mortgages, have a lot of things to put into their accountants. And like

430
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:28,400
it's not that easy. It's not guaranteed for anyone. You can be like a genius. And it's something like

431
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:38,240
there is a lot of people that don't go to university and like learn by themselves, trying and failing

432
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:48,400
and trying again. But they are the exception. You should prefer the easy solution. But it's

433
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:55,920
the easiest path. It's like have good teachers, have good mentors and like build it slowly and

434
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,000
build it strongly. But people always pick the exception and want to be the rule.

435
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,560
I start with the premise that I'm not a genius and I'm not a very lucky guy. So I have to

436
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:16,960
put my children on the ground, put one foot in front of the other and start building very slowly.

437
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:30,320
But I know I can go really far with this, if it's something I want to do. And when I was in

438
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:39,840
university, I had this teacher of philosophy that I was in the last class he taught. He was

439
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:52,080
going to retirement. So he ended the class with a very interesting poem. Maybe I don't remember

440
00:57:52,080 --> 00:58:02,000
the name of the author now. I think he is Spanish. I don't know. But I will send you after. But he

441
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:13,360
has like this really illustrations. It's like there is no paths. He paints life as you are on

442
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:22,640
a boat and you can go to anywhere in the horizon. There is no track to follow. You have to just

443
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:28,720
find where you want to go. You have to find the direction and you have to go and discover what is

444
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:40,480
it. You don't have like a trail to follow. So this idea is makes me, made me change a lot of

445
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:51,920
assumptions I had when I was growing up. And I was entering my profession. So it stuck with me.

446
00:58:51,920 --> 00:59:00,720
Like this idea that you can go anywhere else, but it's our responsibility. You are defining the path.

447
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:08,720
There is no previous path for you to follow. And sometimes people want to have a path.

448
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,840
And sometimes people want to have, want so much to have a previous path that is guaranteed success,

449
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:24,560
but it simply don't exist. If you follow the steps of another person, it's not guaranteed that you

450
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:30,080
end up with the same result. You have a lot of factors that come into place. So you have to

451
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:38,640
accept this and learn to deal with this. So it's like an approach to life. And I have this approach

452
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:49,440
to development too. I want to, I want to take my time. I want to explore different technologies,

453
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:58,640
different tools. And I want to build my own path into technology and find the things that make sense

454
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:06,400
to me and not just follow someone that says, Oh, this is what I did. And now I am this. You have to

455
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,160
and pay me something and I will, and I will teach you how to get there. I don't believe in this.

456
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:22,240
And I, I don't, I'm not afraid like to spending money to, because I sense that we have to value

457
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:32,080
the other people's time. But I always take this as just another resource. What I was going to do

458
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:39,840
with it. It's my responsibility. It's not like a given thing. Yeah, no, I agree. And I don't think

459
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:48,080
it's just in Brazil. I've heard the same thing about the boot camps a lot. Like, I mean, it's

460
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,080
happening in South Africa. Also the thing that you said, where people are contracted out from

461
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,560
European countries, contracting people and they're leaving Brazil. It's a common thing in South

462
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:06,000
Africa as well. People kind of get started here and then they leave the country and they go work

463
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,800
in Europe or they go work in the United States. And one of the problems with that is, is products

464
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:20,000
and ideas and companies and things that started here. They don't have those people with long term

465
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,480
experience. They don't have those. They have a lot of junior people building, building the software.

466
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:32,960
It's the same here. Yeah. So they're missing the guidance from more senior people who can think

467
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,360
long term because they've been through this process before and they can say, well, this looks like a

468
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,920
good idea right now, but it's going to blow up in your face tomorrow or the day after. Because

469
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,040
today our website has 10 people coming to it, but we don't know what's going to happen a month down

470
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:54,160
the line. And this is not going to be sustainable. Like this is not maintainable or whatever the case

471
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:01,440
may be. So it's not uncommon. I think it's very common. And obviously social media and all of that

472
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,480
has played a role in this. It's created this culture of instant gratification. And so people

473
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,160
don't want to wait. And I think that's why a lot of people get frustrated because like you said,

474
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,720
there's unrealistic promises being made. And then when it doesn't go the way that it's been

475
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:25,680
advertised and people think like, oh, this is just nonsense. The whole industry is broken. And it's

476
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:33,600
not that. I think it's part of it that is broken and that we need to change how people sell these

477
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:39,360
things. We need to be realistic. We need to say that it could work for you. You could go to a

478
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,080
bootcamp, do six months, learn React and get a job and be on your way. And you can be happy with that,

479
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:54,160
but it's not a guarantee. So never, never take it as a guarantee. So I can hear that you like to

480
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:01,200
plan long-term and that you think not just for today and tomorrow, but you kind of think long-term.

481
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:07,120
Has there been any books, resources, people, anything like that in your life that has

482
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:13,200
that has helped you with that? Or is this just something that's just natural for you?

483
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,840
I don't know. That's an interesting question because

484
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:30,160
actually, I think when I was raising up, I was taught to avoid risks a lot.

485
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:44,720
But my mother, I think she has this approach of life. Get somewhere safe and be there and like

486
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:53,360
build your home there and don't leave there for anything. So I always been afraid to take risks.

487
01:03:53,360 --> 01:04:02,400
And, but I couldn't be satisfied with what I had. So I had to take risks at some time in my life.

488
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:13,040
So for doing that, I had to plan. Otherwise, I won't stand the anxiety. But I know there's a lot

489
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:20,960
of people that are more spontaneous or impulsive and just go and do it. And I can't, I couldn't do

490
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:31,040
that. And my wife is very much alike. We planned a lot because we have this assumption that

491
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:41,280
if anything could go wrong, it would go wrong with us. But that doesn't prevent us from doing

492
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:52,960
things. Just, I guess a lot of times we feel pessimistic, but I like to think that we are

493
01:04:52,960 --> 01:05:02,800
realistic or like trying to approach that. But we planned a lot, but we don't let this fear or this,

494
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:13,840
we don't let it paralyze us. So planning is like our defense mechanism to not having control of

495
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:22,080
everything. So we have to accept that you don't have control. So if you, if you know about

496
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:28,640
something that could go wrong, make a plan for it. If that happens, you know what to do, but don't

497
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:37,760
freak about it. So it's, I kind of take this for everything in my life. And I learned a lot

498
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:44,000
with investments because you can control what will happen to the world. You can control what

499
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,600
happened to price and everything. So you have to make a plan, stick with the plan and like

500
01:05:49,600 --> 01:06:00,320
believe in it. So you can be all the time reacting to what the world presents to you. So I guess

501
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:11,920
when we started, like after we married and we started, we started thinking about our plans for

502
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:19,920
life and start like saving up money and have to organize it. And we start thinking about it and

503
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:30,240
invest in money to make these plans come true. We kind of learned a lot with it to learn to accept

504
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:39,840
you have no control over what will happen in your country, in the world. It can be a war, a pandemic.

505
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:49,920
I like to say to my eyes, I would never thought I would live through a pandemic in my life.

506
01:06:50,880 --> 01:07:00,480
But when the pandemic hits, we didn't get desperate. We had like a very, we had, we knew

507
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:13,120
what to do. Like we just take a deep breath and like rearrange our planning. Like I sold my motorcycle.

508
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:23,760
I started working from home and everything. So we always like to have options and this come out

509
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:33,680
like planning, but it's not like we are too concerned about the long run that this stop us

510
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:40,080
from going further. But I really like to think that you should have at least a minimum concern

511
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:47,280
what will happen in the long run, because otherwise you will get, like I said, you get surprised by

512
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:54,640
the things that if you really thought about it, it was kind of obvious it could happen.

513
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:00,480
It's not necessarily will happen, but it could happen. So I always like to have a plan in place,

514
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,960
but it's not like an anxious thing to me. It's like I'm defense mechanism too anxious. So I

515
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,680
don't feel anxious because I know that I can deal with things. I've been through a lot of surprises

516
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:23,040
in my life and I passed through it. So it's just be another one. So it will, it will be okay.

517
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:29,520
So yeah, that's a good approach to life. And I think that long-term thinking and that planning

518
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,520
for things that could potentially go wrong, I think that's going to help you a lot when you,

519
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,760
when you code as well, because I think it's something that we do, you know, those statements

520
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:43,600
to say, if this thing is present, then add an event listener to it. Don't just assume it will

521
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:49,040
be on the page because it might not be there. And then it's like, oops, your code is broken.

522
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:55,120
So I think that's going to help you in your code as well. I hope so. Rafaela, this has been lovely.

523
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:00,320
I'm so glad that we could finally connect. It was a really good conversation. In closing,

524
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:08,480
is there anything that you would like to leave the audience with? Any thoughts, any words of inspiration,

525
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:25,840
anything? Maybe speaking of perspective of a beginner, I really, something I struggle a lot

526
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:37,120
is the amount of information, the fear of missing out. And there's a lot of things that are

527
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:49,280
constantly getting to our attention. And I, when I started, that made me real anxious. And I really

528
01:09:49,280 --> 01:10:00,960
started to develop coping mechanisms to this. And what helped me, it was to speak to people. So

529
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:07,840
I spoke with a lot of people. I spoke with people more mature than me. I spoke with

530
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:17,600
younger people than me. And we started realizing that everyone feels like some kind of

531
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:26,640
feels like something similar. And a lot of times in their lives, like every time you have a new job,

532
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:34,480
you move into a new home, you have a new kid, every this, this kind of steps, like

533
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,680
change everything in your life, you have to adapt to it. So it's the same thing as coding,

534
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:52,400
as learning a new skill. So we are always like going to, we always felt like imposters.

535
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:59,120
And then sometimes we felt like, oh, I got this, this is so easy. And then we start to realize,

536
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:05,840
no, it's not that easy. It's really more difficult than I thought. So it's common to see

537
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:12,960
this thing happen to a lot of people in a lot of stages in their professional lives. So this is

538
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,560
like what's most important about communities, like connecting with people, exchanging thoughts,

539
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:26,160
exchanging ideas and exchanging experiences. And that helped me like be really calm about my journey

540
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:32,800
in coding, because on the first months, couple of months, I was really freaking out. Oh my God,

541
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:39,760
I don't think I can do this. I see a lot of things I want to do with this, but I don't think if I'm

542
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:46,080
able to learn how to get there. And then I started realizing a lot of people feel the same way. A lot

543
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:55,360
of people felt the same way when they are starting. So this human connection is, I think, crucial to

544
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:07,040
having this. And that's something a lot of us missed, a lot of us lost on the distance learning.

545
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:13,600
So it's hard to connect with people when you are like in the same class, you have like lunchtime,

546
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:21,760
you like chit chat and everything, you like start to connect it, even if you didn't mean to. But on

547
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:28,800
the internet, you have to have this purpose, you have to do with this intent. You have to reach out

548
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:36,720
to people, you don't have to be ashamed of not knowing what you are doing or spoking the wrong

549
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:45,840
thing. You should at least look for people that are more welcome. But you probably will find a lot

550
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:56,880
of people willing to help you. And that's been my experience and that's been what made me persevere

551
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:06,880
in my studies. And I think it will be like that for all my life because one thing I realized that

552
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:16,320
I will never stop having something to study. The technology changes really fast. So you must

553
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:24,400
like just get used to be a beginner for life. And have this approach and connect with people

554
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,880
that are beginning that field too and that technology and that stack and just go with it.

555
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:37,760
Go with it. Yeah. I think that's great advice. Thanks so much, Raphael, again. Thank you for having
