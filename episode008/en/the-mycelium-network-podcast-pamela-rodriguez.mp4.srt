Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,840
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,520
Hey Pamela, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,480
Hi, thank you so much for inviting me.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
It's a pleasure. How's your day been so far?

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,920
Pretty good. Still short because I'm on Pacific time, so the day hasn't been that long.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,520
Oh, that's right. That's very true. That's very true.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,120
For me, it's like 9 p.m. so I'm completely thinking differently.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,440
So I found you when I reached out on Polywork and asked for people that are interested in

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,880
talking on this podcast. When this podcast was still just an idea in my head,

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,280
now we've like released five episodes. But your story was really interesting and I thought,

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,000
yeah, I definitely need to get you on the podcast. We need like back and forth a little bit and now

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,520
eventually we've made it. What I'd like to start off with is if you can tell us a bit about your

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,920
journey. Where did you start? How did you get to be on today? Yeah, it still goes far back in history

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,720
as you'd like. Sure. Well, I've always been technologically inclined, if you want to call

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,880
it that way, because I'm from the generation that when I was born, there was no computers.

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:29,920
And then when I was a teenager, there was this big boom of computers, but you could not get anything

18
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,240
on the web unless you knew how to code because it was still the time of the angel fire websites.

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:46,080
So I got through there when I was 14 and that sort of got me started and got me to know what I was

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,360
going to do with my life in general, because I was so interested in that part of the new world.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,000
I went into engineering, of course, but I hadn't considered mentoring until late in my career. Well,

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,680
not in my career, but in my college education, reaching out and needing credits to graduate.

23
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,000
They said it was easy to get credits if you taught adults how to use computers. It was not easy at

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,040
all because I had to explain a lot of terminology that I had given for granted. You could not tell

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,200
these people click on the icon because you were speaking Japanese to them. It taught me patience

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,200
and it taught me to look at things always from different points of view, not just my own. So that

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,200
helped me a lot to graduate, not just with my technical skills, but thinking about the people

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,280
that I was interacting with because the fact that someone doesn't know something doesn't make them

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,400
stupid. It just makes them different to you with a different background, a very different background

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,880
sometimes. And I really enjoyed that part, like helping people because going, actually going into

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,600
work, I found out that's not the case. A lot of people don't want to help you, just want to

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,080
advance their own careers. And I think that's a very important thing for everyone to consider

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,920
when they start any career, like helping around you. So I know that you've been involved with

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:32,800
a whole bunch of, let's say, community building and community involvement, especially with

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,320
female coders. Do you want to tell us a little bit about some of these initiatives that you've

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:48,320
started, joined and are currently involved with? Sure. It started a bit personally for me because

37
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,720
a lot of people tried to dissuade me from studying engineering. A lot of people around me were like,

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,440
but it's for men. And at the time I didn't find it offensive or anything. I was genuinely scared.

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,480
I was genuinely scared about it, but my parents were very supportive. That's why I

40
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,080
still went into engineering. But I didn't think about that until I graduated. I mean,

41
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,320
when I was studying, because I was one of two women in my generation of 30 people,

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,640
but after I graduated, it really started manifesting itself because in college,

43
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,840
no one was really mean to me because of me being a woman. But after college, that's when the

44
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,320
hard stuff actually started coming. And I started wondering how I could do something about it, like

45
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,400
not change things per se, because that's a difficult thing to do on the get-go,

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,760
but actually helping people like me just not feel alone because me being the only one of two women

47
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,200
in college started repeating itself in all of my jobs afterwards. Like I was the only woman in the

48
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,520
team. I was the only woman in management and stuff like that. And I was like, I cannot be the only

49
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:18,480
woman all around, but we are all feeling that way. So I was first invited to another event that had

50
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,360
nothing to do with women in tech specifically, but was organized by the chapter of women who called

51
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,800
in the state that invited me. And I was like, oh, this is a great idea. Like women who called,

52
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,280
I'm going to join the one back home. I thought there was one back home because my city was so

53
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,760
much bigger than theirs, but there wasn't. And I was like, this is embarrassing. We're one of the

54
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:54,400
biggest cities in Mexico and we don't have what this little city in the coast has. So I said to

55
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,360
doing it myself because I had to correct that. And that's how I started looking for women that

56
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,640
were interested in doing this because I couldn't do it alone. And that's how we started the

57
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,920
community. And it's now been, I think, like seven years and it's still growing, even though I moved

58
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:24,000
out of Mexico, but I gave it to someone else and they are still going strong, which I'm glad about

59
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,240
because in the first two or three years, if me or my co-director just got out of it, it would have

60
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,960
died. But now it's so strong that it's self-standing and it's a good thing. And the main thing, we

61
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,200
thought we were going to be teaching new stuff to women, but the main thing was just giving

62
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,520
visibility to the women that were actually working. They all had the same story. I'm the only one

63
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,960
where I am, but I see that you are all the only ones, so we're not alone.

64
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:07,120
Yeah. That's interesting. I've heard about this. Interestingly, I've spoken to a couple of people

65
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,760
before in one of the other podcasts and they had a very pleasant experience. And I was surprised by

66
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,720
that because it was also a female because I've heard about this under-representation and about

67
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,520
Twitter, for example, being very toxic for women in tech and that kind of thing. So I'm not

68
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:36,080
surprised by what you said, but I am sad about it. Do you? So I think I want to dig into that a

69
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:44,240
little bit. So for one thing, and answer this in any order that you feel is appropriate. So for one

70
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,800
thing, why do you think there was this idea that tech was mainly for men and not really meant for

71
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,360
women? And then since those days, and with some of these initiatives that you've joined or started,

72
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
do you feel that it's changed significantly?

73
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,480
I think where this idea comes from has been a mystery for me for a long time. And I've been

74
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,880
looking into the answer of that. And a lot of the recently surfaced history has told us a lot about

75
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,040
that. Because if you go back in time, in history, you'll see that when computers started, it was

76
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:32,400
such a repetitive job, boring job, not a job that would give you status. So it started off as being

77
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:39,600
a woman's job. That's why the first coder was Ada Lovelace. And so much of the history of computers

78
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,640
is represented by women, like that very famous movie that came out of the women that were behind

79
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:57,360
the moon launch. But as computers started gaining traction in our everyday life, the jobs started

80
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,320
becoming important. And this is the important part. It's not only engineering. It's not only

81
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,280
computing. If you look around all of the careers, even design, the most representative people are

82
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:22,560
men. So once jobs become important, women start being pushed back from them. And this becomes

83
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,720
more relevant in third world countries. Because I think it's easier for you to talk to someone in

84
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,480
the US, for example, that has a very positive experience. Because there's a lot of laws behind

85
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,520
harassment and, you know, in general, being discriminating to women. But in my country,

86
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,200
in Mexico, there are almost no laws that protect you for anything. So for example, when I was in

87
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,880
Women Who Code, I talked to someone in law about this because we wanted to sort of inform people

88
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:02,480
of what they could do if they were experiencing this. And this girl, this lawyer, told us that

89
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,320
there wasn't really anything that they could do in the courts on just representing themselves as

90
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:19,440
a labor in the labor court. I don't know how to say sorry. But yeah, because, for example, for

91
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:27,040
harassment, they had to have, I believe it was three months of evidence of this happening for

92
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,680
sexual harassment. So we're like, wait, three months? First, you have to endure that three

93
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,640
months. And second, yeah, and second, evidence. Like the worst harassment that you can face,

94
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,720
you probably don't have evidence because not all of your peers are as stupid as to send you

95
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,360
messages, like physical evidence of it. It's probably physical, or it's probably verbal,

96
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,760
and you don't have any evidence of that happening, even though you have endured probably more than

97
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,960
three months because you need that job and you cannot just ask for it. And then you have to

98
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:12,320
not just outright acquit. So she told us that the best bet was to either go to human rights

99
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,320
courts, which was very difficult to win, or to directly go to a CEO of the company and say,

100
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,720
this is happening, and I'm going to go public unless you help me get through it,

101
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,360
like sort of threatening the company. And I found it weird that that was the only defense that we

102
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:37,520
had. Yeah, that's scary, right? I mean, you said the reason people would endure this is because

103
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:45,760
they can't afford to lose the job. So you really, I don't know what the right words are, but you

104
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,440
really need some confidence to walk up to the CEO and be threatening in that way. I mean, obviously

105
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,720
there's different ways you can approach this and be less threatening about it, but when it comes

106
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,360
down to it, in order for anything to change, you do have, at some point you have to make some kind

107
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,080
of threat. I kind of see it almost in the same boat as, I think it's still the case to some extent,

108
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,520
but it's gotten better, but how accessibility on the web has always been addressed. People didn't

109
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,680
really talk about it's the right thing to do, or people didn't say, but it helps other users.

110
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,960
People always ran first to the thing, oh, but do you remember the court case against Walmart and

111
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,640
how much money they were? So, you know, it's always like this legal thing, how you had, it's like,

112
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,520
oh, really, is that, that's what humanity has come down to? If you want. That's what has to happen.

113
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,920
Yeah. If you want anything like to just be normal, then you have to kind of go to court about it and

114
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,640
make a big, and also I guess it's financially straining, right? Also it's not free. I mean,

115
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,720
sure you do get lawyers who are willing to do some of these things pro bono, but

116
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,520
that's not everybody. So first of all, now you have to find the person who's willing to do it

117
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:08,960
like that. Otherwise you have to spend your money to take on somebody who then might lead to you

118
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:17,200
losing your job and not winning the court case. So now you're two for naught. So that is really,

119
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,360
really challenging. And I wanted to leave this question for later, but I think it makes it to

120
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:32,880
bring it up in this context. Like for you as a woman and as somebody in tech, what do you think

121
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,040
is the biggest problems in tech? Do you think it is this or do you think there's a broader problem

122
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,720
or is there two, more than one problem and this is only one of them? Yeah, I think this is only one

123
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,840
of them. This is the one that is gender focused and I'm sure there's a lot of other problems in

124
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,520
diversity, like sexual orientation in general, but I should not speak to that because I'm not involved.

125
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:08,000
But I think if we go to problems specifically with the tech industry, one thing that I've

126
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,240
learned, sort of the hard way throughout the years, is that you should never, and this goes

127
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,120
with the mentoring part, you should never aspire to be the expert in anything because I think it's

128
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,160
just not possible. You can be very good at something, but technology changes so fast

129
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,800
that if you are an expert in something, you're probably just sitting there and being condescending

130
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:43,440
to people. I've found that a lot with people that call themselves experts. They're like,

131
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:54,000
everything should go through me, but you should focus on mentoring, on teaching or helping,

132
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,080
just helping people around you because if you focus in just building your knowledge in this one thing

133
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:09,920
that might not be useful tomorrow, you're just going over, glossing over a lot of very important

134
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:19,120
parts of working in tech, which I don't think, as much as we like to joke about us being introverts,

135
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,600
I don't think tech is that selfish of a job. You cannot really isolate yourself,

136
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,520
even working remotely. You have to always work in a team because you can't do everything.

137
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:38,880
There's so much to do in just one single project. That is very true. Yeah, for sure. I don't know

138
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,960
how much you've thought about this, but I'm assuming you did quite a bit as you are so involved

139
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:51,920
in all of these different causes. With these problems that we now acknowledge openly here

140
00:15:51,920 --> 00:16:01,200
in this podcast, at least, what can we do to make this better? I think it goes down to something

141
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:08,480
very basic, which is that you get what you put out into the world. A lot of people don't think about

142
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:16,240
what they would have wanted when they started their careers. I see not only in tech, in a lot

143
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,160
of careers, my sister is a doctor and she sees that a lot, that if you went through a very hard

144
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,200
time when you started, then you're like, I'm going to make this guy, this new guy, go through a very

145
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:34,720
hard time as well because that's what's going to shape him. That's just not true. Let's break

146
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,720
those toxic environments. Yeah, probably no one helped you when you started, but it would

147
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:51,600
have been easier if someone had. What would you have liked to have when you started? Give that

148
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,120
to the people that are starting now because that makes better teams and that makes them more

149
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:05,920
confident in working with you. That's towards the new people, but also always think when you

150
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:14,320
find someone that is evidently more experienced and more intelligent than you, think about it

151
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:22,080
as a privilege, not as a threat. You can learn so much from this person. There's people that I

152
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,440
haven't reached yet in my development. I know I'm still not there. This person is so good at what

153
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,160
they do, but I'm so glad that they're in my life because I have learned so much from them.

154
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah. I think if you have a job where you don't find someone like that,

155
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,400
you probably need to move because you can't be the sole authority. You need to find people to

156
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:55,440
learn from as well. Yeah. To that point, what role do you see open source play in this? For one,

157
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:04,320
with regards to being more diverse and inclusive, but also to expose you to these people that are

158
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,440
a step above you. Because within a company, even in tech, there is this thing that if you say you

159
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,280
were at a company for three years, you'll be like, whoa, for three years, that's a long time.

160
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,760
Whereas in the olden days, if you want to call it that, it was common to join a company after

161
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,560
you left university and then be there until you're like 65, and then you would go on a pension.

162
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,520
In the tech world, that is like what? No, you move every two years or something like that.

163
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,920
But I think for some people, it's easier than for others, clearly. I wonder if you're not stuck,

164
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,080
but if you're at a company, and maybe you're happy at that company and you don't want to leave,

165
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:57,760
but if you have reached a certain level of seniority where you're basically the senior

166
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,840
of this or the senior of that of whichever team you're working on, do you feel like open source

167
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,280
can play a role there in taking you out of your comfort zone and exposing you to people that are

168
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,480
maybe more experienced than you, essentially, so you can again learn from them?

169
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:22,640
Yes, of course. I think the role of open source has always been crucial in the development of

170
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,040
technology because there's so much work that goes into it just for everyone to learn more and to

171
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,680
build up on it. And it brings you closer to a whole other community that you don't have access

172
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:45,360
at work. And it's definitely a way to look for different challenges outside of your job if you

173
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,680
don't want to move. Because like you said, it's hard for people that really love a job and don't

174
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,560
want to leave. And the culture of, well, it's been three years I have to move. It's hard on those

175
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,920
people. But yeah, starting your own thing is a very good way to deal with that. Because actually,

176
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,200
when I was starting Women Who Code, I was in a company that I was very comfortable with.

177
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,160
So I wasn't thinking about my job as something unstable or something that I had to change.

178
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,840
I could go do my job and then get out of my job at five or six and fully devote myself to

179
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,960
Women Who Code. It's the best possible moment to go into something open source or into some

180
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,600
volunteering work when you are very happy with your day job. Because then that's not something

181
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,160
you need to worry about after you leave. Yeah, because I guess also if you're in a

182
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:51,120
job where you're not happy and I think by the time you leave, you're so drained. The last thing on

183
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,880
your mind is, oh, I'm going to work on this open source thing now. You kind of just want to get on

184
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,800
the couch and just turn on the TV and forget about everything. And more so if you are doing

185
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,280
interviews, because interviewing is like a second job to be studying and doing other things.

186
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah, that's a good topic to bring up. I've asked this of previous people.

187
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,560
And I wonder for you, how have you found the interview process for yourself or maybe for

188
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:30,880
people you know? Well, it has been hard on my little family specifically. Right now, my husband

189
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,960
has a job on Facebook, but he's so good at what he does. But it was so hard for him to get that

190
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,920
kind of job because he's not very good. Well, he wasn't at the beginning. He's practicing now

191
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:48,640
a lot more. He wasn't good at speaking English. And then I think it's something that the interviewers

192
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:57,280
don't really value enough that people need to learn a second language to actually get into

193
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:04,640
tech jobs now. And it's not so easy. People in the US or people in English speaking countries

194
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,720
don't value the learning of languages. They already know the one that is most used in tech.

195
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:20,720
So that's not like a plus for them. And then in my case, when I came here to the US,

196
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,680
I wasn't as technical as I was at the beginning of my career because I went a lot into mentoring

197
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:37,040
and management. And that sort of job is not easy to get when you don't have a work visa.

198
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:47,120
Yeah. Most of my previous experience is not as valued here. It's a weird balance. It's been weird

199
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:55,120
to get used to it. And it's also very hard when you come from a context like mine. In the city

200
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,360
where I was from, because I was the director of Women Who Go, everyone knew who I was.

201
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:07,200
It's so very different to be here and be nobody. But it has been interesting,

202
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,120
an interesting challenge that I can tell you for sure. Though it has given me a lot of more time

203
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:22,400
to do volunteering jobs like the Wheel Project or keeping just with Women Who Go at a distance,

204
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:29,200
which COVID has made easier because now everyone went online even for volunteering stuff.

205
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,880
Exactly. The Wheel Project, I had a quick look at it. Do you want to tell us a little bit more

206
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:46,480
about that? Sure. I met this woman when I was starting Women Who Go, Elena Olazcuaga. And she

207
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,400
hadn't yet started this project, but she has always been very involved, not specifically with tech,

208
00:23:52,400 --> 00:24:00,320
but with empowering women. Because like I said before, women are pushed backwards in all of

209
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,800
the industries, not just tech. And she was baffled by the fact that even though there were a lot of

210
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:15,840
projects that were initiated by women, these women would not speak up about being the main person

211
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,200
behind them. A lot of these projects, they just existed and people didn't know that a woman was

212
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:30,080
behind them. Sometimes because women are taught to be more demure and that it's not nice for you

213
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:38,160
to go around and say, I did this and I did that. And that's why they were invisible. And she did

214
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:44,160
a whole documentary about this. And then she started getting involved more in the tech side

215
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:51,520
because, well, those jobs are getting a lot of importance in our lives now. And that's how she

216
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,560
started this Will project because there's a lot of women that go into science careers, but drop out

217
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,960
at the middle. So the objective of this program was to pair you with someone that was studying

218
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,160
so that they could see someone that already went through it and that could tell you that it was

219
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:21,360
possible and just hear you out and hear your concerns about the industry. And yeah, basically

220
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:29,440
just sort of cheer you on while you were studying. And it was a very interesting point of view because

221
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:38,880
it wasn't necessarily someone that was in your specific career, but it was still science and

222
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:48,560
tech and you shared a lot of the common worries. Yeah. It sounds like a really, really good

223
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:55,760
initiative. I'm just glad to read about it. That brings me to a point that's a little more

224
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,800
positive or happy. What do you enjoy about tech? What do you find interesting? What is

225
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:12,160
your passions? What do you like to do? Well, I especially enjoy the fact that

226
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,160
I feel like you know that you're in the right career when you look around you and a lot of

227
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:26,240
the people are just like you. Because I think that most of the people that are in tech now,

228
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,160
like working in tech, when they were back in school, they were the weird kid. But then you

229
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,160
go into college and you're like, oh, there's more people like me. Even me that I was like

230
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:43,920
just one woman and just one of two women and the rest were men, but they were very much like me.

231
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,760
They enjoyed the same things. They were very open about speaking about what they liked.

232
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,520
You find this very similar mindset and just finding those teams is very rewarding.

233
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,920
I've been talking a lot about the people that go over you and that just advance their careers,

234
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:13,360
but I can actually count those people with my hand. They become like stones in your shoe.

235
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:23,520
Don't get me wrong. The rest of your team always makes it rewarding. I have stayed in jobs that

236
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,720
I find hard to get through the day because my boss suddenly becomes one of these people that

237
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:38,080
just want to step over you. But the rest of my team is so good that I find it hard to just leave

238
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,720
the job because I have built something so great there. That's what I find so rewarding of

239
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,600
technology. Once you find your team, you build a good team. That team is something you want to

240
00:27:51,600 --> 00:28:01,040
work with for as long as you can. Most of them share a lot of your same interests outside of work.

241
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,000
Just in general, that's how you find your... I don't know, not status quo.

242
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,640
Your tribe?

243
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,200
Yeah, your tribe, basically.

244
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,960
I've definitely felt that as well. I think it's interesting. I listened to a talk the other day.

245
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,520
The person talked about social media, and I don't know if you know the person, Yaron Lanier.

246
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,320
He talks quite a lot about... He wrote the book about 10 reasons why you should delete

247
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:38,240
your social media today. He's involved in artificial intelligence and virtual reality.

248
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,880
He's the father of virtual reality, but he is critical of social media. The one thing that he

249
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,960
mentioned that he found particularly interesting is the fact that somehow, Github is getting it

250
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:59,520
right. Because Github, if you think about it, is a social network in a sense, but it's a social

251
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,560
network where there's... What he mentions is there's a sense of ownership, and there's a sense

252
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:16,000
and there's a sense of shared responsibility. It's as if those two things is what's missing

253
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,080
from all these other social networks. Because you have this sense of ownership, this sense of

254
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,360
shared responsibility with these things that you build, it drives out a lot of the negativity and

255
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,600
the toxicity that you find on a lot of social networks. I wonder what you think about that

256
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:44,320
take. I understand that part because I think the bad part about social media, any social media,

257
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:52,240
is that people feel not responsible for what they are posting online, what they're telling you,

258
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,800
how they are attacking you. I've also wondered about the value in it. Of course, when social

259
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:08,480
media first came out, it was just like the shiny new thing. But now that it's become what it's

260
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:18,320
become, it does beg the question, is it worth it? Yeah, because even though I don't use it much for

261
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:28,240
personal reasons, but a very good friend of mine and I have a podcast about books, and just

262
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:36,800
getting people to listen to that is very hard because you have to really put yourself out there

263
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:45,840
and that's something that especially people in tech are not very good at. But it takes a toll

264
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,960
on your mental health if you really get into it. So I do think there's a value in accountability,

265
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,000
which most social media doesn't make you face, the accountability of what you post.

266
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:11,520
Yeah, no, for sure. It definitely creates the opposite. It creates a veneer of perfection

267
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:19,040
over people's lives that's pretentious and untrue. Unfortunately, a lot of people

268
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,880
don't realize that, and then they measure themselves against this unrealistic expectations.

269
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:32,160
And then if they can't measure up, then they blame themselves for that instead of understanding that

270
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:40,800
no, the example that you're looking at is just unrealistic. It's simply not true.

271
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,240
I spoke to somebody the other day where I said this thing about, like he was talking about

272
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,280
showing your weakness and how important that is for mentors, for example, because oftentimes

273
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,480
exactly this thing is being put forth that people do these amazing things and just one

274
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,520
off to the other and you never see the things that don't work. You never see that 20 times

275
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,160
they try to make this thing and didn't get it right. So for mentors, it's important to

276
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:19,360
show your vulnerabilities, to show your failures, your weaknesses. And I was like,

277
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,480
yeah, I totally agree that that's very important and that is definitely part of mentorship.

278
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,560
The problem is even though people talk so much about failure and about failing and trying again,

279
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,160
the context is always the people talking about that are the people that's already made it.

280
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,840
The people who's already running the billion dollar company or the million dollar company

281
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:53,600
and you don't often hear people who are still building their careers, building their knowledge

282
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,560
talk about the same things. For them, I think the message is different. The message is

283
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:05,760
hide your failures, hide your weaknesses. Yes, and that's part of like sort of what

284
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,200
come to the real world of the social media, I think. But it's easy to forget that when you're

285
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,560
trying to help someone that you're being a mentor to someone, you need to also talk about your

286
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,560
background. Like, yes, you made a mistake right now. And I know it's a mistake because I've made

287
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,480
it before. I went through this and something similar happened. So let me tell you so that you

288
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,280
don't need to go through it again. But it's very important to be humble about the way that you

289
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,120
learn the things. I wasn't born knowing that I should not have said what you just said right now.

290
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,520
I also had to navigate, but I'm glad that you don't have to navigate this alone.

291
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,640
Like you said, sometimes it has more value coming from someone that's not Elon Musk,

292
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:08,320
basically. So touching on that point of people who are insanely successful,

293
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:17,760
has there been any people or moments or events in your life? And you can have multiple. There

294
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,120
doesn't just have to be one. You can talk about multiple of these that you feel has been pivotal

295
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:31,040
or particularly impactful in your life up to now. Yeah, it's probably going to sound like

296
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:38,240
really small things. At the time, I didn't see it as small, but now thinking back to it,

297
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:49,120
it's probably a small thing. The first time I was in charge, for example, of a meeting at a job

298
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:55,280
of travel, that we had to travel somewhere else to see a client. And I was in charge of the meeting

299
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:04,160
of selling this new product. And I was there with a senior architect, and he would just be there to

300
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,880
advise me. He would not participate in the meeting. So after we had this meeting, this whole day of

301
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,480
meetings and presentations that I was a lead for, at the end of it, we were just having dinner

302
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,760
somewhere. And he started just going over feedback for me. And I immediately got out something to

303
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:31,760
write on and I started to take notes. And after he was done, he was like, I'm sorry if I offended

304
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,160
you. And I was like, what? You were giving me feedback. He's like, yeah, but I have done the

305
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:45,680
same thing for people before. And sometimes I've made people cry or just really angry. And I was

306
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,480
like, but you were not disrespectful. You didn't say, oh, you idiot, or something like that.

307
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:00,080
He was really specific about what I had done that I could improve on. And I realized that

308
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,760
not only was he good at taking feedback, but I was good at receiving it. And receiving feedback

309
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:15,920
is a really hard thing to do. I hadn't thought about that before. I thought back on myself just

310
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,880
10 years before that moment. And I thought, well, probably 10 years ago, I would have gotten mad

311
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,600
that he didn't just say good job or something positive. But I was already experienced enough

312
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:36,240
to know that it was valuable to listen to him. And that's something that stayed with me since then,

313
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,320
that you need not only to be good at giving feedback, but at receiving it.

314
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,200
Because receiving feedback always can feel like they are attacking you when they are actually

315
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,240
trying to help you. And I think that's probably one of the things that's tricky with open source.

316
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,640
And I think that is why a lot of new people maybe are a little bit scared. I mean, that's

317
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,320
my experience from having spoken to a couple of people very new to development, is they really

318
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,960
want to contribute to open source. But beyond the tools and all these things that they still

319
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:27,360
don't know exactly how to use, it's more afraid of looking stupid, afraid of asking something that

320
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,760
for them is not obvious, but they're scared the other person might think like,

321
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,400
oh, you're wasting my time. Why are you, you know?

322
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Yeah. And that's where the social media mentality comes into play because a lot of people feel

323
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,440
entitled to answer that way, to just be like, that's a silly question. Or the other way around,

324
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,840
when you're the owner of the open source project, there's a lot of people that actually think they're

325
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:06,000
entitled to telling you, why didn't you do it this way? This was a better way. And it's hard

326
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:15,120
to navigate that sort of mentality, but you need to take it one at a time, I think, and not lose

327
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:21,120
sight of what's important because there's always going to be people that react that way. Also in

328
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:27,440
feedback in your job, because there's always going to be someone that is going to give you

329
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:35,440
the wrong feedback or just not know how to politely tell you the feedback. And again,

330
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:44,480
this is because I am coming from the context of Mexico, but I once had one colleague that's now

331
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,080
a very good friend of mine, called me out to ask for feedback and I gave her feedback.

332
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,880
And she was like, well, this is not what I was expecting because the feedback that I got

333
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,240
was that I didn't smile enough. And I was just so mad about that. Like,

334
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,560
yes, there's feedback that everyone has feedback, that we're not perfect about what we're doing,

335
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,360
but we need to be very careful about what we choose to tell people when we're giving feedback.

336
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,640
Do you have any tips for people around that? Like how to construct good feedback?

337
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:32,080
Good feedback. Sure. I think it's probably something that sounds obvious, but it's not

338
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:38,480
that obvious when you're putting it into practice. You need to always focus on their job performance

339
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,160
because there's stuff that you want to probably say that you don't like about someone.

340
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,080
There's always something that you're not going to like about someone, but that is not important.

341
00:39:50,080 --> 00:40:01,520
And if this particular trait is affecting how they are portraying their work, then go ahead,

342
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:09,360
but it's very important to take it one step at a time. Like I have this coworker that would find

343
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:15,200
it very hard to conceal his facial expressions. So whenever a client said something that he

344
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,640
considered stupid, it would show on his face, which is something that you find really funny

345
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:30,640
in a friend, but not in a colleague. So I had to be very careful on how I was going to tell him

346
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,040
that because it's not like I don't like how your face looks and you need to control your facial

347
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,960
expressions more because you may be getting yourself into trouble with the clients that way.

348
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:50,320
Like we know you, we know that's how you are. The client doesn't. And so if you're getting into

349
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,000
something so personal, you need to be very specific about why that is affecting their job

350
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:03,600
and not why you don't like it. So I have a question that I ask like mentors and teachers

351
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,600
and stuff, but I'm going to change how I ask this one a little bit. I would normally ask like

352
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,000
as a mentor or teacher, what advice do you have for people near to the industry? But I want to

353
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:23,600
change it up a little bit. And I'm thinking, why would you tell somebody, irrespective of background

354
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,760
or gender or any of those things, just in general, why should somebody get into tech?

355
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:39,920
First, I think the best reason for getting into tech and that's, this is something that

356
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,680
my parents and people that were trying to cheer me on when I was first starting to, was first going

357
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,480
to choose a career for college. They told it to me a lot of times. Going into an engineering,

358
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,920
a tech career doesn't mean you need to end up doing exactly what you studied because it opens

359
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:09,200
your mind to so much. You can end up somewhere entirely different, but the fact that you have

360
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:17,840
that base study makes it easier. For example, I really liked writing when I was in high school

361
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:25,120
and a lot of people told me that I should go into that sort of career, like creative writing. Why

362
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:34,560
waste my time in science if I was good at writing? And what people cheering me on told me was like,

363
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,080
you will always be able to write if you go into tech, but if you go into writing,

364
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:45,680
you will not be able to do tech because you did not go into math. You didn't take all of

365
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:53,840
these other classes because it's more specific, it's science and writing is easier to take on

366
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:04,480
your own. I was able to continue writing and for a long time I wrote articles for blogs and stuff.

367
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,160
I haven't dropped anything that I liked to do before tech, but I would have probably dropped

368
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,640
tech altogether if I had gone into any of those other things.

369
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:28,400
There are so many things one can talk about, about all these different challenges, but also

370
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,840
the joys of being in tech. I think for me, one of the things that's really enjoyable is solving

371
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:47,280
problems. I think if you don't like to constantly have to face problems and solve them, then getting

372
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,320
into the engineering tech industry is probably not for you because that is a constant. Whether

373
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:00,640
you're a designer or whether you're a coder or whether you're a blend of the two, that is

374
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,280
constantly what you're doing is you're constantly solving problems, whether it is solving a user

375
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,040
interface problem, whether you're solving a business problem, or whether you're solving

376
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,920
something really engineering. How do we ensure that this system will scale if tomorrow a million

377
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:25,200
people start visiting our website? Do we need a database? If we do, which is the appropriate

378
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,560
one? There's constant problem solving. There's constantly taking a thing, unpacking it, breaking

379
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,640
it down into pieces, and then putting it all back together again with a solution. Another

380
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,680
thing that's a big part of being in tech and being a coder and working with others is planning,

381
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,440
and that's hard. I find that extremely hard. I find it not so hard to plan. I find it hard

382
00:44:51,440 --> 00:45:00,320
to estimate. I know I'm not alone in that, but it's still a reality for me. After, I don't know,

383
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:07,200
15 years of doing this, every sprint, I would think that I'll get a certain thing done,

384
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,880
and by the end of the sprint, I'm like, I guess I underestimated again.

385
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:19,600
Yes, I think there's the incorrect notion that you don't need creativity to be a coder,

386
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,360
but there's so much of that. Oh, that's completely wrong.

387
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,760
Because they think, oh, you're such squares and you're not creative. There's so much

388
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:38,240
creativity and planning that goes into actually having scalable code and code that can be

389
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:49,040
maintained by others and can grow. I think the fact that we are so behind mathematics and

390
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,600
diagrams and stuff that it might put people off and give them the wrong idea,

391
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,560
but it not only needs a lot of creativity, but it also helps people. Like I said before,

392
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:10,640
most of us have this profile that we're not good with people, but even if that's the case,

393
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:18,480
tech helps you be good with people because you need to understand them at a data level

394
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:26,400
to actually build something that makes sense. So it makes you become better with people,

395
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,680
even if you weren't at the beginning. That's something that I found really interesting

396
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,160
because you start seeing everything as a problem to solve and dealing with people is also that

397
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:48,320
at its basis. It is. Yeah, no, definitely. I was thinking of some places where I was

398
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:55,200
thinking and it slipped my mind now. Yeah, I'll probably remember in a second. Are there any

399
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,520
projects or side projects, big personal projects, something that has nothing to do with tech

400
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,280
that you're particularly proud of and would like to share a bit more about?

401
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:16,000
Well, I've always been proud of Women Who Code, but that's entirely in tech.

402
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Like I said, we were trying to start a podcast about books because I've started off being

403
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,600
pushed into writing because I wrote a lot and I still read a whole lot. I have this

404
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:43,840
literature part of my personality that I just like analyzing whatever I read.

405
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:51,040
And that's what we were starting me and another friend. And I think the main reason it's been

406
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,160
hard is because it's entirely in Spanish and it gains less traction if it's not in English.

407
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:04,080
But we wanted to still make it in Spanish for our community because there's also something that

408
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:10,240
makes you a bit sad about that tendency of making everything in English. Like you want to give

409
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,520
you want to give something back in your own language. And that's why we have stuck to

410
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:25,280
making it in Spanish and feeling more free that way. We're a very small podcast, but I'm still

411
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,040
very proud of the work that we do of reading books and analyzing them and summarizing them

412
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:40,720
and talking about how certain characters portray things from our society today or in history.

413
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:47,120
And that's, like I said, is something I don't want to stop doing because it's very different

414
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:55,120
from tech and connects me to another artistic world. Yeah, that's very important to do that.

415
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:00,480
I used to, before I got into tech, I used to be a professional musician.

416
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:10,800
And I kind of, I've let that go for a while and I picked it up again. But then the other day,

417
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:18,800
I was listening to a podcast of Lex Friedman. And he also talked about how if you've been at

418
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:25,840
a certain level with, it doesn't matter what, in my case, it's with a musical instrument, and

419
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,600
you then stop for a long period of time and you pick it up. It's literally painful,

420
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:41,440
the emotional pain you go through of realizing how much you've lost. And it's hard. It's almost,

421
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,360
no, not almost. It is harder than when you first started. Because when you first started,

422
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:52,480
you had nothing to compare yourself against other than other people. You can compare yourself against

423
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,880
like a great guitarist, but that's cool. That's inspirational. But now you compare yourself against

424
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,880
who you used to be able to, how you used to be able to play. And that is really painful because

425
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,520
you pick up this piece of music and you're like, okay, I'm going to try this. And you just cannot.

426
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,840
It's just too difficult. Your hands doesn't want to do it. Your brain doesn't want to play along.

427
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:21,280
And you have all of these mixed emotions that happens in your body and you just put it down

428
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,440
because it's just too painful. So I do think that it's important to not let go of our hobbies,

429
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:37,280
not let any one thing consume you entirely. Because balance is important in life and

430
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:44,880
you need different ways of giving expression to your emotions that you feel. And I mean,

431
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,560
for some people, tech can fill all of those roles and that's great. But I think if you do

432
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:56,320
have other things, you shouldn't put them on the side just because now you're in tech. So that's

433
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,080
where all your attention should be and all your free time should also be spent on side projects

434
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,200
and stuff like that. I think if that is your thing and it works for you and it makes you happy,

435
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,880
then great. But if there are other things that you're interested in, you should continue to

436
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:24,880
pursue them. Yes. And it's very easy to get sucked into that mentality because I think part of what

437
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:32,480
social media has done is that it sort of portrays people in tech as always being consumed by tech.

438
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:39,120
And you feel like you have to go that way. When I was fresh out of college,

439
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:48,080
I had a blog and that's what I was doing 24-7, reading about tech and writing about tech and

440
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,560
even outside of my job. And I stopped reading, I stopped drawing, which I also liked,

441
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,080
which is why I understand your pain because I was very good at digital drawing. And when I

442
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,960
picked it up again, I was so, so frustrated just looking back on what I had been able to do before.

443
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,720
And like I said, if you go that way of consuming yourself entirely in tech,

444
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:19,840
it has to be because you want to, not because you feel like that's what you have to do.

445
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:28,640
Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Well, this was a really, really good conversation. It was so wide,

446
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,200
but it was really interesting and I think it will be a good one for people to listen to.

447
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,200
I probably had a different thing that I was going to ask you at the end,

448
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,320
but I'm going to change that again because of something that you said.

449
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:51,440
As an avid reader and somebody who loves books clearly, what is your top three favorite books?

450
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,760
It doesn't matter language. It doesn't matter the language.

451
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:03,680
That is so hard. It sort of changes with the years because like just to give you a perspective,

452
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:11,840
this year I have read 93 books. So it's hard for me to just outright give you just three.

453
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:21,120
What is three books you've recently read that has really had an impact on you?

454
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:29,680
Yes, that's easier to answer. There's this book because I also, apart from literature,

455
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,600
I really like non-fiction. There's this book called No Man's Land that plays very well into

456
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:43,200
what we were talking about right now, but more in the context of medicine and the First World War,

457
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:51,200
how women were not even allowed to study medicine. And then suddenly there were no men because they

458
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:58,240
were all fighting and they needed women to get into these roles and how this was the first rise

459
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:07,600
of women in professional medicine, not confined to gynecology or to pediatricians. And it's a very,

460
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:14,400
it's a very, very interesting read. Not just because of that breakthrough in professional

461
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,600
medicine for women, but because of what happened afterwards that they were again pushed out.

462
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:27,360
All of their hospitals closed and given to men and how the fight didn't end there.

463
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:37,440
Or that's one very good book, No Man's Land. For just general literature, there's this other book,

464
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,280
it's fiction. It's called The Invisible Life of Adi Larue. You're probably seeing

465
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:53,280
how I look for strong women characters, but it was a long time in my life where I

466
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:01,920
didn't have access to that because everyone wants a man. And I didn't realize it until now.

467
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:09,040
It's this woman that suddenly is granted immortality and how she navigates life that

468
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:16,880
way, like fighting against this demon that gave her immortality. And he keeps telling her that

469
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,800
he'll take it all away if she just surrenders. But she's so stubborn that she prefers to suffer

470
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:29,200
through immortality than to say, okay, I give up. And I relate to that so much.

471
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:39,520
And then just for anyone that has children, like I don't have children, but I'm about to.

472
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:50,400
There's this very nice series of books called A Catawitch by an African American author.

473
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:59,840
It's a black girl from Nigeria who has albinism and has always had this identity crisis because

474
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:06,960
they called her the white girl, but she's not technically white. She has albinism. And then

475
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:14,160
she discovers that her disadvantage actually in another world gives her magical powers.

476
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,400
And it's the same for her friends that one has dyslexia and that means he's very good at

477
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,320
spells in this other world. I found it very uplifting that the fact that they have dyslexia

478
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:33,040
or ADHD or albinism makes them better somewhere else. So if you have kids that are suffering

479
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,800
through that, these are very good books for that. That sounds incredible. And I mean,

480
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:47,760
I think that ties into reality, right? I think a lot of people, sometimes, I don't want to say

481
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:58,640
disability. What's the word I'm looking for? I don't know, something that makes you disadvantaged

482
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:08,160
maybe in one area can actually be a strength somewhere else. And I think it leads to this

483
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:15,040
idea of there is something for all of us in this world. It's just finding that tribe, like what

484
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,640
you talked about, finding that tribe, finding that passion, finding that field that just makes you

485
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:31,760
happy. And I think then all these other things that goes around it, having albinism or being ADHD

486
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:40,160
or any of these things, they can actually become strengths. Also sometimes when you don't see them

487
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:46,800
as disadvantages, because I think oftentimes we see things as disadvantages and we kind of

488
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:53,040
break ourselves down. And sometimes we have to ask the question of, but why does this give me,

489
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,360
how does this give me a unique perspective on life that somebody who doesn't have to deal with this

490
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:08,160
thing doesn't have? And what about that can I use to give myself an advantage in life? It's like

491
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,320
looking at your disadvantages and asking yourself, what has that taught me about life? And how can I

492
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,040
use those lessons to have an advantage over somebody that didn't have that challenge? I think

493
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,400
you've kind of hinted at that in the beginning as well with a lot of this, especially you having

494
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,640
like a really hard time coming up as an engineer and in the engineering and science field in Mexico,

495
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,920
in third world country. Whereas if you speak to somebody in the US, they might have a completely

496
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,640
different experience because there's a bigger support system. It's more visible. Other people

497
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:47,280
that are similar to you. And I think these books that you also find that you feel so close to,

498
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:53,760
I think they're filling a void that's been there before, where there wasn't this representation

499
00:58:53,760 --> 00:59:01,920
of these strong females that has taken on the world, taken on a demon and won. So yeah,

500
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,080
I think it's really, really interesting. I can keep talking and talking and talking,

501
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:11,040
but at some point, I guess we have to stop. So thanks so much for joining, Pamela. I really,

502
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,800
really enjoyed it. All of the best with everything you do. Thanks so much for all the things you do.

503
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:23,600
I think it's really, really important work. And I hope that this small little podcast that I run

504
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:30,000
gives you a bit of a, makes people a little bit more aware of the stuff you do and gets you a

505
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:36,080
little bit more recognition and helps other people join in. So thank you so much.

506
00:59:36,080 --> 01:00:04,160
Thank you for inviting me. It was a great conversation.

507
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,160
in the show notes.
