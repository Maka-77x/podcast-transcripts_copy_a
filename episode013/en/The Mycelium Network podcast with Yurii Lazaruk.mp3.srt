00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to the Marseillean Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,320
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,520
Hey, Yuri.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,120
Thank you for joining me for the podcast.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,120
I'm really excited.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,800
Hey, Shauk.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Thank you for having me.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,640
I'm happy to be here.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,880
So in the past, I've kind of read out a little bio of people, but I thought that's super

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,440
boring and it's been done.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,880
So what I like to do is I like to give you the floor and say, tell us about who you are

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,120
and take as much time as you need, go back as far as you need, tell us your story.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,480
So you want to ask me how did my parents born me?

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,360
That's maybe a little too far back.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:59,680
Okay, so I'm a community builder right now and I love it very much, but I trapped, let's

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,280
say trapped into the community world very, like I didn't think that I will be a community

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,480
builder because I was doing a lot of stuff.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,440
I was a risk analyst in the bank.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:22,200
I was running my internet shop and then somehow, just because of this internet shop, I've made

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,600
some SEO for it and I hired people to do it and they did a bad job.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,520
So I decided to learn SEO.

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,200
So I went to an SEO forum, started learning.

23
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,760
That's how I understood that they were doing not a good job.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,760
And while learning SEO, I started talking to people, connecting to them.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,920
And one day I saw a message that it will be a meetup somewhere in other city.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,760
And then I was like, okay, why don't we have an SEO meetup in Kiev?

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,460
So I just created a post and basically that's how my first community SEO club started.

28
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:09,520
And we just connected, we just had a conversation, we just had some pizza and we liked it so

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:17,920
much that during the time, some time, it became an SEO club, the best well-known community

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,200
of SEO experts in Ukraine.

31
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:30,480
So after that was like a marketing club, CPC Real Talk is a community for advertisers who

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,420
work with paid advertisement.

33
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,420
And also I'm running a sales hero community in Ukraine, it's for salespeople for sure.

34
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:45,560
And when the war started in Ukraine on 24th of February, basically I've lost my any sources

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,560
of income because it was dependent on community, I made it some courses and all this stuff.

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,000
But for sure, people didn't need to learn and all this, they needed to understand how

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,840
to survive.

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,720
And at that point, I just reached out to David Spinks, the founder of the CMX community and

39
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,680
told him that, hey, David, I have this experience and I'm in trouble, I need some community

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,800
job, I need something to do.

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,080
And he told me, yeah, okay, I will help you, he made a post.

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,840
That's how I found, that's how I met Steve Gargiulo from the cultivators community, we're

43
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,040
still working with them.

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,200
And that's how I started doing an audit for a CMX community.

45
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,600
So it helped me a lot to support me and my family during the hard times.

46
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,040
And that's how I basically become an international community, not only builder, but a consultant

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
too.

48
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,240
So it was really very fast.

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,080
So I was building my communities, Ukrainian communities for seven years.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,560
Five of those years, I didn't even know that it called community building.

51
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,340
I thought that I just meet great people and we have some good time.

52
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,760
And then I joined the CMX community, I understood that I'm not alone in this community world.

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,200
And yeah, basically, that's how I started being a community, international community

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
person.

55
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Great.

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,520
That's a really good story.

57
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm glad that you had people to reach out to and that people helped you.

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,560
So I'm really grateful for that.

59
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,720
But you know, also it was not in a second.

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,840
So I was kind of building these connections.

61
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,720
So I joined CMX community like two years before and I was there.

62
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,400
I was communicating with people, but I just never get to know other people very good.

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,760
But at least they knew me.

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,680
So I was not like a person from the street.

65
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

66
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,120
Yeah, I get that.

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Cool.

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,640
So do you want to talk a little bit about the Community Life podcast?

69
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,120
Seeing that you're on a podcast.

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,520
Yes, yes, yes.

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,440
It was it was my idea I started in the sales hero community.

72
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,480
So what was the idea behind it?

73
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,640
I just choose great people, great experts from the sales world.

74
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,920
And we go with them and we have just this conversation about themselves.

75
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,560
So it's not about titles.

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,640
It's not about some tricks.

77
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,380
It's just about people.

78
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,400
So I'm really curious, who are their parents?

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Like where did they born?

80
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,440
How their childhood looked like?

81
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,760
And all this stuff.

82
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,000
Like I just I'm just curious.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,880
I just want to know these people better.

84
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,640
And we are having this conversation.

85
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,080
We can understand how to be a successful salesperson here.

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,040
Like what skills do you need?

87
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,280
Who are those people who are great?

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:55,560
And like when I become, let's say, international expert, I decided, OK, so why don't we have

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,320
this conversation with community experts?

90
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,320
And I just once again, I just reached out to David Spinks with this crazy idea.

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,080
Tell them, hey, David, I have this idea.

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
Why don't we try?

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,320
And he was like, sure, I've never done this before.

94
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,520
Let's do it.

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,760
So it was my first, let's say, episode.

96
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,580
And by now, I had a conversation with 18 amazing people so far.

97
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,560
And I keep going, you know, just one new conversation every week.

98
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,520
So it helps me a lot.

99
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,880
Like as I told, I'm really curious about people and it helps me very much to understand those

100
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,040
people who I am talking to in the community world.

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,680
And I really do not hunt an audience.

102
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know how many people listen to those podcasts.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,040
But once again, the main idea is that at the moment, there are just two people, me and

104
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,600
the guest, we are talking about their lives.

105
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,200
And it's just very, you know, it's just very emotionally connected experience.

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,680
And I just love it.

107
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,120
So and also people who listened to podcasts, they told me that they love it, too.

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,080
So you know, click, match.

109
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Let's do it.

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Yeah, exactly.

111
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,760
That's exactly how I feel about this experience.

112
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:20,640
I mean, this I've recorded probably about 15 now we've released 12.

113
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,920
But it's also the conversations are just it's just wonderful.

114
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,560
I get to speak to really different people from all walks of life from different places

115
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,300
in the world and get to hear their stories and what makes them excited and the struggles

116
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,300
they have.

117
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,080
And that leads you to start thinking like, how can I help?

118
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,520
Like, what can I do to help these people?

119
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,320
Sometimes you also connect over similar challenges, like maybe like I'm from a third world country.

120
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,240
So if I speak to somebody else's also in a developing country, oftentimes they tell me

121
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,520
a story and I'm like, oh, my goodness, I can so relate because I've also experienced this.

122
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
But I've had some some luck.

123
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,360
Maybe some of it I created for myself, some of it just came across my path.

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,680
And through that, I'm able to use my connections to help these people.

125
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,400
And so, yeah, I I'm also like, I don't know how many I've some rough ideas how many people

126
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
listen to the show.

127
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,960
But that's not the most important thing to me.

128
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,960
To me, it's more like if somebody like my daughter, for example, she told me the other

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,720
day she started listening to the podcast and she can't stop.

130
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,520
And I was like, that's lovely.

131
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
I love that.

132
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,000
I love that somebody that's like an author, who's a little curious about coding and stuff

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,600
like that, but who likes stories, enjoy the podcast, because that's what I want it to

134
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
be.

135
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,760
It's about people telling stories about their life and about what they what's hard and what's

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
what's not.

137
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,840
People love to talk.

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,840
And if you if you are asking them about themselves, they will really share.

139
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,520
So they will share everything you will ask you.

140
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,720
You have to just ask it.

141
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
Yeah, yeah, that's very true.

142
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,440
And I've also found that you shouldn't be scared to reach out to people.

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,480
I think it's it's amazing how many people are willing to to talk to you.

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,600
So what I was what I was going to say is we had this conversation scheduled for a little

145
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,080
earlier than we're doing it now.

146
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,560
And it's because you said you had this between two water coolers meeting.

147
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,440
And I was like, that sounds interesting.

148
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
I've heard about between two ferns.

149
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,560
What is this between two water coolers thing?

150
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Yeah.

151
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,320
So it's it's a super fast.

152
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,160
Yeah, it was I was motivated by between two ferns.

153
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,400
So I decided I even have this picture of Zach Galifianakis staying between two ferns.

154
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:54,880
And there are a lot of there are photos from our every meeting behind him like on the wall.

155
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,200
So this is a picture for between two water coolers meeting.

156
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,980
And what is the idea that you go there?

157
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:14,320
We collect some community experts and we just have three rounds of five minutes of communication.

158
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,280
So we just go to one on one breakout rooms.

159
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,360
We meet each other.

160
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,760
We talk about everything we want for five minutes, three times.

161
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,280
And we have just really quick and fun experience.

162
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,320
It allows us to build these connections to get to know each other a little better.

163
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,440
And also, there is no obligations.

164
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,500
You don't have to talk for half an hour or an hour.

165
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,400
So if you clicked, you can continue your conversation in the community world.

166
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,640
You can even go for a Zoom call.

167
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,380
You can even meet in person.

168
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,080
If you don't click, once again, no expectations.

169
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,040
Just go to another person.

170
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:00,720
So it's kind of, let's say, networking, speed networking or speed dating networking, something

171
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
like that.

172
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,920
But once again, the main idea is that it's super cool, super fast, super fun.

173
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,240
And just 20 minutes a week, you don't have to spend a lot of time to meet amazing people.

174
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,360
And once again, it's all about connections.

175
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,760
It's all about meeting new people.

176
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
But just another way of doing it.

177
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Yeah.

178
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,680
And is this open to anybody?

179
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,360
How do you go about joining it?

180
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Totally open to everyone.

181
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,880
I just hosted in the CMX community because I love CMX community and it helped me a lot

182
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,480
during my life and during all this war stuff.

183
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,280
And it's kind of my, let's say, I want to give back something.

184
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:49,280
That's why I'm hosting these events in the CMX community every week, every Friday.

185
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,540
So I just love it and people love it.

186
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,880
So once again, one more click, one more match.

187
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,760
Yeah, that's great.

188
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,880
I started using this app that's still in very early development called Groove.

189
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,700
And the idea there is that it's also people from all over the world.

190
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,560
Currently, it's on your phone, but they think they're looking at making a desktop version

191
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,280
of it as well.

192
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,920
And so you'd say, I want to start a groove and then it would notify some people.

193
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,740
And then they can decide to join the groove.

194
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,760
And then everybody gets on camera and you say like, what do you want to try and do in

195
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,760
the next 50 minutes?

196
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,280
And then you say, OK, let's do it.

197
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,800
And then everybody goes away and have a little chat window open.

198
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
And then people do their jobs and they like try to tickle stuff if they get it done.

199
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,980
And then after 50 minutes, everybody comes back together and you basically give a status

200
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,520
update of what you were able to do in the 50 minutes.

201
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:54,280
And yeah, if you work remotely and you work in, I don't know, you just feel sometimes

202
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,280
you feel a little lost, a little alone, maybe like you need that human connection.

203
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:06,360
And I love all these opportunities that are starting to happen on the Internet for people

204
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,360
to connect in all kinds of different ways.

205
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,840
In preparation for this, I kind of looked at your Twitter and your LinkedIn and stuff

206
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,500
like that to kind of learn more about who you are.

207
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:27,320
And so one of the things that I've realized is that you're somebody who loves people and

208
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,840
who have a generally very positive attitude towards life.

209
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:41,400
And I won't say I will definitely not say that I dislike people, but sometimes but sometimes

210
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:49,840
I get down about what we do to each other and and our planet and things like that.

211
00:13:49,840 --> 00:14:01,800
So I read a tweet where the question was, if you weren't scared of failure, what would

212
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,400
you do?

213
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:10,160
And you replied to that exactly what I was doing now, just without fear.

214
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,960
And so that suggests to me that fear is not something that stops you.

215
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:22,560
So how did you get to this place where you can be okay with the fear?

216
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:31,800
You know, you never can be okay with the fear, because it's something that lives with us,

217
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,200
but you have you can have different response, you can, you know, you can fight or flight.

218
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:45,680
So here is the same, like I can, like, froze and stay and be afraid of everything and not

219
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,700
do nothing, or the fear is motivating me, you know, when if I'm afraid of something,

220
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,300
it means that I'm going out of my comfort zone.

221
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:02,560
And most likely, if I didn't receive results, I wanted most likely I need to go out of my

222
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,880
comfort zone and try something new.

223
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,800
So that's how I learned not to be afraid of doing something new of trying of making mistakes

224
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,080
and what like, what we really fear, what we're really afraid of is to make mistakes.

225
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:27,520
And even more what other people will will think about us, if we will make those mistakes.

226
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,040
But you know, it's like it's natural for people to make mistakes.

227
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
And it's not a mistake.

228
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,360
It's the way we learn, because, you know, when children starts start going, they're

229
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,440
falling so many times, but they continue trying to walk.

230
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,360
And then they're walking without even thinking about it.

231
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,320
So why are we afraid to try to walk?

232
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,800
We need to try, we need to try, we need to fall many times, we need to hurt our legs,

233
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,320
we need maybe even to hurt our head sometime, like not literally, but in general.

234
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,880
But that's the only way like, you know, some people say that you can learn by seeing and

235
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,240
reading about others mistakes.

236
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,580
But no, the best way to learn is to make your own mistakes.

237
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:28,120
And I love this saying from the line chocolate advertisement, that if you will forgive my

238
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,240
imperfection, I'll forgive yours.

239
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,740
So basically, that's how I feel.

240
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,680
And if I'm making mistakes, if somebody will point that I'm making a mistake without saying

241
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,120
how to make it better, I will just not care about it.

242
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,160
So if somebody will say that I made a mistake and help me to not to make this mistake in

243
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
the future, I will really appreciate it.

244
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,760
And that's how we'll build our connections.

245
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,360
And that's how we become friends, you know, otherwise, like, why care?

246
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,320
I mean, that leads into another one that where you said that it is 100% okay to say I don't

247
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,400
know.

248
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,160
And I agree with that.

249
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,300
I don't allow myself that often.

250
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,720
But when I catch myself in those moments, I'm like, hey, whoa, stop.

251
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,800
It's okay to say you don't know.

252
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,860
It's actually it means that this is a learning opportunity, right?

253
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,020
If it's something you don't know, well, are you interested in knowing this thing?

254
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:38,880
And if so, wow, we're in the age where content is, there's too much, you actually, we're

255
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,520
drowning in information.

256
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,600
So if you don't know, you can learn.

257
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,440
Yes, it, it saves a lot of time, because you can talk to a person.

258
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,560
And the person will say some words, some, I don't know, meanings or something that you

259
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,740
don't know.

260
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,080
And you can say that, oh, I'm sorry, but can you explain me this?

261
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
I just don't know.

262
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,920
I just don't understand.

263
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,960
And person will explain you this in two minutes.

264
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,880
And you will save a lot of time because you don't have to try things out and you will

265
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,920
understand each other.

266
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,440
And there will be no, you know, this going back and forth, trying to understand what

267
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,560
that person really mean, because you will understand it right away and it will save

268
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,560
a lot of time and nerves and sometimes even money.

269
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,420
Yeah, very true.

270
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:37,600
So I know that you're mostly focused on like community building and in sales and that kind

271
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
of thing.

272
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,160
But I think technology is part of all of our lives.

273
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,320
I mean, we're using it right now to be able to have this conversation.

274
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,760
So I'm curious, do you have any thoughts about the tech industry?

275
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,120
Just like a high level, like somebody from the outside, like if you're looking at the

276
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,760
tech industry from the outside, why do you think about this industry, like the good and

277
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
the bad?

278
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:11,400
It's a really big question because what I recently saw, like from community side of

279
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,240
tech industry, it's many layoffs and all this stuff.

280
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,360
So I'm like thinking from this point, from human point of view, and I don't really like

281
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,600
it right now because many amazing people lost their jobs and all this, and all they're going

282
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,000
through these difficult challenges, et cetera.

283
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,200
But in general, if we're not talking about the human side, if we're talking about technologies,

284
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,360
it's definitely amazing that we even have, you know, I'm in one place of the world, you

285
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,680
and another, and we still have this conversation.

286
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:50,320
So it allows us to connect, like not taking in the mind the whole distance between us

287
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:58,680
so, like we are currently open to the whole world and we can easily get to know even more

288
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
amazing people.

289
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:07,320
It's also, it's really like, it makes things harder because like in the whole world, there

290
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,520
are so many amazing people that you just won't have time to talk to everyone.

291
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,080
But it also makes it easier because like, you know, I'm not trying to intentionally like

292
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:26,760
choose who I will talk to, but if we meet each other, it means that we intended, that

293
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,480
we had to meet each other and we have to have this conversation.

294
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,720
And if we like each other, we'll continue our conversations.

295
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,440
And if not, okay, like a lot of other people are waiting to have this conversation.

296
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,520
So you just have more choices right now.

297
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,360
Yeah, that's very true.

298
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,280
And I mean, I don't shy away from the human topic.

299
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,200
I think that's a very important thing and I do agree with you.

300
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,160
The last two years have been rough.

301
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,960
There's a lot of people that I personally know who's lost, you know, who's lost their

302
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:08,280
jobs and one sometimes thinks that if this happens to people in say the United States,

303
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,160
for example, you know, but it's not that big of a deal that there's a lot of work, they'll

304
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,560
quickly find a job, but it's not always the case.

305
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:25,660
You know, I've known people who a year later after the big lives in 2020, who still hadn't

306
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:34,080
found a job and people who had to settle for jobs that they weren't really happy in because,

307
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,140
you know, it was just the nature of the time.

308
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,480
Things have changed.

309
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,960
Now, I think there's a different challenge now.

310
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:49,440
I spoke to somebody the other day in one of the other podcasts and so I asked him, like,

311
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,640
what does he think is one of the challenges for junior people and early stage developers

312
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,480
getting into the industry and he said the problem right now is the industry is a little

313
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:07,760
weird because of all of these layoffs, the industry has flooded with people with a lot

314
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,020
of experience and people who've held very high roles at big companies.

315
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:22,340
So you as a starting junior engineer, you've now suddenly faced with having to compete

316
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,040
with these people because they're in the pool of people looking for jobs now.

317
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:34,720
So while it's still entirely possible and people shouldn't be despondent and feel that

318
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,680
they just chose the wrong time to get into the tech industry, it is something we do need

319
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,580
to acknowledge that it is tricky, right?

320
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,520
It is not easy right now.

321
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,960
There are all kinds of challenges and this is a new one that's been added to the challenges

322
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:58,600
for early stage engineers and then it's just sad to see so many people having to go through

323
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
these things.

324
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Yes, totally.

325
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:09,440
I want to talk about a topic that's maybe to some extent related and it's brought to

326
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,800
my attention.

327
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,960
One aspect of this is brought to my attention by a tweet on Twitter by Febcat that you shared

328
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,920
and then commented on and the topic was on a conversation that was had about mobilizing

329
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:30,120
communities in a time of crisis and as you've alluded to this before, you are from Kyiv

330
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:39,200
and Ukraine and so you more than a lot of people on this earth knows what a true crisis

331
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,200
is and the devastation of all of that, I cannot even imagine it.

332
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,860
I have so much compassion for everybody there.

333
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:58,080
With that big thing in mind, what guidance do you have for people who feel like their

334
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,840
lives are in crisis?

335
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,080
Trying to make a change, but they're scared of failing.

336
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,120
The first thing you have to do is to meet other people and to connect with other people

337
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,160
because when the war started, when Russia started the war in Ukraine on February 21st,

338
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:21,880
so the first thing I've did with my communities, I kind of closed all these chats because there

339
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,960
were a lot of misleading information, but instead of that, I created one group for people

340
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,520
from all the communities who wanted to connect and help to each other and I was always saying

341
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,360
that during the war, it's been seven months already, seven and a half, Ukraine becomes

342
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:49,760
the biggest community in the world because we are all in the same boat and we are helping

343
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:56,560
each other, so before the war, if you will go to a person in the street and ask for help,

344
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,880
it would be hard to find help, but now people are more open to each other and they're helping

345
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,080
each other, so if you face any crisis, you just, you have to, you know, it takes a lot

346
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:20,040
of courage to open your heart to people because without being vulnerable, you can't connect,

347
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:28,760
so you should allow yourself to be vulnerable and just take other people's vulnerability

348
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,600
and care about it, so basically, you have to trust people, you know, sometimes you have

349
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,760
to trust even those people who you don't know yet, but in the end of the day, you will understand

350
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:49,600
who's friend or who's foe because from my experience, sometimes those people who are

351
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,920
very open, who are very smiley, who are always like encouraging each other and all the stuff,

352
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:04,440
they're not really helping in time of crisis and those people who are not that, let's say,

353
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,720
amazing, they are really helpful when you need them and it's really hard to understand

354
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,800
it before you face the challenge, so also, it is really very good to face some challenges

355
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,840
together because after that, you will understand whether you should continue your journey together

356
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,640
or just to wave goodbye.

357
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,800
Yeah, that's true, so do you think that sometimes crisis brings out the best in people?

358
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:42,560
I will say that sometimes crisis really brings opportunities, but it's very, it's like, it's

359
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:56,320
so hard, depends on what kind of human person is because some people will give up and like

360
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:03,160
just go with the flow, do nothing, and other people will try to find ways to make things

361
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:11,960
better and it's just nature, you know, like in nature, if an animal is weak, most likely

362
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,880
it will die, but if it will fight, it will win, it will continue, it will survive, so

363
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:26,920
you know, humans are still animals, so we need just to fight, we need just to continue

364
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:34,640
our conversations, continue cooperations, and you know, like what the war teaches me

365
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:44,040
that if you are alive, if you are healthy, if your family is safe, like nothing else

366
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:51,160
matters, like you will find a place to live, you will find money, you will find food, you

367
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,800
will find everything, like there is no problems unless you are dead.

368
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:06,960
Yeah, that's very true, I think we often take being alive for granted.

369
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,720
Yes, exactly, we think, we struggle with not having money, we struggle with not riding

370
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:21,400
fancy cars, we struggle with not wearing like new clothes every week, but we just don't

371
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:29,320
care that we are alive, and like what the war showed me that many people are dead and

372
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:37,480
they will never come back, so yeah.

373
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:45,800
So as you've mentioned, so all of this is happening in your life, and you're still doing

374
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,320
all these things, right, you're still recording podcasts, having conversations with people,

375
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:59,120
you're running this two water coolers thing, you're always, whenever I see you on Slack

376
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:07,880
or on Twitter or when I watch the podcast recordings, you're always like such a positive

377
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:18,440
spirit, to put it that way, who are the people, events, books, stories that motivates you,

378
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,800
that makes you be who you are?

379
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:29,400
First of all, it's my family for sure, because you know, with other people, they don't know

380
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,200
real me, and I also have my ups and downs and totally will never see me when I'm down,

381
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,960
but my family sees me, and they help me a lot, they support me a lot, and they are not

382
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,040
always having a good time with me, you know, I'm not an easy person, but at the end of

383
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:52,680
the day, we always talk, we always find ways how to work things out, you know, so I'm like

384
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:59,960
married for 11 years so far, and we've gone through a lot, and we're still together, I

385
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:09,520
have an amazing kid, like 10 years old, and it means a life to me to have my family, and

386
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:18,000
like, beside a family, those people who supported me during my community, all this war journey,

387
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,200
I would say that it's for sure Lisa Barocca, who I work with in the Call to Address community,

388
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,480
it's Ella Andeongue, who I work with in the Call to Control community, it's many people

389
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:39,600
from the CMX community, such as Ill Care, such as Lori Goldman, such as Koresh Ghaffari,

390
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,000
so, there are like tons of super cool people who are helping you, even though you are not

391
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,080
asking them to do it, so I'm so happy that I'm working in this community world, because

392
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,800
it's like, it's not, I don't know even how to explain it, but it's totally different

393
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,760
to all other spheres, because I was working in SEO, in sales, in marketing, there is no

394
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:13,080
such support in any sphere as you receive in the community world, and I'm just amazed

395
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,240
with it, and it also motivates me to do the same, to be the same person, so all these

396
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:27,120
people, when I see the generosity, the openness, their helpfulness, I want to do the same,

397
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,400
so it's like the will of life, you do something good, then somebody else will do something

398
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,360
good for you, and it's just continuation, it's how the energy works, if you do something

399
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,080
bad for people, I don't know whether to call it karma or not, but if you do something bad,

400
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,320
you will definitely receive something bad, and if you do something good, you receive

401
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,960
something good, so why don't we do something good?

402
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,720
Yeah, for sure, when you put it like that, it's like, duh, why would we not do good things?

403
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:07,040
Yeah, no, I totally agree, and I have to say, I've been on part of some of these communities,

404
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,280
Slack channels and things like that, and it is definitely a different world than what

405
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,880
you see on a lot of other places, where there's so much communication and open sharing, and

406
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,200
people are never negative towards each other, people are always encouraging you when you

407
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,240
share content, people are always encouraging, oh, that's really good, and people would look

408
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,680
at your stuff and give you feedback, it's definitely a different thing.

409
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,440
The one thing that I found, though, for those people that I work a lot with, early stage

410
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:48,120
developers, is they're scared of joining communities because maybe they're shy, maybe they're unsure

411
00:32:48,120 --> 00:33:00,640
of themselves still because they're new, so what can a community boulder do to bring those

412
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,040
people in and make them feel safe and make them feel welcome and ensure them that their

413
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,760
voice is welcome and that they are welcome to speak?

414
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,680
First of all, it's a human touch, you know, that's exactly, so I'm working with a community

415
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,560
of tech experts, and we have kind of two community in one, so we have code control community

416
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:28,560
is a community of top senior experts, tech experts, and we have 9am community, the community

417
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:36,120
for every freelancer, but we are only in Europe, because we are building this tool for freelancers,

418
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:44,320
and we are letting in people from Europe to join it, but the main idea is that as a person

419
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:52,760
join, we start communication, we start the onboarding process, and we reach out to this

420
00:33:52,760 --> 00:34:00,800
person and we explain how the community works, and we always say that if they need any help,

421
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:07,160
they can always reach out to us and we are here for them, so they don't have to start

422
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,120
a thread in like crowded channel, they don't have to introduce themselves, they don't have

423
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:21,000
to do nothing, but we encourage them to do it just because, you know, the worst question

424
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,800
is unasked, and the question which didn't, I don't know how to say it in English, sometimes

425
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,120
I miss my words, but the worst question is that you didn't ask, and we are explaining

426
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:42,520
it to people, and they can always reach out to me and Ella, my colleague who I work with,

427
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,720
and we will always help them, they can ask us any stupid question, even if they think

428
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,960
that the question is stupid, they can ask it, we will never tell them that the question

429
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,120
is stupid, but we will help them, that's exactly, you know, when I was studying in the university,

430
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:08,800
we had two different kinds of teachers, like one type is who you ask a question, and those

431
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,160
people make you to feel your stupidity, so they tell like, really, you don't know this?

432
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,220
Why are you still learning here? You have to go away and do some low-paid work or something

433
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:30,920
like that, and other people, they won't do it, they will answer you any question, even

434
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:37,800
if you're asking them what will be 2 plus 2, they will answer you, they will explain

435
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,920
you that it will be 4, and they will explain you that why, so you have to be open and you

436
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:50,560
have to tell people that it's okay to ask, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to like

437
00:35:50,560 --> 00:36:00,320
be not perfect, and it's really a lot, it really depends on a community builder to build

438
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,440
this level of trust, to build this level of vulnerability, to build this level of openness

439
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:15,240
in the community, otherwise, and if the community builder is showing it themselves, other people

440
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:25,040
will also do the same, and if like, yeah, so you show an example, you show people how

441
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,920
to act, and then they do it without you, so then you have this amazing space.

442
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:36,680
Yeah, that's great advice, that's definitely what I'm trying to do as part of the community

443
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,600
that I'm building, I'm definitely trying to encourage people to ask, but I'm also encouraging

444
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:50,840
them to ask in a venue that they feel comfortable in, and then slowly push themselves a little

445
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,720
bit out of their comfort zone, and a little bit more, and a little bit more, until before

446
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,160
you know it, you're welcoming new people, you're the one welcoming the new people, you're

447
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,360
the one saying how can I help, but it starts small, and then you build up over time, and

448
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,840
for other people it's easy, they just have a natural tendency to just join in, they just

449
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:21,120
join a community and start talking, but you shouldn't feel bad if that's not you, we're

450
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:27,080
all unique creatures, and you should play to your strengths, but at the same time, as

451
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:35,160
you said, don't be scared, take a chance, trust other people, trust that people are

452
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:42,240
generally good, and they have your best interests at heart.

453
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,920
Thank you, Yuri, this has been a really good conversation, even though it's been really

454
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:55,720
challenging with technology, but yeah, we made it, and in closing, is there anything

455
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:03,480
that you would like to, just any thoughts, words of wisdom, any inspirational things

456
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,840
that you'd like to leave the community with?

457
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:16,840
I will just share what I'm always doing, there is no overnight success, and if you start

458
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,520
small but constant, at the end of the day, at the end of some time period, you will receive

459
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,920
great results, and that's what really relates to community building, because you won't have

460
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,520
a successful community in one week, even in one month, most likely even in one year, but

461
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:41,400
if you constantly keep doing and doing and doing, keep showing up, keep talking to people,

462
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,760
keep encouraging, keep motivating them, at the end of the day, you will have an amazing

463
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,800
community, so start small, be constant, and you will receive big results.

464
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,880
That's great advice, and I 100% agree with that.

465
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,560
Thank you again, thanks again, Yuri, it was lovely to talk to you, we should do this again

466
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,400
when internet connections and technologies are playing along, I'd love to have a conversation

467
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:14,400
