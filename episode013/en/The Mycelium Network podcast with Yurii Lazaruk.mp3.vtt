Welcome to the Marseillean Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:10.320
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.520
Hey, Yuri.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.120
Thank you for joining me for the podcast.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.120
I'm really excited.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.800
Hey, Shauk.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
Thank you for having me.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.640
I'm happy to be here.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.880
So in the past, I've kind of read out a little bio of people, but I thought that's super

00:25.880 --> 00:28.440
boring and it's been done.

00:28.440 --> 00:34.880
So what I like to do is I like to give you the floor and say, tell us about who you are

00:34.880 --> 00:41.120
and take as much time as you need, go back as far as you need, tell us your story.

00:41.120 --> 00:46.480
So you want to ask me how did my parents born me?

00:46.480 --> 00:50.360
That's maybe a little too far back.

00:50.360 --> 00:59.680
Okay, so I'm a community builder right now and I love it very much, but I trapped, let's

00:59.680 --> 01:07.280
say trapped into the community world very, like I didn't think that I will be a community

01:07.280 --> 01:10.480
builder because I was doing a lot of stuff.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.440
I was a risk analyst in the bank.

01:13.440 --> 01:22.200
I was running my internet shop and then somehow, just because of this internet shop, I've made

01:22.200 --> 01:28.600
some SEO for it and I hired people to do it and they did a bad job.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.520
So I decided to learn SEO.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.200
So I went to an SEO forum, started learning.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.760
That's how I understood that they were doing not a good job.

01:40.760 --> 01:45.760
And while learning SEO, I started talking to people, connecting to them.

01:45.760 --> 01:51.920
And one day I saw a message that it will be a meetup somewhere in other city.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.760
And then I was like, okay, why don't we have an SEO meetup in Kiev?

01:56.760 --> 02:03.460
So I just created a post and basically that's how my first community SEO club started.

02:03.460 --> 02:09.520
And we just connected, we just had a conversation, we just had some pizza and we liked it so

02:09.520 --> 02:17.920
much that during the time, some time, it became an SEO club, the best well-known community

02:17.920 --> 02:20.200
of SEO experts in Ukraine.

02:20.200 --> 02:30.480
So after that was like a marketing club, CPC Real Talk is a community for advertisers who

02:30.480 --> 02:32.420
work with paid advertisement.

02:32.420 --> 02:38.420
And also I'm running a sales hero community in Ukraine, it's for salespeople for sure.

02:38.420 --> 02:45.560
And when the war started in Ukraine on 24th of February, basically I've lost my any sources

02:45.560 --> 02:50.560
of income because it was dependent on community, I made it some courses and all this stuff.

02:50.560 --> 02:57.000
But for sure, people didn't need to learn and all this, they needed to understand how

02:57.000 --> 02:58.840
to survive.

02:58.840 --> 03:04.720
And at that point, I just reached out to David Spinks, the founder of the CMX community and

03:04.720 --> 03:10.680
told him that, hey, David, I have this experience and I'm in trouble, I need some community

03:10.680 --> 03:13.800
job, I need something to do.

03:13.800 --> 03:18.080
And he told me, yeah, okay, I will help you, he made a post.

03:18.080 --> 03:22.840
That's how I found, that's how I met Steve Gargiulo from the cultivators community, we're

03:22.840 --> 03:25.040
still working with them.

03:25.040 --> 03:30.200
And that's how I started doing an audit for a CMX community.

03:30.200 --> 03:34.600
So it helped me a lot to support me and my family during the hard times.

03:34.600 --> 03:39.040
And that's how I basically become an international community, not only builder, but a consultant

03:39.040 --> 03:40.040
too.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.240
So it was really very fast.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.080
So I was building my communities, Ukrainian communities for seven years.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.560
Five of those years, I didn't even know that it called community building.

03:49.560 --> 03:54.340
I thought that I just meet great people and we have some good time.

03:54.340 --> 04:00.760
And then I joined the CMX community, I understood that I'm not alone in this community world.

04:00.760 --> 04:07.200
And yeah, basically, that's how I started being a community, international community

04:07.200 --> 04:08.200
person.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.200
Great.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.520
That's a really good story.

04:11.520 --> 04:16.040
I'm glad that you had people to reach out to and that people helped you.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.560
So I'm really grateful for that.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.720
But you know, also it was not in a second.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.840
So I was kind of building these connections.

04:24.840 --> 04:29.720
So I joined CMX community like two years before and I was there.

04:29.720 --> 04:34.400
I was communicating with people, but I just never get to know other people very good.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.760
But at least they knew me.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.680
So I was not like a person from the street.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.120
Yeah, I get that.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.120
Cool.

04:44.120 --> 04:50.640
So do you want to talk a little bit about the Community Life podcast?

04:50.640 --> 04:53.120
Seeing that you're on a podcast.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.520
Yes, yes, yes.

04:54.520 --> 05:01.440
It was it was my idea I started in the sales hero community.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.480
So what was the idea behind it?

05:03.480 --> 05:08.640
I just choose great people, great experts from the sales world.

05:08.640 --> 05:13.920
And we go with them and we have just this conversation about themselves.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.560
So it's not about titles.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.640
It's not about some tricks.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.380
It's just about people.

05:19.380 --> 05:23.400
So I'm really curious, who are their parents?

05:23.400 --> 05:25.280
Like where did they born?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.440
How their childhood looked like?

05:27.440 --> 05:29.760
And all this stuff.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.000
Like I just I'm just curious.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.880
I just want to know these people better.

05:34.880 --> 05:39.640
And we are having this conversation.

05:39.640 --> 05:44.080
We can understand how to be a successful salesperson here.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.040
Like what skills do you need?

05:46.040 --> 05:48.280
Who are those people who are great?

05:48.280 --> 05:55.560
And like when I become, let's say, international expert, I decided, OK, so why don't we have

05:55.560 --> 05:58.320
this conversation with community experts?

05:58.320 --> 06:02.320
And I just once again, I just reached out to David Spinks with this crazy idea.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.080
Tell them, hey, David, I have this idea.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.080
Why don't we try?

06:06.080 --> 06:08.320
And he was like, sure, I've never done this before.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.520
Let's do it.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.760
So it was my first, let's say, episode.

06:12.760 --> 06:18.580
And by now, I had a conversation with 18 amazing people so far.

06:18.580 --> 06:22.560
And I keep going, you know, just one new conversation every week.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.520
So it helps me a lot.

06:25.520 --> 06:30.880
Like as I told, I'm really curious about people and it helps me very much to understand those

06:30.880 --> 06:35.040
people who I am talking to in the community world.

06:35.040 --> 06:40.680
And I really do not hunt an audience.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.000
I don't know how many people listen to those podcasts.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.040
But once again, the main idea is that at the moment, there are just two people, me and

06:49.040 --> 06:52.600
the guest, we are talking about their lives.

06:52.600 --> 06:59.200
And it's just very, you know, it's just very emotionally connected experience.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.680
And I just love it.

07:00.680 --> 07:06.120
So and also people who listened to podcasts, they told me that they love it, too.

07:06.120 --> 07:09.080
So you know, click, match.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.080
Let's do it.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.080
Yeah, exactly.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.760
That's exactly how I feel about this experience.

07:14.760 --> 07:20.640
I mean, this I've recorded probably about 15 now we've released 12.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.920
But it's also the conversations are just it's just wonderful.

07:23.920 --> 07:30.560
I get to speak to really different people from all walks of life from different places

07:30.560 --> 07:35.300
in the world and get to hear their stories and what makes them excited and the struggles

07:35.300 --> 07:36.300
they have.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.080
And that leads you to start thinking like, how can I help?

07:39.080 --> 07:42.520
Like, what can I do to help these people?

07:42.520 --> 07:49.320
Sometimes you also connect over similar challenges, like maybe like I'm from a third world country.

07:49.320 --> 07:53.240
So if I speak to somebody else's also in a developing country, oftentimes they tell me

07:53.240 --> 07:58.520
a story and I'm like, oh, my goodness, I can so relate because I've also experienced this.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.520
But I've had some some luck.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.360
Maybe some of it I created for myself, some of it just came across my path.

08:04.360 --> 08:09.680
And through that, I'm able to use my connections to help these people.

08:09.680 --> 08:14.400
And so, yeah, I I'm also like, I don't know how many I've some rough ideas how many people

08:14.400 --> 08:15.400
listen to the show.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.960
But that's not the most important thing to me.

08:17.960 --> 08:21.960
To me, it's more like if somebody like my daughter, for example, she told me the other

08:21.960 --> 08:25.720
day she started listening to the podcast and she can't stop.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.520
And I was like, that's lovely.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.520
I love that.

08:28.520 --> 08:35.000
I love that somebody that's like an author, who's a little curious about coding and stuff

08:35.000 --> 08:39.600
like that, but who likes stories, enjoy the podcast, because that's what I want it to

08:39.600 --> 08:40.600
be.

08:40.600 --> 08:44.760
It's about people telling stories about their life and about what they what's hard and what's

08:44.760 --> 08:46.760
what's not.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.840
People love to talk.

08:47.840 --> 08:53.840
And if you if you are asking them about themselves, they will really share.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.520
So they will share everything you will ask you.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.720
You have to just ask it.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.040
Yeah, yeah, that's very true.

09:01.040 --> 09:06.440
And I've also found that you shouldn't be scared to reach out to people.

09:06.440 --> 09:12.480
I think it's it's amazing how many people are willing to to talk to you.

09:12.480 --> 09:18.600
So what I was what I was going to say is we had this conversation scheduled for a little

09:18.600 --> 09:20.080
earlier than we're doing it now.

09:20.080 --> 09:24.560
And it's because you said you had this between two water coolers meeting.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.440
And I was like, that sounds interesting.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.880
I've heard about between two ferns.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.560
What is this between two water coolers thing?

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
Yeah.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.320
So it's it's a super fast.

09:36.320 --> 09:41.160
Yeah, it was I was motivated by between two ferns.

09:41.160 --> 09:47.400
So I decided I even have this picture of Zach Galifianakis staying between two ferns.

09:47.400 --> 09:54.880
And there are a lot of there are photos from our every meeting behind him like on the wall.

09:54.880 --> 09:59.200
So this is a picture for between two water coolers meeting.

09:59.200 --> 10:05.980
And what is the idea that you go there?

10:05.980 --> 10:14.320
We collect some community experts and we just have three rounds of five minutes of communication.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.280
So we just go to one on one breakout rooms.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.360
We meet each other.

10:18.360 --> 10:22.760
We talk about everything we want for five minutes, three times.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.280
And we have just really quick and fun experience.

10:26.280 --> 10:32.320
It allows us to build these connections to get to know each other a little better.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.440
And also, there is no obligations.

10:34.440 --> 10:37.500
You don't have to talk for half an hour or an hour.

10:37.500 --> 10:41.400
So if you clicked, you can continue your conversation in the community world.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.640
You can even go for a Zoom call.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.380
You can even meet in person.

10:45.380 --> 10:49.080
If you don't click, once again, no expectations.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.040
Just go to another person.

10:51.040 --> 11:00.720
So it's kind of, let's say, networking, speed networking or speed dating networking, something

11:00.720 --> 11:01.720
like that.

11:01.720 --> 11:05.920
But once again, the main idea is that it's super cool, super fast, super fun.

11:05.920 --> 11:12.240
And just 20 minutes a week, you don't have to spend a lot of time to meet amazing people.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.360
And once again, it's all about connections.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.760
It's all about meeting new people.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.760
But just another way of doing it.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
Yeah.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.680
And is this open to anybody?

11:20.680 --> 11:24.360
How do you go about joining it?

11:24.360 --> 11:25.360
Totally open to everyone.

11:25.360 --> 11:30.880
I just hosted in the CMX community because I love CMX community and it helped me a lot

11:30.880 --> 11:35.480
during my life and during all this war stuff.

11:35.480 --> 11:42.280
And it's kind of my, let's say, I want to give back something.

11:42.280 --> 11:49.280
That's why I'm hosting these events in the CMX community every week, every Friday.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.540
So I just love it and people love it.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.880
So once again, one more click, one more match.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.760
Yeah, that's great.

11:57.760 --> 12:02.880
I started using this app that's still in very early development called Groove.

12:02.880 --> 12:07.700
And the idea there is that it's also people from all over the world.

12:07.700 --> 12:12.560
Currently, it's on your phone, but they think they're looking at making a desktop version

12:12.560 --> 12:14.280
of it as well.

12:14.280 --> 12:18.920
And so you'd say, I want to start a groove and then it would notify some people.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.740
And then they can decide to join the groove.

12:21.740 --> 12:25.760
And then everybody gets on camera and you say like, what do you want to try and do in

12:25.760 --> 12:27.760
the next 50 minutes?

12:27.760 --> 12:29.280
And then you say, OK, let's do it.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.800
And then everybody goes away and have a little chat window open.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.880
And then people do their jobs and they like try to tickle stuff if they get it done.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.980
And then after 50 minutes, everybody comes back together and you basically give a status

12:40.980 --> 12:45.520
update of what you were able to do in the 50 minutes.

12:45.520 --> 12:54.280
And yeah, if you work remotely and you work in, I don't know, you just feel sometimes

12:54.280 --> 13:00.280
you feel a little lost, a little alone, maybe like you need that human connection.

13:00.280 --> 13:06.360
And I love all these opportunities that are starting to happen on the Internet for people

13:06.360 --> 13:10.360
to connect in all kinds of different ways.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.840
In preparation for this, I kind of looked at your Twitter and your LinkedIn and stuff

13:14.840 --> 13:19.500
like that to kind of learn more about who you are.

13:19.500 --> 13:27.320
And so one of the things that I've realized is that you're somebody who loves people and

13:27.320 --> 13:33.840
who have a generally very positive attitude towards life.

13:33.840 --> 13:41.400
And I won't say I will definitely not say that I dislike people, but sometimes but sometimes

13:41.400 --> 13:49.840
I get down about what we do to each other and and our planet and things like that.

13:49.840 --> 14:01.800
So I read a tweet where the question was, if you weren't scared of failure, what would

14:01.800 --> 14:03.400
you do?

14:03.400 --> 14:10.160
And you replied to that exactly what I was doing now, just without fear.

14:10.160 --> 14:14.960
And so that suggests to me that fear is not something that stops you.

14:14.960 --> 14:22.560
So how did you get to this place where you can be okay with the fear?

14:22.560 --> 14:31.800
You know, you never can be okay with the fear, because it's something that lives with us,

14:31.800 --> 14:37.200
but you have you can have different response, you can, you know, you can fight or flight.

14:37.200 --> 14:45.680
So here is the same, like I can, like, froze and stay and be afraid of everything and not

14:45.680 --> 14:52.700
do nothing, or the fear is motivating me, you know, when if I'm afraid of something,

14:52.700 --> 14:55.300
it means that I'm going out of my comfort zone.

14:55.300 --> 15:02.560
And most likely, if I didn't receive results, I wanted most likely I need to go out of my

15:02.560 --> 15:04.880
comfort zone and try something new.

15:04.880 --> 15:12.800
So that's how I learned not to be afraid of doing something new of trying of making mistakes

15:12.800 --> 15:20.080
and what like, what we really fear, what we're really afraid of is to make mistakes.

15:20.080 --> 15:27.520
And even more what other people will will think about us, if we will make those mistakes.

15:27.520 --> 15:33.040
But you know, it's like it's natural for people to make mistakes.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.800
And it's not a mistake.

15:34.800 --> 15:41.360
It's the way we learn, because, you know, when children starts start going, they're

15:41.360 --> 15:46.440
falling so many times, but they continue trying to walk.

15:46.440 --> 15:50.360
And then they're walking without even thinking about it.

15:50.360 --> 15:55.320
So why are we afraid to try to walk?

15:55.320 --> 16:00.800
We need to try, we need to try, we need to fall many times, we need to hurt our legs,

16:00.800 --> 16:07.320
we need maybe even to hurt our head sometime, like not literally, but in general.

16:07.320 --> 16:13.880
But that's the only way like, you know, some people say that you can learn by seeing and

16:13.880 --> 16:17.240
reading about others mistakes.

16:17.240 --> 16:21.580
But no, the best way to learn is to make your own mistakes.

16:21.580 --> 16:28.120
And I love this saying from the line chocolate advertisement, that if you will forgive my

16:28.120 --> 16:31.240
imperfection, I'll forgive yours.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.740
So basically, that's how I feel.

16:33.740 --> 16:38.680
And if I'm making mistakes, if somebody will point that I'm making a mistake without saying

16:38.680 --> 16:43.120
how to make it better, I will just not care about it.

16:43.120 --> 16:50.160
So if somebody will say that I made a mistake and help me to not to make this mistake in

16:50.160 --> 16:52.160
the future, I will really appreciate it.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.760
And that's how we'll build our connections.

16:54.760 --> 16:59.360
And that's how we become friends, you know, otherwise, like, why care?

16:59.360 --> 17:06.320
I mean, that leads into another one that where you said that it is 100% okay to say I don't

17:06.320 --> 17:08.400
know.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.160
And I agree with that.

17:11.160 --> 17:15.300
I don't allow myself that often.

17:15.300 --> 17:20.720
But when I catch myself in those moments, I'm like, hey, whoa, stop.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.800
It's okay to say you don't know.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.860
It's actually it means that this is a learning opportunity, right?

17:26.860 --> 17:31.020
If it's something you don't know, well, are you interested in knowing this thing?

17:31.020 --> 17:38.880
And if so, wow, we're in the age where content is, there's too much, you actually, we're

17:38.880 --> 17:40.520
drowning in information.

17:40.520 --> 17:43.600
So if you don't know, you can learn.

17:43.600 --> 17:49.440
Yes, it, it saves a lot of time, because you can talk to a person.

17:49.440 --> 17:54.560
And the person will say some words, some, I don't know, meanings or something that you

17:54.560 --> 17:55.740
don't know.

17:55.740 --> 18:00.080
And you can say that, oh, I'm sorry, but can you explain me this?

18:00.080 --> 18:01.080
I just don't know.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.920
I just don't understand.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.960
And person will explain you this in two minutes.

18:05.960 --> 18:11.880
And you will save a lot of time because you don't have to try things out and you will

18:11.880 --> 18:13.920
understand each other.

18:13.920 --> 18:19.440
And there will be no, you know, this going back and forth, trying to understand what

18:19.440 --> 18:24.560
that person really mean, because you will understand it right away and it will save

18:24.560 --> 18:27.560
a lot of time and nerves and sometimes even money.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.420
Yeah, very true.

18:30.420 --> 18:37.600
So I know that you're mostly focused on like community building and in sales and that kind

18:37.600 --> 18:38.600
of thing.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.160
But I think technology is part of all of our lives.

18:40.160 --> 18:46.320
I mean, we're using it right now to be able to have this conversation.

18:46.320 --> 18:52.760
So I'm curious, do you have any thoughts about the tech industry?

18:52.760 --> 18:56.120
Just like a high level, like somebody from the outside, like if you're looking at the

18:56.120 --> 19:01.760
tech industry from the outside, why do you think about this industry, like the good and

19:01.760 --> 19:02.760
the bad?

19:02.760 --> 19:11.400
It's a really big question because what I recently saw, like from community side of

19:11.400 --> 19:15.240
tech industry, it's many layoffs and all this stuff.

19:15.240 --> 19:20.360
So I'm like thinking from this point, from human point of view, and I don't really like

19:20.360 --> 19:26.600
it right now because many amazing people lost their jobs and all this, and all they're going

19:26.600 --> 19:30.000
through these difficult challenges, et cetera.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.200
But in general, if we're not talking about the human side, if we're talking about technologies,

19:35.200 --> 19:40.360
it's definitely amazing that we even have, you know, I'm in one place of the world, you

19:40.360 --> 19:42.680
and another, and we still have this conversation.

19:42.680 --> 19:50.320
So it allows us to connect, like not taking in the mind the whole distance between us

19:50.320 --> 19:58.680
so, like we are currently open to the whole world and we can easily get to know even more

19:58.680 --> 20:00.280
amazing people.

20:00.280 --> 20:07.320
It's also, it's really like, it makes things harder because like in the whole world, there

20:07.320 --> 20:11.520
are so many amazing people that you just won't have time to talk to everyone.

20:11.520 --> 20:17.080
But it also makes it easier because like, you know, I'm not trying to intentionally like

20:17.080 --> 20:26.760
choose who I will talk to, but if we meet each other, it means that we intended, that

20:26.760 --> 20:30.480
we had to meet each other and we have to have this conversation.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.720
And if we like each other, we'll continue our conversations.

20:33.720 --> 20:40.440
And if not, okay, like a lot of other people are waiting to have this conversation.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.520
So you just have more choices right now.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.360
Yeah, that's very true.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.280
And I mean, I don't shy away from the human topic.

20:48.280 --> 20:53.200
I think that's a very important thing and I do agree with you.

20:53.200 --> 20:56.160
The last two years have been rough.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.960
There's a lot of people that I personally know who's lost, you know, who's lost their

20:59.960 --> 21:08.280
jobs and one sometimes thinks that if this happens to people in say the United States,

21:08.280 --> 21:14.160
for example, you know, but it's not that big of a deal that there's a lot of work, they'll

21:14.160 --> 21:18.560
quickly find a job, but it's not always the case.

21:18.560 --> 21:25.660
You know, I've known people who a year later after the big lives in 2020, who still hadn't

21:25.660 --> 21:34.080
found a job and people who had to settle for jobs that they weren't really happy in because,

21:34.080 --> 21:37.140
you know, it was just the nature of the time.

21:37.140 --> 21:38.480
Things have changed.

21:38.480 --> 21:41.960
Now, I think there's a different challenge now.

21:41.960 --> 21:49.440
I spoke to somebody the other day in one of the other podcasts and so I asked him, like,

21:49.440 --> 21:53.640
what does he think is one of the challenges for junior people and early stage developers

21:53.640 --> 21:59.480
getting into the industry and he said the problem right now is the industry is a little

21:59.480 --> 22:07.760
weird because of all of these layoffs, the industry has flooded with people with a lot

22:07.760 --> 22:15.020
of experience and people who've held very high roles at big companies.

22:15.020 --> 22:22.340
So you as a starting junior engineer, you've now suddenly faced with having to compete

22:22.340 --> 22:27.040
with these people because they're in the pool of people looking for jobs now.

22:27.040 --> 22:34.720
So while it's still entirely possible and people shouldn't be despondent and feel that

22:34.720 --> 22:39.680
they just chose the wrong time to get into the tech industry, it is something we do need

22:39.680 --> 22:42.580
to acknowledge that it is tricky, right?

22:42.580 --> 22:44.520
It is not easy right now.

22:44.520 --> 22:49.960
There are all kinds of challenges and this is a new one that's been added to the challenges

22:49.960 --> 22:58.600
for early stage engineers and then it's just sad to see so many people having to go through

22:58.600 --> 22:59.600
these things.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.600
Yes, totally.

23:00.600 --> 23:09.440
I want to talk about a topic that's maybe to some extent related and it's brought to

23:09.440 --> 23:10.800
my attention.

23:10.800 --> 23:16.960
One aspect of this is brought to my attention by a tweet on Twitter by Febcat that you shared

23:16.960 --> 23:22.920
and then commented on and the topic was on a conversation that was had about mobilizing

23:22.920 --> 23:30.120
communities in a time of crisis and as you've alluded to this before, you are from Kyiv

23:30.120 --> 23:39.200
and Ukraine and so you more than a lot of people on this earth knows what a true crisis

23:39.200 --> 23:45.200
is and the devastation of all of that, I cannot even imagine it.

23:45.200 --> 23:51.860
I have so much compassion for everybody there.

23:51.860 --> 23:58.080
With that big thing in mind, what guidance do you have for people who feel like their

23:58.080 --> 23:59.840
lives are in crisis?

23:59.840 --> 24:03.080
Trying to make a change, but they're scared of failing.

24:03.080 --> 24:08.120
The first thing you have to do is to meet other people and to connect with other people

24:08.120 --> 24:13.160
because when the war started, when Russia started the war in Ukraine on February 21st,

24:13.160 --> 24:21.880
so the first thing I've did with my communities, I kind of closed all these chats because there

24:21.880 --> 24:27.960
were a lot of misleading information, but instead of that, I created one group for people

24:27.960 --> 24:35.520
from all the communities who wanted to connect and help to each other and I was always saying

24:35.520 --> 24:42.360
that during the war, it's been seven months already, seven and a half, Ukraine becomes

24:42.360 --> 24:49.760
the biggest community in the world because we are all in the same boat and we are helping

24:49.760 --> 24:56.560
each other, so before the war, if you will go to a person in the street and ask for help,

24:56.560 --> 25:01.880
it would be hard to find help, but now people are more open to each other and they're helping

25:01.880 --> 25:08.080
each other, so if you face any crisis, you just, you have to, you know, it takes a lot

25:08.080 --> 25:20.040
of courage to open your heart to people because without being vulnerable, you can't connect,

25:20.040 --> 25:28.760
so you should allow yourself to be vulnerable and just take other people's vulnerability

25:28.760 --> 25:36.600
and care about it, so basically, you have to trust people, you know, sometimes you have

25:36.600 --> 25:42.760
to trust even those people who you don't know yet, but in the end of the day, you will understand

25:42.760 --> 25:49.600
who's friend or who's foe because from my experience, sometimes those people who are

25:49.600 --> 25:56.920
very open, who are very smiley, who are always like encouraging each other and all the stuff,

25:56.920 --> 26:04.440
they're not really helping in time of crisis and those people who are not that, let's say,

26:04.440 --> 26:10.720
amazing, they are really helpful when you need them and it's really hard to understand

26:10.720 --> 26:18.800
it before you face the challenge, so also, it is really very good to face some challenges

26:18.800 --> 26:24.840
together because after that, you will understand whether you should continue your journey together

26:24.840 --> 26:26.640
or just to wave goodbye.

26:26.640 --> 26:32.800
Yeah, that's true, so do you think that sometimes crisis brings out the best in people?

26:32.800 --> 26:42.560
I will say that sometimes crisis really brings opportunities, but it's very, it's like, it's

26:42.560 --> 26:56.320
so hard, depends on what kind of human person is because some people will give up and like

26:56.320 --> 27:03.160
just go with the flow, do nothing, and other people will try to find ways to make things

27:03.160 --> 27:11.960
better and it's just nature, you know, like in nature, if an animal is weak, most likely

27:11.960 --> 27:17.880
it will die, but if it will fight, it will win, it will continue, it will survive, so

27:17.880 --> 27:26.920
you know, humans are still animals, so we need just to fight, we need just to continue

27:26.920 --> 27:34.640
our conversations, continue cooperations, and you know, like what the war teaches me

27:34.640 --> 27:44.040
that if you are alive, if you are healthy, if your family is safe, like nothing else

27:44.040 --> 27:51.160
matters, like you will find a place to live, you will find money, you will find food, you

27:51.160 --> 27:56.800
will find everything, like there is no problems unless you are dead.

27:56.800 --> 28:06.960
Yeah, that's very true, I think we often take being alive for granted.

28:06.960 --> 28:13.720
Yes, exactly, we think, we struggle with not having money, we struggle with not riding

28:13.720 --> 28:21.400
fancy cars, we struggle with not wearing like new clothes every week, but we just don't

28:21.400 --> 28:29.320
care that we are alive, and like what the war showed me that many people are dead and

28:29.320 --> 28:37.480
they will never come back, so yeah.

28:37.480 --> 28:45.800
So as you've mentioned, so all of this is happening in your life, and you're still doing

28:45.800 --> 28:51.320
all these things, right, you're still recording podcasts, having conversations with people,

28:51.320 --> 28:59.120
you're running this two water coolers thing, you're always, whenever I see you on Slack

28:59.120 --> 29:07.880
or on Twitter or when I watch the podcast recordings, you're always like such a positive

29:07.880 --> 29:18.440
spirit, to put it that way, who are the people, events, books, stories that motivates you,

29:18.440 --> 29:21.800
that makes you be who you are?

29:21.800 --> 29:29.400
First of all, it's my family for sure, because you know, with other people, they don't know

29:29.400 --> 29:35.200
real me, and I also have my ups and downs and totally will never see me when I'm down,

29:35.200 --> 29:40.960
but my family sees me, and they help me a lot, they support me a lot, and they are not

29:40.960 --> 29:46.040
always having a good time with me, you know, I'm not an easy person, but at the end of

29:46.040 --> 29:52.680
the day, we always talk, we always find ways how to work things out, you know, so I'm like

29:52.680 --> 29:59.960
married for 11 years so far, and we've gone through a lot, and we're still together, I

29:59.960 --> 30:09.520
have an amazing kid, like 10 years old, and it means a life to me to have my family, and

30:09.520 --> 30:18.000
like, beside a family, those people who supported me during my community, all this war journey,

30:18.000 --> 30:25.200
I would say that it's for sure Lisa Barocca, who I work with in the Call to Address community,

30:25.200 --> 30:31.480
it's Ella Andeongue, who I work with in the Call to Control community, it's many people

30:31.480 --> 30:39.600
from the CMX community, such as Ill Care, such as Lori Goldman, such as Koresh Ghaffari,

30:39.600 --> 30:46.000
so, there are like tons of super cool people who are helping you, even though you are not

30:46.000 --> 30:54.080
asking them to do it, so I'm so happy that I'm working in this community world, because

30:54.080 --> 31:00.800
it's like, it's not, I don't know even how to explain it, but it's totally different

31:00.800 --> 31:06.760
to all other spheres, because I was working in SEO, in sales, in marketing, there is no

31:06.760 --> 31:13.080
such support in any sphere as you receive in the community world, and I'm just amazed

31:13.080 --> 31:19.240
with it, and it also motivates me to do the same, to be the same person, so all these

31:19.240 --> 31:27.120
people, when I see the generosity, the openness, their helpfulness, I want to do the same,

31:27.120 --> 31:34.400
so it's like the will of life, you do something good, then somebody else will do something

31:34.400 --> 31:40.360
good for you, and it's just continuation, it's how the energy works, if you do something

31:40.360 --> 31:45.080
bad for people, I don't know whether to call it karma or not, but if you do something bad,

31:45.080 --> 31:48.320
you will definitely receive something bad, and if you do something good, you receive

31:48.320 --> 31:50.960
something good, so why don't we do something good?

31:50.960 --> 31:58.720
Yeah, for sure, when you put it like that, it's like, duh, why would we not do good things?

31:58.720 --> 32:07.040
Yeah, no, I totally agree, and I have to say, I've been on part of some of these communities,

32:07.040 --> 32:10.280
Slack channels and things like that, and it is definitely a different world than what

32:10.280 --> 32:16.880
you see on a lot of other places, where there's so much communication and open sharing, and

32:16.880 --> 32:23.200
people are never negative towards each other, people are always encouraging you when you

32:23.200 --> 32:27.240
share content, people are always encouraging, oh, that's really good, and people would look

32:27.240 --> 32:31.680
at your stuff and give you feedback, it's definitely a different thing.

32:31.680 --> 32:37.440
The one thing that I found, though, for those people that I work a lot with, early stage

32:37.440 --> 32:48.120
developers, is they're scared of joining communities because maybe they're shy, maybe they're unsure

32:48.120 --> 33:00.640
of themselves still because they're new, so what can a community boulder do to bring those

33:00.640 --> 33:07.040
people in and make them feel safe and make them feel welcome and ensure them that their

33:07.040 --> 33:11.760
voice is welcome and that they are welcome to speak?

33:11.760 --> 33:16.680
First of all, it's a human touch, you know, that's exactly, so I'm working with a community

33:16.680 --> 33:22.560
of tech experts, and we have kind of two community in one, so we have code control community

33:22.560 --> 33:28.560
is a community of top senior experts, tech experts, and we have 9am community, the community

33:28.560 --> 33:36.120
for every freelancer, but we are only in Europe, because we are building this tool for freelancers,

33:36.120 --> 33:44.320
and we are letting in people from Europe to join it, but the main idea is that as a person

33:44.320 --> 33:52.760
join, we start communication, we start the onboarding process, and we reach out to this

33:52.760 --> 34:00.800
person and we explain how the community works, and we always say that if they need any help,

34:00.800 --> 34:07.160
they can always reach out to us and we are here for them, so they don't have to start

34:07.160 --> 34:13.120
a thread in like crowded channel, they don't have to introduce themselves, they don't have

34:13.120 --> 34:21.000
to do nothing, but we encourage them to do it just because, you know, the worst question

34:21.000 --> 34:29.800
is unasked, and the question which didn't, I don't know how to say it in English, sometimes

34:29.800 --> 34:36.120
I miss my words, but the worst question is that you didn't ask, and we are explaining

34:36.120 --> 34:42.520
it to people, and they can always reach out to me and Ella, my colleague who I work with,

34:42.520 --> 34:47.720
and we will always help them, they can ask us any stupid question, even if they think

34:47.720 --> 34:51.960
that the question is stupid, they can ask it, we will never tell them that the question

34:51.960 --> 34:58.120
is stupid, but we will help them, that's exactly, you know, when I was studying in the university,

34:58.120 --> 35:08.800
we had two different kinds of teachers, like one type is who you ask a question, and those

35:08.800 --> 35:16.160
people make you to feel your stupidity, so they tell like, really, you don't know this?

35:16.160 --> 35:22.220
Why are you still learning here? You have to go away and do some low-paid work or something

35:22.220 --> 35:30.920
like that, and other people, they won't do it, they will answer you any question, even

35:30.920 --> 35:37.800
if you're asking them what will be 2 plus 2, they will answer you, they will explain

35:37.800 --> 35:42.920
you that it will be 4, and they will explain you that why, so you have to be open and you

35:42.920 --> 35:50.560
have to tell people that it's okay to ask, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to like

35:50.560 --> 36:00.320
be not perfect, and it's really a lot, it really depends on a community builder to build

36:00.320 --> 36:06.440
this level of trust, to build this level of vulnerability, to build this level of openness

36:06.440 --> 36:15.240
in the community, otherwise, and if the community builder is showing it themselves, other people

36:15.240 --> 36:25.040
will also do the same, and if like, yeah, so you show an example, you show people how

36:25.040 --> 36:30.920
to act, and then they do it without you, so then you have this amazing space.

36:30.920 --> 36:36.680
Yeah, that's great advice, that's definitely what I'm trying to do as part of the community

36:36.680 --> 36:43.600
that I'm building, I'm definitely trying to encourage people to ask, but I'm also encouraging

36:43.600 --> 36:50.840
them to ask in a venue that they feel comfortable in, and then slowly push themselves a little

36:50.840 --> 36:56.720
bit out of their comfort zone, and a little bit more, and a little bit more, until before

36:56.720 --> 37:03.160
you know it, you're welcoming new people, you're the one welcoming the new people, you're

37:03.160 --> 37:09.360
the one saying how can I help, but it starts small, and then you build up over time, and

37:09.360 --> 37:14.840
for other people it's easy, they just have a natural tendency to just join in, they just

37:14.840 --> 37:21.120
join a community and start talking, but you shouldn't feel bad if that's not you, we're

37:21.120 --> 37:27.080
all unique creatures, and you should play to your strengths, but at the same time, as

37:27.080 --> 37:35.160
you said, don't be scared, take a chance, trust other people, trust that people are

37:35.160 --> 37:42.240
generally good, and they have your best interests at heart.

37:42.240 --> 37:45.920
Thank you, Yuri, this has been a really good conversation, even though it's been really

37:45.920 --> 37:55.720
challenging with technology, but yeah, we made it, and in closing, is there anything

37:55.720 --> 38:03.480
that you would like to, just any thoughts, words of wisdom, any inspirational things

38:03.480 --> 38:06.840
that you'd like to leave the community with?

38:06.840 --> 38:16.840
I will just share what I'm always doing, there is no overnight success, and if you start

38:16.840 --> 38:21.520
small but constant, at the end of the day, at the end of some time period, you will receive

38:21.520 --> 38:28.920
great results, and that's what really relates to community building, because you won't have

38:28.920 --> 38:34.520
a successful community in one week, even in one month, most likely even in one year, but

38:34.520 --> 38:41.400
if you constantly keep doing and doing and doing, keep showing up, keep talking to people,

38:41.400 --> 38:45.760
keep encouraging, keep motivating them, at the end of the day, you will have an amazing

38:45.760 --> 38:50.800
community, so start small, be constant, and you will receive big results.

38:50.800 --> 38:55.880
That's great advice, and I 100% agree with that.

38:55.880 --> 39:01.560
Thank you again, thanks again, Yuri, it was lovely to talk to you, we should do this again

39:01.560 --> 39:07.400
when internet connections and technologies are playing along, I'd love to have a conversation

39:07.400 --> 39:14.400
with you again, all of the very best, thanks for everything you're doing, and stay safe.

39:14.400 --> 39:20.080
Thank you very much, Auk, it's an amazing talk, and I'm happy that we met, so yeah,

39:20.080 --> 39:21.080
