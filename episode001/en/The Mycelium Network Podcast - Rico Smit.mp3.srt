Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast. A podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,760
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way. Today we are going to have a chat with

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,880
Riku Smed. He is some of the people that joined the Mycelium Network very early on and has been

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,680
pretty active on the community. So I thought it only appropriate to have him as one of the first

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:32,320
guests. Hey Riku, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. So I've seen some

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,720
of these questions to you before and just so you can be a little bit more prepared but we'll

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,160
off the cuff some things here and there. No pressure, it's just an informal chat to just

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,120
learn what works, what doesn't work, what's the challenges you're facing and how the mentors that

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:55,120
I speak with can potentially help. So to get us off to a start, tell us a bit about your background.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,200
What did you do up to now and what made you look into getting into software or web development

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,280
specifically? Well, since I was born and raised here in Pretoria, my uncle has been very heavy

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,280
into technology. So ever since I was little, I remember standing by him, seeing what he's doing

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,960
and that intrigued me from a young age. And then throughout high school, I had the opportunity to

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,800
take IT and actually discover the love for coding and I had a chance to get all of the fundamentals

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:38,000
down. But as soon as that all ended, I had to basically walk out into a job. I worked in

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,360
retail for a hardware shop. I did what I had to to survive, but it's not what I want to do. I always

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,200
had this feeling like I want to do something else. The first course I had with you actually,

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,880
I actually realized how much I love web development above stuff like app development or

19
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,120
server working or security stuff like that. I actually realized I really love working with all

20
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,640
that. I actually realized I really love working with web, creating pages, designing new things.

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I just fall in love with it. That's great. So yeah, I'm looking to study now. At the end of the day,

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,120
I would like to be a full stack developer, being able to do everything and anything that is

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,360
necessary. That's good too. I think it's good to have that as a goal. But what I do find is like

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:42,320
they talk about being T-shaped in terms of your skills. So you have a broad knowledge base,

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,320
but then you have something that you focus in. For myself personally, I do know about back end

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,440
development and I've done stuff and I keep doing stuff in that region like Python a little bit.

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,560
And even databases still like the old relational kind of stuff. I say old, but people definitely

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,440
still use traditional databases today. But I definitely have the T of my T-shape is definitely

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,800
focused on front end development and like, as they say, front of the front. So I like the design

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,760
aspects and I like the CSS and making things look good and work well and performance accessibility.

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,800
Those things are really important to me. So I think it's good to have that broader perspective

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,000
of what happens in the industry, but it's always nice to have something that's more your focus area.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,440
You really go deep as they say. So you have this breadth and then you have depth in a certain area.

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:42,240
But that's great. Yeah. I know for myself also, I also got into web development from

35
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,560
a music background. For me, the nice thing about web in the early days with Flash and that was

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,000
still around was that it had this thing where I could take the musical aspect and the design

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,120
aspect and take a little bit of programming and mix them all in. Because we used to make these

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,520
Flash intros, which are like little movies that used to play before you'd actually go into the

39
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,440
website. We had a little movie with text and animation and whatnot, and then it would say,

40
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,240
click to enter. That used to be a huge thing back in the day. So I understand starting something

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,600
and then being bitten by this web thing and really digging into it. So is there something you wanted

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,080
to expand on? I must say I'm more interested in the front end side of things. It feels like I

43
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,560
would like to know the back end part to make things simpler if you do get stuck. But I must

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,120
definitely say I'm more interested in front end development. I don't really find PHP interesting.

45
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,440
I hate SQL. We had to do some in high school. I absolutely hate it. Yeah. No, it's a journey.

46
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,040
It is for sure. So now we know you about your background and how you came to where you are

47
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
and what you're looking to do for your future. Like you mentioned, one of the main things you

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,280
need to do is learn. So as you're learning, which resources have you really come to depend on?

49
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,920
I've got three, actually four now. I really like the input I usually get from you.

50
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,120
If we get together, I have a chat about things that's going on and places to find things to

51
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,840
help the development further. VS Code has gotten very essential for me. It is, I try it, sublime

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,640
text. It is very bare-boned and feels like amazing if you have a laptop and traveling around

53
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,640
and you have a moment to quickly open up and edit something. It's also very, very,

54
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,120
it's a lot smaller than VS Code. So it's easier for me to carry around on a flash drive.

55
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,520
So having Git actually is amazing. Just using GitHub in general, because where I am,

56
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,160
I would be able to download my current project. I'd be able to open it in sublime and work on it.

57
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,080
But when I'm home, I prefer to use GitHub to download my updates and everything

58
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,280
and then work through VS Code. And funny enough, YouTube is very essential to me.

59
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,960
I struggle to sit and read through a document of pages and pages. I just can't. So for me,

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,480
I like YouTube, someone telling you do this, this and this, and then they type it out.

61
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,040
So you can actually pause and go and do it yourself and then rinse and repeat until you

62
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,400
get the hang of whatever you're doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I agree. There's

63
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,440
definitely different modalities that work better for some people. That is why with the 150 days

64
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,280
of HTML thingy that I'm putting together, I have incorporated video into the pages now so that if

65
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,360
you're more of a video person, you can listen to me talk through the content, but you have the

66
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,520
content just below you as a reference. I think that for me is something that I have understood

67
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,960
more and more is giving people different ways to consume the same content because not everybody

68
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,960
learns the same way. Is there anybody specifically on YouTube that you want to give a shout out to

69
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,920
that you find is particularly good? Now you're asking me a question half. I do know his name.

70
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:24,320
I just want to retrieve it. If I remember correctly, it's Mosh and he has a lot of coding

71
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:31,200
tutorials online. His entire teaching style, the way he talks, explains, all of the little

72
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,840
graphs and things he uses is amazing. I just really like learning this from this guy in particular.

73
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,320
I'm trying to just get his name right now. If I remember correctly, it's Mosh.

74
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,760
Sounds familiar. I think you've mentioned him to me as well.

75
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,000
The one big problem I'm actually running into as a new developer is finding the information I need.

76
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,040
Yeah. Yeah. So more often than not, I'd find myself asking what's next. I don't know what to learn

77
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,400
from here on out. Unfortunately, I do rely on free resources at the moment

78
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,360
because currently it's running from paycheck to paycheck. So I simply do not have the means to

79
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,440
pay for courses quite yet, especially the online stuff gets really expensive really quickly.

80
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,840
Yes, that's true.

81
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,040
There we go. I found his name, Mosh Hamadani.

82
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,560
All right. Cool. We should link him up in the

83
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,840
send me the link afterwards and I'll put it in the show notes. And I'll probably reach out to him

84
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,520
and see if I can do an interview with him on the podcast. Yeah, no, all of those things are very

85
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,880
true. And I think what's kind of nice is something that's starting to get a little more traction is

86
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,640
the idea of purchasing power parity pricing. It's always a hard one to say with the idea being that

87
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,480
depending on where you live, they will geofence the content, but you will pay a smaller and lower

88
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,680
amount based on where you live. Somebody that's really great with this is somebody like Ken C.

89
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,560
Dodds. He's got all those courses about react and testing and all that kind of stuff. And if I,

90
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,280
living in South Africa, purchase one of these courses, I get a 60% discount on that. So that's

91
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,080
like a purchase is one of these courses. I get a 60% discount immediately just because of purchase

92
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,080
parity pricing. So I think that's something that the industry as a whole should consider more

93
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,760
widely because then they can make it because I understand why people ask money for courses.

94
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,040
It's a heck of a lot of work. And if you want to do it well, it's especially a lot of work. And

95
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:57,760
for some people, this is how they make a living. But it is tough when you come from a third world

96
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,240
country or you're just starting out and you're still finding your feet and you don't have a bunch

97
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,360
of money to invest yet. It is hard. There's all kinds of other interesting things developing

98
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,480
around that idea as well. There's some academies and stuff in the United States exploring a different

99
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,600
way of paying for your courses. But that is definitely, I think the thing that I get from you is that

100
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,840
one big thing that's missing is a roadmap that you can look at, which points you at specific

101
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:33,040
learning material based on where you are along your path and also which path you're on. Are you

102
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,240
on a backend path? Are you on a full stack path or you're more on a front end path? Because you'll

103
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,240
have different milestones and different learning material needs there. So I think that is something

104
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,880
that we should look into, see if there are some resources to help there. Yeah, no, definitely.

105
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,040
Because being in the front end developer, I've been working, learning, and then I reach a point

106
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:05,840
and I just look at everything online. What now? Do I just invest my time into CSS? Do I just continue

107
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:12,240
HTML, Java? What next? What do I need to do? What do I need to find? So I end up spending two to three

108
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,360
hours searching for stuff to learn, running out of steam, learning for an hour or two, and then

109
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,320
continuing with my day. Rather than having to go somewhere and spend those hours more, an hour

110
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,520
finding this and this and this is what I need. And then two to three hours of learning whatever

111
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:38,720
needs to come next. Yeah. I think communities such as the Mycelium Network can also help there,

112
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,600
especially if we can get some more mentors to join our Discord server. And then where we're

113
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,440
talking about the idea of having some meetups virtually and in person where possible. I think

114
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,600
that'll help because there you can pose these kinds of questions and talk with other people.

115
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,160
And often, more often than not, somebody else is being where you are and they can say,

116
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,640
oh, I actually found this thing and it can kind of help you on your way. So I think

117
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,120
investing in community and joining in on these communities and being active I think is one of

118
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,840
the ways we can start solving this roadmap problem. But we have to get people from

119
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,880
data learning and people who are teaching in the same place. A nice mix of two. So you don't have

120
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,080
too many mentors and too little. So yeah, definitely. And it's quite a shy guy. It's

121
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,920
very difficult for me to enter the community. I don't know why I've always had this thing about

122
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,960
online communities. Even during my leisurely hours when I have gaming and stuff, I would not

123
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,280
communicate with both people on the server. I just find it strange, you can say. So that was quite

124
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:59,040
different for me. But what I found is you just jump in, find one thing you like, just drop a

125
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,640
comment and see what happens. Because after that first comment, you find it's actually not that

126
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:11,120
intimidating or scary. You can just go. Yeah, that's very true. And a lot of that comes down

127
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:19,520
to also the people running the community. If you are focused and you start off with good

128
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,200
community guidelines and you clearly enforce them, it helps a lot. Because there are

129
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:34,240
bundles out there that just want to come and sour the pot. But as long as there's people that

130
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,800
have their finger on the pulse and can quickly pick that up and make sure that those people are

131
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,880
either kicked or reprimanded in a way that they understand that that kind of behavior is not

132
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,040
welcome and their continued participation is going to hinge very heavily on them changing their

133
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,880
attitude. I think that is important. And it's something that unfortunately has been a little

134
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,680
rough on the internet, to put it mildly. Places got very toxic very quickly. And for me and you,

135
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,160
it might be a little bit easier than for some genders and people of different races and

136
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,160
ethnicities. For them, it's even harder to really feel comfortable in these groups. So big challenges

137
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,160
that we have, but as long as we acknowledge them, then at least we're in the right direction.

138
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,520
I think you've touched on a lot of the stuff from the next question I had in mind,

139
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,480
but I'm going to pose it anyway, just in case there's anything else. So having talked about

140
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,280
all of these resources and stuff. So clearly there's a bunch of things that don't work,

141
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,600
but there are things that work. But if there's anything else that you feel on that doesn't work

142
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,440
so great side that you want to highlight. The work that not works so great is a bit difficult.

143
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:56,320
It does not work so great. The only thing I'm personally really stuck on is feeling lost.

144
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,280
You're this drop that falls into an ocean, just kind of told swim. You don't know where you're

145
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,440
going. You don't know which way. You don't know if you should swim down or up or what's going on.

146
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,800
That's the only thing that's really missing for me. But that said, I do have you as a mentor as well.

147
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,320
So I don't feel that lost. If I get stuck, you can meet up and just say,

148
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,200
hey, listen, this is going on. How can we resolve this?

149
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,160
How can we resolve this? That's the important thing to have

150
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,080
and to nurture is this whole mental relationship. Because I do think that there's a lot of value

151
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,600
there that I think a lot of people miss. Yeah, that's what I'm about to say. That's

152
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,400
definitely something that's missing is finding someone you can ask a question to.

153
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,880
To just ask, how do you had a heading in HTML? And not him having you laugh at you and just saying,

154
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,400
oh, okay, let's help you. This is how we do it. This is why we do it. But I did not feel that

155
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,440
personally, because I did start my journey with you. So I had that from the get go, but I can

156
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,360
really see that being missing in a lot of people's startup, you can often have same.

157
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:17,040
Yeah, for sure. That's true. I've been there also. And I know that I actually searched widely to try

158
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,840
and find, is there any networks or mentorship programs or anything like that, that you can join?

159
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,400
And there are some now, to be honest, that I should probably mention. I'll put some of the

160
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,280
links to some of them in the show notes. Some stuff like Outreachy is really, really great.

161
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:43,360
And they also focus on being very intrusive. Outreachy does some amazing work. And there are

162
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,920
some other mentorship programs as well. But unfortunately, some of the mentorship things

163
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,640
again, comes with a cost, which is understandable. But again, if you're not in a position to be able

164
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,400
to pay, it is just another roadblock you have to face. And even though, you know, it's not

165
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,640
easy, even though web development specifically, that's what I can talk to mostly, I've come a

166
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,000
heck of a long way since the day was when I started. And a lot of things that used to be

167
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,880
super hard are now trivially simple. It's still not easy. There's still a lot of questions that

168
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,320
one has. So, you know, the need for that still exists very much.

169
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:33,760
No, it definitely does. As for the roadblock of the payment is, I have looked into teaching myself,

170
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:44,240
IT in general. So startup courses for old people or women, especially in my area, don't really know

171
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,600
how computers work. That was a big thing for me. A lot of female older women don't know in the area.

172
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,320
So I was looking to make something for them to teach them how computers work. And I completely

173
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:03,040
understand why you charge so much for a course. It's a lot of hard work. It's a lot of information

174
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,240
gathering and this and that. And you need to remember this. And even once I was ready to

175
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,880
start, I still felt like I still have to go through a couple of things and make sure.

176
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,640
I can totally understand why, but not having the funds necessarily available to

177
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,760
you by let's say $60 for advanced courses will help you. It's quite a hindrance because now I

178
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:35,600
have to go search. How can I get this information for free? Yeah. No, for sure. I completely get

179
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,200
that. And the other thing with courses, of course, is that you have to, especially if you're asking

180
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,360
money, is you have to keep it up to date. It's not something you make and then forget about because

181
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:56,000
the tech industry evolves and moves quite fast. So that's the other part is if you want to keep it,

182
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,600
if you want it to be useful, you have to keep it up to date.

183
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,880
That is something as well, because I was following books from Microsoft. I was lucky enough to get

184
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,920
access to those books and they fell into that trap. I would learn and learn and learn and learn it

185
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,000
to some point and I'll hit a roadblock. It's been, what's this? It's not working. What's going on?

186
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,960
And I have to go search for hours and hours and hours just to find out this phrase is no longer

187
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:34,400
valid. Simply change X to Y and it works. Yeah. So that is definitely a pitfall. I can see some

188
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,040
people falling into not keeping everything up to date. And it is frustrating for us who's new at

189
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:47,200
learning these things because now where you would know this or know where to look for it, I need to

190
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,320
spend two or three hours trying to find out why it's not working. What's going on? What's this error?

191
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,960
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But teeing off the thing where you said you were looking at creating some

192
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,000
courses to teach people other skills that you already have, I think in general, that is a good

193
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,600
idea. And that's something that a lot of people knew to development. This doesn't matter what

194
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,440
industry it is, are a little bit scared of, but that I would personally encourage is to write about

195
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:23,120
the stuff that you learn because teaching is one of the best ways of learning. So if you've

196
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:30,560
built something, anything, like write about how you made it. It doesn't necessarily have to tell

197
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,960
a story per se about the struggles you had. It can literally just be you writing down how to make a

198
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,880
responsive euro with HTML and CSS. Because by doing that, you are thinking through the process

199
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
of having done that. Oftentimes you find ways that you can do it even better than what you've

200
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,480
already done it. So you automatically improve your existing code base. And at the end of the day,

201
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,920
you have a piece of writing that can also be useful for whether you start a business or whether

202
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,480
you're looking for employment. You have something to point people to, to say, not only did I make

203
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,000
this thing, but I wrote about how I did it. Because there's not a lot of people that can do

204
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,840
both of those things. A lot of people are really good at writing the software, but they're not so

205
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,640
great at teaching it. And more often than not, it's not that they don't have the skills. They

206
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,240
just never exercise that skill. So as they exercise their coding skills, they don't exercise

207
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,520
writing about their coding. And so that kind of never develops. So you have this amazing

208
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,400
software engineer, but if he tries to explain something to you, it's like right over your head,

209
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,280
because they'd never go back and think about how did I, what did I do before I knew how to do this?

210
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:46,480
How did I get to that point? What was the things that I, what were the things I did wrong? And how

211
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,920
did I find a better way and stuff like that. So I think while you're learning writing about the stuff

212
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:59,280
that you make is incredibly important. You just gave me a great idea to maybe branch off of my

213
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:08,640
existing URL to start something to score RWS journey. Just a place we can write. I made a

214
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,040
navigation bar today by using this, this, and this. I hit this roadblock, but I found this information

215
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,640
there. So if someone does read it, they can say, that's my problem. So I can just go look over there

216
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,400
to go fix it. Because something I hit a hard roadblock with is including JSON. So I can just

217
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,400
add JSON into my project. So everyone was just like, no, just add it, just install it, just do it.

218
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,120
Like, yeah, how, how do I do this? And after like two or three hours, I was like, oh, I just make a

219
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,040
text file, change the name and paste the stuff in and include it into my job and bam, Bob's your uncle.

220
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,360
Then again, just that little bit of knowledge I couldn't find for about two to three hours,

221
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,960
because everyone just explains how to use it, not how to implement it. Gotcha. And it's literally

222
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,360
because people just don't think that far back anymore. For them using JSON is just a thing you

223
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,120
do. Like it's just text. What are you talking about? But it's like, no, but if you don't know,

224
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,600
if you don't know what JSON is and how it fits into the larger framework of building a,

225
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,880
let's take for example, the one tool that I built developer tool chest. All that is in the end of

226
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,880
the day is a website that loads some JSON that has a specific structure and it loops through them.

227
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,880
And for each entry, it makes little block based on the search filter that you typed in. But if you

228
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,240
don't know how JSON fits into that whole thing, it can be like, wait, what is this JSON now? Is it a

229
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,200
database? It's like kind of, not really. So it's understanding that no, JSON is just a flight text

230
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:02,400
file that has certain limitations placed upon it. And JSON in the end is data. So this is like the

231
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,560
data part of your project. You describe data inside your JSON document and then you can consume

232
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,560
it as if it's like a database, kind of. Just a very, very loose database. I don't know if you've

233
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:23,840
ever looked up SQLite, but if you haven't, it doesn't matter. Just maybe after the podcast,

234
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,960
just have a search for SQLite. And SQLite is essentially just a flat text file on your hard

235
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:37,760
drive that acts as a database. But you can query the data as if it's SQL. That's why SQLite. And

236
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,800
like it's in everything. It's in everything. Like your mobile phone, your everything. It's

237
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:49,840
everywhere. SQLite is like everywhere. Okay. I already opened a tab of VF after we're done. So

238
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,600
that's one of those great reads. And that also reminded me, that's something I see a lot of

239
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,840
mentors fall, I want to say fall short, but I don't know if that's the right word. That's why

240
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:09,520
I like following Mosh. He says, use an H1 tag to add a title. And a lot of people just move on.

241
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,560
But for me personally, I want to know why. What does it do? How does it work? And what he does

242
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,600
is he pulls up the graph and tells you, H1 does this. It adds a title. It does this. This is how

243
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,040
you use it. This is how you can use it. So that is something I've been struggling with as well.

244
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
Because I've been following someone doing a text adventure game, because that was interesting to

245
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,040
me. This guy would just type, no, use this, this, this, enter, and go to the next thing. I'm like,

246
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,280
wait, why? Why did you do this? How does this work? You didn't explain to me anything. You just wrote

247
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,240
code on a little pad and moved on. So you didn't actually teach me anything. You just showed me

248
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:57,040
what you can do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess there's a place for that. But I think more often

249
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,280
than not, you find that a lot on Twitch, like a lot of people on Twitch would stream them working.

250
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,520
And the idea is not to, you might pick up some stuff by watching, but that's not their intent.

251
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,200
Their intent is just like, I'm doing some stuff and maybe I want to be held accountable. And

252
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,760
therefore I will stream every day between five and seven, and I'll work on this specific project.

253
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,200
It's more a way of keeping themselves accountable. And if somebody learned something out of it,

254
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,640
then great, but that's not the intent. But yeah, that's, that's all good stuff. So I'm wondering,

255
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,800
so looking towards the future, Sam, I'm going to, I'm going to, it was two separate questions,

256
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:42,240
but I think I'm going to throw it into one question. Okay. So you can do one or two things.

257
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,160
Like you can learn and learn and learn and eventually apply for a job and work for somebody

258
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,520
else. Or you can do the other thing, which is create your own opportunity by starting your own

259
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,600
business, whether that is building a product or starting an agency where you create websites and

260
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,920
design for other people. But I think in both of those areas, it doesn't really matter which one

261
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:13,360
you choose. This idea of an interview is part of both. The difference being on the one hand,

262
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,320
you're interviewing for a specific position at a specific company. The other one you're being

263
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,000
interviewed by a client who wants to know that if I give you money, I'll get a website and return.

264
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,800
So therefore I need to, you know, I'm just not blindly going to give you money. I want to speak

265
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,880
to you a little bit. And it's also a kind of an interview. So my question is, which one of the two

266
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:42,000
is of most interest to you, like starting a business or working for somebody. And based on

267
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,920
that, what is the things about these interviews that perhaps scare you a little bit? Okay.

268
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,800
Personally, I'd like to start my own business. I walked out of high school into my permanent job

269
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,640
working for about three years as a retail salesperson. And after that, I got the

270
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,840
opportunity for better hours, more pay doing school photos. So I've been working for a while

271
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,720
now. So I've been working there for three years now as well. So I've been basically working

272
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,920
since I got out of high school and I've reached a point where I've had enough of making someone

273
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,240
else rich. I've got a lot of knowledge. I've got a lot of experience with a lot of things.

274
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,640
I do feel like I want to start my own thing and I want to get away from working for someone else.

275
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,480
I want to start my own business. I'm starting my own thing, which I already have started.

276
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,280
I'm still looking for clients now. I've got one client pending. We still need to do this

277
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:46,640
interview you're talking about. But having about three years worth of sales experience,

278
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,240
the interviews are a fun part for me. I look forward to it and it's exciting.

279
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,840
I can definitely see the scary bits of it, having to explain to someone why to use you.

280
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,560
But what I always found in sales is if you use the term faker to make it, you can sell a pen

281
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:12,960
to a pen factory. If you stand there with a smile and they ask you, can you do back-end

282
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,840
developments and do this whole database thing? And tell them, yeah, sure. I do have to do some

283
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,600
research. I do need to freshen up on a couple of things, but let's talk. Let's see what you can do.

284
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,760
And I'll tell you yes or no, I can or cannot assist you. Then a client's more likely to use you,

285
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,120
if you're honest about things like that. Because they don't feel you're trying to

286
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,560
scam them out of money. They do feel like, okay, yeah, I do know what I'm doing. I just need to

287
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,560
sharpen up. So then already feel like, oh, okay. So you're not just someone looking for a quick

288
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,760
buck. You're actually interested in the work. Yeah, honesty goes a long way in business.

289
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,120
That's for sure. And I mean, I say that knowing full well that the business industry can be a

290
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,960
bit of a cutthroat industry as well. But I think you have to have morals for yourself and for your

291
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,760
business. And like me personally, for me as well, I have very fine lines of the type of clients I'd

292
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,920
be willing to work with and ones I wouldn't be willing to work with. And I think there I

293
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,520
shield myself a little bit from this cutthroat, like it's all about the money kind of thing.

294
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,240
Yeah, I think it's great. I think it's great to be honest and open that, sure, I can do this.

295
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,920
This specific part of the project might be a little bit more challenging, but

296
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,560
you know, I have enough experience in how to find answers. That's what I do is I find solutions to

297
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:41,760
problem. The technology is almost kind of the easy part. Mentally finding a solution is

298
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,680
lots of times harder than actually writing the code. It's understanding what is the problem

299
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,880
that the client's facing. How do I best solve this? And then what technology do I need to employ in

300
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,320
order to solve this? Because oftentimes people will come to you with a preconceived idea in their

301
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,040
head, because they've heard it from a friend, but it might not necessarily be the best solution for

302
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,240
them. There might be something better that's come along since they've framed it their thing.

303
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,080
Their friend might actually also benefit from your services. And because they might not know

304
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,000
that there's a better way to do this now, that could actually save them money or, you know,

305
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
help them grow their business faster. I'm always excited when I hear people wanting to start their

306
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,800
own businesses, because if we look at unemployment in the world, the need for jobs is massive. And

307
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:39,360
it is for each of us that starts our own little business and start networking with each other.

308
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,680
We're creating opportunities for ourselves, but down the line, we're creating opportunities for

309
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:50,400
others. And the nice thing about somebody like yourself, for example, sorting a business is,

310
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,240
you know, the pain of having to learn this stuff and having to find a job where people say,

311
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,400
oh, how much experience do you have? While working experience, not yet, but I've done all these.

312
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,880
Oh, no, no, no, we're looking for something five years experience, sorry. So you'll be more open

313
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,720
to listening to somebody and giving them a chance and telling them, you know what, come work. I'll

314
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,760
pay you a full salary for a month and let's see how it goes. If by the end of the month,

315
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:25,200
I can see that you could do the job, well, let's just keep going. But if I find that after a month

316
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,120
that you can even struggle, but if you're willing to learn and you're willing to do what's necessary

317
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,120
to get the work done, I'm happy to employ you. I think the more that we can get that kind of

318
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,000
thing going, the better. Yeah. And that sense that is something I find very difficult. I've been on

319
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,520
a lot of platforms like Upwork and so on, looking for jobs and I find stuff and I look at them like,

320
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,440
I can do this. I can do everything you need. I have all the requirements. I've got the technology.

321
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,840
I've got the background. I've got an internet connection. I've got all of this. The only thing

322
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,440
I'm lacking is the three years of experience I must have you're looking for. Yeah. And finding

323
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,160
that one person that says, Hey, listen, this is your opportunity. Just try, let's see what you can

324
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:18,800
do. That's all you need. That's all you need. That one guy that just says, I'm willing to give you

325
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,800
a month's worth of work. Let's see what you're doing. How are you doing? How are you handling

326
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,640
this? On a little bit of a side tangent, the interview, just circling back to the interviews,

327
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:37,760
I do have some advice for people. I turn it around. If I have a client comes to me, they can just find

328
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,480
my wording. I am interviewing them. I get them to tell me what they need. I get to tell them what

329
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,600
they get them to tell me what they are looking for, what they are looking to do. So they'll come to

330
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,000
me on three pages. I want this done. I want that done. I want this there. They'll be like, okay,

331
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,360
they'll be like, okay, well, this I can do for you. This I can do for you. It's very difficult. It

332
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,640
takes long. So you are going to be charged more for this because instead of just a quick, quick

333
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,520
hours with the work, this can take me about three or four hours, but I can do it another way for you.

334
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,840
So instead of sitting there and wondering, like, I'm, I'm being interviewed. I turn it around.

335
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:21,360
I ask them, what are you looking for? What do you want? What do you want out of this website?

336
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,880
Because obviously I can say whatever I want. And I might just go off in a site engine for an hour,

337
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,160
just speaking about myself and what I did, not answering any questions. Where if I tell the

338
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:38,480
client, what's your question? Then I answer, what's your next question? And I answer. And you ask a

339
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,120
question, I say something like, wait a second, this is not how it works. We can't do it this way.

340
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,920
We can do it this way, this way, or this way. Clients love having options. Yeah. So it's,

341
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:55,520
you pretty much flipped the interview around and you're interviewing them now. Because at the end

342
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,520
of the day, you do need to know from them what you need to do. Oh, yes. And having that person just

343
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,240
ask you the entire time, what do you want? What are you looking for? Yes, I can do this for you.

344
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,680
No, I cannot do this for you. Feels a lot easier than I sell websites. I make websites, go look

345
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,480
over there. I can make a navigation bar. I can. Then you change it all from me, me, me to them.

346
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:27,360
And you change the focus point around on them. And I feel very special if I can state it like that.

347
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,000
Yeah, no, for sure. No, that's great advice. Yeah. Thanks for sharing that.

348
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,720
This was really cool. I really enjoyed this. I'm looking forward to seeing where you go and

349
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,960
what you do with your business. So before we officially wrap it up, is there any projects

350
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,120
you're currently working on that you like to tell everybody about? This can be open source,

351
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,560
can be side projects, doesn't matter, client projects that you can talk about, or any like

352
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,160
links that you'd like people to know about. And of course, we'll have them all also in the

353
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,560
show notes. But if you want to give some specific shout outs, then go for it.

354
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,840
Not quite at the moment. I do have a client outstanding that is going, everything points

355
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,040
are going to use me to create their website. They do work with aluminum and door frames and

356
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:28,080
they install them for different houses all around our area here in Pretoria. So I will

357
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,720
love to share that journey. Like you said, I would love to make a blog for a journey

358
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,520
of how I will create that. But as of now, I still need all the information. So I haven't started

359
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,600
yet, but I have started planning. I have started looking at designs and color schemes and stuff

360
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:54,080
like that. The only current project I do have is my own website, which is rwswebdesign.co.za.

361
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,240
It is currently live. I have been communicating with our community, improving some stuff,

362
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,160
changing grammar, updating some of my graphics. And I do keep it up to date because this will be

363
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:16,160
my private business website from year on. That's great. Can you just repeat that URL for us?

364
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:25,520
That's rwswebdesign.co.za. Okay. rwswebdesign.co.za. Go check it out, folks.

365
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,960
So other than that, the side projects I don't really have at the moment,

366
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,120
I would like to give a shout out to FreeCodeCamp.org. You actually gave me this site a bit

367
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:44,720
earlier this week, I think. It's an amazing platform so far for me to learn. They do start

368
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,000
from the very basics, which is a bit annoying. They got about four or five exercises in, and

369
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,840
they've already taught me something new of the basics. I didn't know. So far, it feels like an

370
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:02,080
amazing tutorial, especially for beginners to start at because they start simple, easy to understand.

371
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,200
They've got documentation, all of that good things.

372
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,680
Yeah. And the great thing about FreeCodeCamp is, well, it's free, but

373
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,320
beyond that, it's built by a community of contributors. So one, it's kept up to date,

374
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,960
constantly being improved. And you yourself, like Riku, that's learning, you can contribute back to

375
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,680
that project, even if it's just a small thing where you maybe find the wording of something not

376
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,880
as understandable as you'd like to be. It's an open source project. You can fork it, open a pull

377
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,120
request and propose something that you feel would improve it. So I think it's really great to be

378
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,640
involved with projects like that. And as one of the other ones that I'll give a shout out to,

379
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,280
because I'm quite involved with them, that is in the same vein. It's an open source project. All

380
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,760
the content is right there. It's community written. There are some people paid to work on it, but it's

381
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,920
a massive open source project. So I think being involved in these projects is great. And there's

382
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,760
a lot of wonderful people behind these projects that would be happy to receive pull requests. So

383
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,320
I can personally send an invitation to everybody listening to both go check out FreeCodeCamp and

384
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,800
MDN Web Docs on GitHub and on the web and learn, contribute. It's all good. It's all learning

385
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,840
experience. So yeah, thanks for sharing that. Yeah. So yeah, no, there is something I would like to

386
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:36,080
go back and actually donate to FreeCodeCamp, not if, when my business takes off. When I become

387
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,480
a success, I would love to go back and actually donate to them. And that is something I am very

388
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:48,320
appreciative of them. They don't cap their learning based on paygates. You are busy working and it

389
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,200
pops up like, Hey, listen, would you like to donate? I just look ashamed. Like, no, not now.

390
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,880
Maybe, maybe once my first site takes off and I've made my first sale, I'll come back and I'll

391
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,800
come donate something. I've totally done that. I've totally done that with a couple of open

392
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,960
source things where it's been just like, I wouldn't be where I am without it. And so now

393
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,240
that I am where I am, I totally just go and do a monthly, like set up a monthly donation

394
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,360
because I want it to be around for the next generation and I want it to keep improving.

395
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,080
So yeah, I think that's great that you're also already preparing yourself for doing that.

396
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,120
It's great stuff. Well, thanks Rico. It was really great. Thanks for being the first guest

397
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,640
on the My CD and Metro podcast. I hope this is going to be one of many, many, many, and

398
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,440
we'll do one again once, once your business is huge and you've got like hundreds of employees.

399
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,440
That's been great. Thank you for having me. It's been quite an experience. Always nice to

400
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,680
sit and speak to someone about these kinds of things. Yeah. Not just sitting in your own mind,

401
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,440
just thinking about all of this stuff and just feeling stuck. So I would actually recommend it

402
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,440
for shy people as well. Get a community, join a community and just start speaking with people.

403
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,480
It really lightens the load if you say it like that. Yeah, it's been quite a pleasure.

404
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,880
Same for me. Thank you for listening to this episode of the My CD and Metro podcast.
