Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast. A podcast all about early stage web developers

00:05.600 --> 00:11.760
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way. Today we are going to have a chat with

00:11.760 --> 00:16.880
Riku Smed. He is some of the people that joined the Mycelium Network very early on and has been

00:16.880 --> 00:21.680
pretty active on the community. So I thought it only appropriate to have him as one of the first

00:21.680 --> 00:32.320
guests. Hey Riku, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure. So I've seen some

00:32.320 --> 00:36.720
of these questions to you before and just so you can be a little bit more prepared but we'll

00:36.720 --> 00:42.160
off the cuff some things here and there. No pressure, it's just an informal chat to just

00:42.160 --> 00:47.120
learn what works, what doesn't work, what's the challenges you're facing and how the mentors that

00:47.120 --> 00:55.120
I speak with can potentially help. So to get us off to a start, tell us a bit about your background.

00:55.680 --> 01:01.200
What did you do up to now and what made you look into getting into software or web development

01:01.200 --> 01:09.280
specifically? Well, since I was born and raised here in Pretoria, my uncle has been very heavy

01:09.280 --> 01:15.280
into technology. So ever since I was little, I remember standing by him, seeing what he's doing

01:15.280 --> 01:20.960
and that intrigued me from a young age. And then throughout high school, I had the opportunity to

01:20.960 --> 01:28.800
take IT and actually discover the love for coding and I had a chance to get all of the fundamentals

01:28.800 --> 01:38.000
down. But as soon as that all ended, I had to basically walk out into a job. I worked in

01:38.000 --> 01:47.360
retail for a hardware shop. I did what I had to to survive, but it's not what I want to do. I always

01:47.360 --> 01:53.200
had this feeling like I want to do something else. The first course I had with you actually,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.880
I actually realized how much I love web development above stuff like app development or

01:59.680 --> 02:05.120
server working or security stuff like that. I actually realized I really love working with all

02:05.120 --> 02:12.640
that. I actually realized I really love working with web, creating pages, designing new things.

02:12.640 --> 02:21.440
I just fall in love with it. That's great. So yeah, I'm looking to study now. At the end of the day,

02:21.440 --> 02:25.120
I would like to be a full stack developer, being able to do everything and anything that is

02:25.120 --> 02:33.360
necessary. That's good too. I think it's good to have that as a goal. But what I do find is like

02:33.360 --> 02:42.320
they talk about being T-shaped in terms of your skills. So you have a broad knowledge base,

02:42.320 --> 02:48.320
but then you have something that you focus in. For myself personally, I do know about back end

02:48.320 --> 02:53.440
development and I've done stuff and I keep doing stuff in that region like Python a little bit.

02:53.440 --> 02:58.560
And even databases still like the old relational kind of stuff. I say old, but people definitely

02:58.560 --> 03:05.440
still use traditional databases today. But I definitely have the T of my T-shape is definitely

03:05.440 --> 03:10.800
focused on front end development and like, as they say, front of the front. So I like the design

03:10.800 --> 03:17.760
aspects and I like the CSS and making things look good and work well and performance accessibility.

03:17.760 --> 03:22.800
Those things are really important to me. So I think it's good to have that broader perspective

03:22.800 --> 03:30.000
of what happens in the industry, but it's always nice to have something that's more your focus area.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.440
You really go deep as they say. So you have this breadth and then you have depth in a certain area.

03:35.440 --> 03:42.240
But that's great. Yeah. I know for myself also, I also got into web development from

03:42.240 --> 03:46.560
a music background. For me, the nice thing about web in the early days with Flash and that was

03:46.560 --> 03:52.000
still around was that it had this thing where I could take the musical aspect and the design

03:52.000 --> 03:57.120
aspect and take a little bit of programming and mix them all in. Because we used to make these

03:57.120 --> 04:01.520
Flash intros, which are like little movies that used to play before you'd actually go into the

04:01.520 --> 04:07.440
website. We had a little movie with text and animation and whatnot, and then it would say,

04:07.440 --> 04:14.240
click to enter. That used to be a huge thing back in the day. So I understand starting something

04:14.240 --> 04:21.600
and then being bitten by this web thing and really digging into it. So is there something you wanted

04:21.600 --> 04:28.080
to expand on? I must say I'm more interested in the front end side of things. It feels like I

04:28.080 --> 04:34.560
would like to know the back end part to make things simpler if you do get stuck. But I must

04:34.560 --> 04:39.120
definitely say I'm more interested in front end development. I don't really find PHP interesting.

04:39.920 --> 04:47.440
I hate SQL. We had to do some in high school. I absolutely hate it. Yeah. No, it's a journey.

04:47.440 --> 04:55.040
It is for sure. So now we know you about your background and how you came to where you are

04:55.040 --> 04:58.880
and what you're looking to do for your future. Like you mentioned, one of the main things you

04:58.880 --> 05:07.280
need to do is learn. So as you're learning, which resources have you really come to depend on?

05:09.600 --> 05:15.920
I've got three, actually four now. I really like the input I usually get from you.

05:15.920 --> 05:21.120
If we get together, I have a chat about things that's going on and places to find things to

05:21.840 --> 05:29.840
help the development further. VS Code has gotten very essential for me. It is, I try it, sublime

05:29.840 --> 05:36.640
text. It is very bare-boned and feels like amazing if you have a laptop and traveling around

05:37.440 --> 05:42.640
and you have a moment to quickly open up and edit something. It's also very, very,

05:42.640 --> 05:47.120
it's a lot smaller than VS Code. So it's easier for me to carry around on a flash drive.

05:48.640 --> 05:55.520
So having Git actually is amazing. Just using GitHub in general, because where I am,

05:55.520 --> 06:00.160
I would be able to download my current project. I'd be able to open it in sublime and work on it.

06:01.520 --> 06:06.080
But when I'm home, I prefer to use GitHub to download my updates and everything

06:06.080 --> 06:11.280
and then work through VS Code. And funny enough, YouTube is very essential to me.

06:12.400 --> 06:18.960
I struggle to sit and read through a document of pages and pages. I just can't. So for me,

06:18.960 --> 06:22.480
I like YouTube, someone telling you do this, this and this, and then they type it out.

06:23.200 --> 06:27.040
So you can actually pause and go and do it yourself and then rinse and repeat until you

06:27.040 --> 06:32.400
get the hang of whatever you're doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I agree. There's

06:32.400 --> 06:39.440
definitely different modalities that work better for some people. That is why with the 150 days

06:39.440 --> 06:45.280
of HTML thingy that I'm putting together, I have incorporated video into the pages now so that if

06:45.280 --> 06:51.360
you're more of a video person, you can listen to me talk through the content, but you have the

06:51.360 --> 06:57.520
content just below you as a reference. I think that for me is something that I have understood

06:57.520 --> 07:02.960
more and more is giving people different ways to consume the same content because not everybody

07:02.960 --> 07:08.960
learns the same way. Is there anybody specifically on YouTube that you want to give a shout out to

07:08.960 --> 07:15.920
that you find is particularly good? Now you're asking me a question half. I do know his name.

07:15.920 --> 07:24.320
I just want to retrieve it. If I remember correctly, it's Mosh and he has a lot of coding

07:24.320 --> 07:31.200
tutorials online. His entire teaching style, the way he talks, explains, all of the little

07:31.200 --> 07:37.840
graphs and things he uses is amazing. I just really like learning this from this guy in particular.

07:39.200 --> 07:44.320
I'm trying to just get his name right now. If I remember correctly, it's Mosh.

07:45.440 --> 07:47.760
Sounds familiar. I think you've mentioned him to me as well.

07:47.760 --> 07:54.000
The one big problem I'm actually running into as a new developer is finding the information I need.

07:56.080 --> 08:03.040
Yeah. Yeah. So more often than not, I'd find myself asking what's next. I don't know what to learn

08:03.760 --> 08:10.400
from here on out. Unfortunately, I do rely on free resources at the moment

08:10.400 --> 08:17.360
because currently it's running from paycheck to paycheck. So I simply do not have the means to

08:18.080 --> 08:23.440
pay for courses quite yet, especially the online stuff gets really expensive really quickly.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.840
Yes, that's true.

08:27.120 --> 08:31.040
There we go. I found his name, Mosh Hamadani.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.560
All right. Cool. We should link him up in the

08:34.560 --> 08:39.840
send me the link afterwards and I'll put it in the show notes. And I'll probably reach out to him

08:39.840 --> 08:45.520
and see if I can do an interview with him on the podcast. Yeah, no, all of those things are very

08:45.520 --> 08:50.880
true. And I think what's kind of nice is something that's starting to get a little more traction is

08:50.880 --> 08:58.640
the idea of purchasing power parity pricing. It's always a hard one to say with the idea being that

08:58.640 --> 09:06.480
depending on where you live, they will geofence the content, but you will pay a smaller and lower

09:06.480 --> 09:11.680
amount based on where you live. Somebody that's really great with this is somebody like Ken C.

09:11.680 --> 09:18.560
Dodds. He's got all those courses about react and testing and all that kind of stuff. And if I,

09:18.560 --> 09:25.280
living in South Africa, purchase one of these courses, I get a 60% discount on that. So that's

09:25.280 --> 09:32.080
like a purchase is one of these courses. I get a 60% discount immediately just because of purchase

09:32.080 --> 09:38.080
parity pricing. So I think that's something that the industry as a whole should consider more

09:38.080 --> 09:43.760
widely because then they can make it because I understand why people ask money for courses.

09:43.760 --> 09:49.040
It's a heck of a lot of work. And if you want to do it well, it's especially a lot of work. And

09:49.040 --> 09:57.760
for some people, this is how they make a living. But it is tough when you come from a third world

09:57.760 --> 10:02.240
country or you're just starting out and you're still finding your feet and you don't have a bunch

10:02.240 --> 10:07.360
of money to invest yet. It is hard. There's all kinds of other interesting things developing

10:07.360 --> 10:12.480
around that idea as well. There's some academies and stuff in the United States exploring a different

10:12.480 --> 10:19.600
way of paying for your courses. But that is definitely, I think the thing that I get from you is that

10:19.600 --> 10:25.840
one big thing that's missing is a roadmap that you can look at, which points you at specific

10:25.840 --> 10:33.040
learning material based on where you are along your path and also which path you're on. Are you

10:33.040 --> 10:38.240
on a backend path? Are you on a full stack path or you're more on a front end path? Because you'll

10:38.240 --> 10:44.240
have different milestones and different learning material needs there. So I think that is something

10:44.240 --> 10:50.880
that we should look into, see if there are some resources to help there. Yeah, no, definitely.

10:50.880 --> 10:57.040
Because being in the front end developer, I've been working, learning, and then I reach a point

10:57.040 --> 11:05.840
and I just look at everything online. What now? Do I just invest my time into CSS? Do I just continue

11:05.840 --> 11:12.240
HTML, Java? What next? What do I need to do? What do I need to find? So I end up spending two to three

11:12.240 --> 11:17.360
hours searching for stuff to learn, running out of steam, learning for an hour or two, and then

11:17.360 --> 11:24.320
continuing with my day. Rather than having to go somewhere and spend those hours more, an hour

11:24.320 --> 11:29.520
finding this and this and this is what I need. And then two to three hours of learning whatever

11:29.520 --> 11:38.720
needs to come next. Yeah. I think communities such as the Mycelium Network can also help there,

11:38.720 --> 11:45.600
especially if we can get some more mentors to join our Discord server. And then where we're

11:45.600 --> 11:51.440
talking about the idea of having some meetups virtually and in person where possible. I think

11:51.440 --> 11:57.600
that'll help because there you can pose these kinds of questions and talk with other people.

11:57.600 --> 12:04.160
And often, more often than not, somebody else is being where you are and they can say,

12:04.160 --> 12:08.640
oh, I actually found this thing and it can kind of help you on your way. So I think

12:09.520 --> 12:15.120
investing in community and joining in on these communities and being active I think is one of

12:15.120 --> 12:19.840
the ways we can start solving this roadmap problem. But we have to get people from

12:19.840 --> 12:26.880
data learning and people who are teaching in the same place. A nice mix of two. So you don't have

12:26.880 --> 12:34.080
too many mentors and too little. So yeah, definitely. And it's quite a shy guy. It's

12:34.080 --> 12:39.920
very difficult for me to enter the community. I don't know why I've always had this thing about

12:39.920 --> 12:46.960
online communities. Even during my leisurely hours when I have gaming and stuff, I would not

12:46.960 --> 12:53.280
communicate with both people on the server. I just find it strange, you can say. So that was quite

12:53.280 --> 12:59.040
different for me. But what I found is you just jump in, find one thing you like, just drop a

12:59.040 --> 13:04.640
comment and see what happens. Because after that first comment, you find it's actually not that

13:04.640 --> 13:11.120
intimidating or scary. You can just go. Yeah, that's very true. And a lot of that comes down

13:11.120 --> 13:19.520
to also the people running the community. If you are focused and you start off with good

13:19.520 --> 13:25.200
community guidelines and you clearly enforce them, it helps a lot. Because there are

13:26.160 --> 13:34.240
bundles out there that just want to come and sour the pot. But as long as there's people that

13:34.800 --> 13:38.800
have their finger on the pulse and can quickly pick that up and make sure that those people are

13:38.800 --> 13:44.880
either kicked or reprimanded in a way that they understand that that kind of behavior is not

13:44.880 --> 13:51.040
welcome and their continued participation is going to hinge very heavily on them changing their

13:51.040 --> 13:56.880
attitude. I think that is important. And it's something that unfortunately has been a little

13:56.880 --> 14:03.680
rough on the internet, to put it mildly. Places got very toxic very quickly. And for me and you,

14:03.680 --> 14:10.160
it might be a little bit easier than for some genders and people of different races and

14:10.160 --> 14:18.160
ethnicities. For them, it's even harder to really feel comfortable in these groups. So big challenges

14:18.160 --> 14:22.160
that we have, but as long as we acknowledge them, then at least we're in the right direction.

14:22.160 --> 14:27.520
I think you've touched on a lot of the stuff from the next question I had in mind,

14:27.520 --> 14:32.480
but I'm going to pose it anyway, just in case there's anything else. So having talked about

14:32.480 --> 14:37.280
all of these resources and stuff. So clearly there's a bunch of things that don't work,

14:37.280 --> 14:41.600
but there are things that work. But if there's anything else that you feel on that doesn't work

14:41.600 --> 14:49.440
so great side that you want to highlight. The work that not works so great is a bit difficult.

14:50.400 --> 14:56.320
It does not work so great. The only thing I'm personally really stuck on is feeling lost.

14:56.320 --> 15:01.280
You're this drop that falls into an ocean, just kind of told swim. You don't know where you're

15:01.280 --> 15:05.440
going. You don't know which way. You don't know if you should swim down or up or what's going on.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.800
That's the only thing that's really missing for me. But that said, I do have you as a mentor as well.

15:11.440 --> 15:16.320
So I don't feel that lost. If I get stuck, you can meet up and just say,

15:16.320 --> 15:19.200
hey, listen, this is going on. How can we resolve this?

15:19.200 --> 15:26.160
How can we resolve this? That's the important thing to have

15:26.160 --> 15:32.080
and to nurture is this whole mental relationship. Because I do think that there's a lot of value

15:32.080 --> 15:37.600
there that I think a lot of people miss. Yeah, that's what I'm about to say. That's

15:37.600 --> 15:42.400
definitely something that's missing is finding someone you can ask a question to.

15:42.400 --> 15:48.880
To just ask, how do you had a heading in HTML? And not him having you laugh at you and just saying,

15:48.880 --> 15:56.400
oh, okay, let's help you. This is how we do it. This is why we do it. But I did not feel that

15:56.400 --> 16:01.440
personally, because I did start my journey with you. So I had that from the get go, but I can

16:01.440 --> 16:07.360
really see that being missing in a lot of people's startup, you can often have same.

16:07.360 --> 16:17.040
Yeah, for sure. That's true. I've been there also. And I know that I actually searched widely to try

16:17.040 --> 16:23.840
and find, is there any networks or mentorship programs or anything like that, that you can join?

16:23.840 --> 16:30.400
And there are some now, to be honest, that I should probably mention. I'll put some of the

16:30.400 --> 16:35.280
links to some of them in the show notes. Some stuff like Outreachy is really, really great.

16:35.280 --> 16:43.360
And they also focus on being very intrusive. Outreachy does some amazing work. And there are

16:43.360 --> 16:49.920
some other mentorship programs as well. But unfortunately, some of the mentorship things

16:49.920 --> 16:56.640
again, comes with a cost, which is understandable. But again, if you're not in a position to be able

16:56.640 --> 17:04.400
to pay, it is just another roadblock you have to face. And even though, you know, it's not

17:04.400 --> 17:10.640
easy, even though web development specifically, that's what I can talk to mostly, I've come a

17:10.640 --> 17:16.000
heck of a long way since the day was when I started. And a lot of things that used to be

17:16.000 --> 17:22.880
super hard are now trivially simple. It's still not easy. There's still a lot of questions that

17:22.880 --> 17:26.320
one has. So, you know, the need for that still exists very much.

17:26.320 --> 17:33.760
No, it definitely does. As for the roadblock of the payment is, I have looked into teaching myself,

17:34.320 --> 17:44.240
IT in general. So startup courses for old people or women, especially in my area, don't really know

17:44.240 --> 17:49.600
how computers work. That was a big thing for me. A lot of female older women don't know in the area.

17:49.600 --> 17:54.320
So I was looking to make something for them to teach them how computers work. And I completely

17:54.320 --> 18:03.040
understand why you charge so much for a course. It's a lot of hard work. It's a lot of information

18:03.040 --> 18:08.240
gathering and this and that. And you need to remember this. And even once I was ready to

18:08.240 --> 18:12.880
start, I still felt like I still have to go through a couple of things and make sure.

18:14.720 --> 18:20.640
I can totally understand why, but not having the funds necessarily available to

18:20.640 --> 18:27.760
you by let's say $60 for advanced courses will help you. It's quite a hindrance because now I

18:27.760 --> 18:35.600
have to go search. How can I get this information for free? Yeah. No, for sure. I completely get

18:35.600 --> 18:41.200
that. And the other thing with courses, of course, is that you have to, especially if you're asking

18:41.200 --> 18:47.360
money, is you have to keep it up to date. It's not something you make and then forget about because

18:47.360 --> 18:56.000
the tech industry evolves and moves quite fast. So that's the other part is if you want to keep it,

18:56.000 --> 18:59.600
if you want it to be useful, you have to keep it up to date.

19:01.120 --> 19:06.880
That is something as well, because I was following books from Microsoft. I was lucky enough to get

19:06.880 --> 19:13.920
access to those books and they fell into that trap. I would learn and learn and learn and learn it

19:13.920 --> 19:20.000
to some point and I'll hit a roadblock. It's been, what's this? It's not working. What's going on?

19:20.000 --> 19:24.960
And I have to go search for hours and hours and hours just to find out this phrase is no longer

19:24.960 --> 19:34.400
valid. Simply change X to Y and it works. Yeah. So that is definitely a pitfall. I can see some

19:34.400 --> 19:41.040
people falling into not keeping everything up to date. And it is frustrating for us who's new at

19:41.040 --> 19:47.200
learning these things because now where you would know this or know where to look for it, I need to

19:47.200 --> 19:52.320
spend two or three hours trying to find out why it's not working. What's going on? What's this error?

19:52.320 --> 19:58.960
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But teeing off the thing where you said you were looking at creating some

19:58.960 --> 20:04.000
courses to teach people other skills that you already have, I think in general, that is a good

20:04.000 --> 20:09.600
idea. And that's something that a lot of people knew to development. This doesn't matter what

20:09.600 --> 20:15.440
industry it is, are a little bit scared of, but that I would personally encourage is to write about

20:15.440 --> 20:23.120
the stuff that you learn because teaching is one of the best ways of learning. So if you've

20:23.120 --> 20:30.560
built something, anything, like write about how you made it. It doesn't necessarily have to tell

20:30.560 --> 20:36.960
a story per se about the struggles you had. It can literally just be you writing down how to make a

20:36.960 --> 20:44.880
responsive euro with HTML and CSS. Because by doing that, you are thinking through the process

20:44.880 --> 20:48.960
of having done that. Oftentimes you find ways that you can do it even better than what you've

20:48.960 --> 20:54.480
already done it. So you automatically improve your existing code base. And at the end of the day,

20:54.480 --> 20:59.920
you have a piece of writing that can also be useful for whether you start a business or whether

20:59.920 --> 21:04.480
you're looking for employment. You have something to point people to, to say, not only did I make

21:04.480 --> 21:08.000
this thing, but I wrote about how I did it. Because there's not a lot of people that can do

21:08.000 --> 21:11.840
both of those things. A lot of people are really good at writing the software, but they're not so

21:11.840 --> 21:16.640
great at teaching it. And more often than not, it's not that they don't have the skills. They

21:16.640 --> 21:22.240
just never exercise that skill. So as they exercise their coding skills, they don't exercise

21:22.240 --> 21:27.520
writing about their coding. And so that kind of never develops. So you have this amazing

21:27.520 --> 21:32.400
software engineer, but if he tries to explain something to you, it's like right over your head,

21:32.400 --> 21:39.280
because they'd never go back and think about how did I, what did I do before I knew how to do this?

21:39.280 --> 21:46.480
How did I get to that point? What was the things that I, what were the things I did wrong? And how

21:46.480 --> 21:51.920
did I find a better way and stuff like that. So I think while you're learning writing about the stuff

21:51.920 --> 21:59.280
that you make is incredibly important. You just gave me a great idea to maybe branch off of my

21:59.280 --> 22:08.640
existing URL to start something to score RWS journey. Just a place we can write. I made a

22:08.640 --> 22:15.040
navigation bar today by using this, this, and this. I hit this roadblock, but I found this information

22:15.040 --> 22:20.640
there. So if someone does read it, they can say, that's my problem. So I can just go look over there

22:20.640 --> 22:28.400
to go fix it. Because something I hit a hard roadblock with is including JSON. So I can just

22:28.400 --> 22:34.400
add JSON into my project. So everyone was just like, no, just add it, just install it, just do it.

22:34.960 --> 22:41.120
Like, yeah, how, how do I do this? And after like two or three hours, I was like, oh, I just make a

22:41.120 --> 22:47.040
text file, change the name and paste the stuff in and include it into my job and bam, Bob's your uncle.

22:48.480 --> 22:53.360
Then again, just that little bit of knowledge I couldn't find for about two to three hours,

22:53.360 --> 23:00.960
because everyone just explains how to use it, not how to implement it. Gotcha. And it's literally

23:00.960 --> 23:07.360
because people just don't think that far back anymore. For them using JSON is just a thing you

23:07.360 --> 23:13.120
do. Like it's just text. What are you talking about? But it's like, no, but if you don't know,

23:14.080 --> 23:19.600
if you don't know what JSON is and how it fits into the larger framework of building a,

23:19.600 --> 23:24.880
let's take for example, the one tool that I built developer tool chest. All that is in the end of

23:24.880 --> 23:32.880
the day is a website that loads some JSON that has a specific structure and it loops through them.

23:32.880 --> 23:38.880
And for each entry, it makes little block based on the search filter that you typed in. But if you

23:38.880 --> 23:46.240
don't know how JSON fits into that whole thing, it can be like, wait, what is this JSON now? Is it a

23:46.240 --> 23:53.200
database? It's like kind of, not really. So it's understanding that no, JSON is just a flight text

23:53.200 --> 24:02.400
file that has certain limitations placed upon it. And JSON in the end is data. So this is like the

24:02.400 --> 24:08.560
data part of your project. You describe data inside your JSON document and then you can consume

24:08.560 --> 24:14.560
it as if it's like a database, kind of. Just a very, very loose database. I don't know if you've

24:14.560 --> 24:23.840
ever looked up SQLite, but if you haven't, it doesn't matter. Just maybe after the podcast,

24:23.840 --> 24:28.960
just have a search for SQLite. And SQLite is essentially just a flat text file on your hard

24:28.960 --> 24:37.760
drive that acts as a database. But you can query the data as if it's SQL. That's why SQLite. And

24:37.760 --> 24:42.800
like it's in everything. It's in everything. Like your mobile phone, your everything. It's

24:42.800 --> 24:49.840
everywhere. SQLite is like everywhere. Okay. I already opened a tab of VF after we're done. So

24:49.840 --> 24:55.600
that's one of those great reads. And that also reminded me, that's something I see a lot of

24:55.600 --> 25:01.840
mentors fall, I want to say fall short, but I don't know if that's the right word. That's why

25:01.840 --> 25:09.520
I like following Mosh. He says, use an H1 tag to add a title. And a lot of people just move on.

25:09.520 --> 25:14.560
But for me personally, I want to know why. What does it do? How does it work? And what he does

25:14.560 --> 25:19.600
is he pulls up the graph and tells you, H1 does this. It adds a title. It does this. This is how

25:19.600 --> 25:25.040
you use it. This is how you can use it. So that is something I've been struggling with as well.

25:25.760 --> 25:30.480
Because I've been following someone doing a text adventure game, because that was interesting to

25:30.480 --> 25:37.040
me. This guy would just type, no, use this, this, this, enter, and go to the next thing. I'm like,

25:37.040 --> 25:43.280
wait, why? Why did you do this? How does this work? You didn't explain to me anything. You just wrote

25:43.280 --> 25:48.240
code on a little pad and moved on. So you didn't actually teach me anything. You just showed me

25:48.240 --> 25:57.040
what you can do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess there's a place for that. But I think more often

25:57.040 --> 26:01.280
than not, you find that a lot on Twitch, like a lot of people on Twitch would stream them working.

26:01.280 --> 26:07.520
And the idea is not to, you might pick up some stuff by watching, but that's not their intent.

26:07.520 --> 26:13.200
Their intent is just like, I'm doing some stuff and maybe I want to be held accountable. And

26:13.200 --> 26:17.760
therefore I will stream every day between five and seven, and I'll work on this specific project.

26:18.400 --> 26:23.200
It's more a way of keeping themselves accountable. And if somebody learned something out of it,

26:23.200 --> 26:28.640
then great, but that's not the intent. But yeah, that's, that's all good stuff. So I'm wondering,

26:28.640 --> 26:34.800
so looking towards the future, Sam, I'm going to, I'm going to, it was two separate questions,

26:34.800 --> 26:42.240
but I think I'm going to throw it into one question. Okay. So you can do one or two things.

26:42.240 --> 26:48.160
Like you can learn and learn and learn and eventually apply for a job and work for somebody

26:48.160 --> 26:53.520
else. Or you can do the other thing, which is create your own opportunity by starting your own

26:53.520 --> 26:59.600
business, whether that is building a product or starting an agency where you create websites and

26:59.600 --> 27:05.920
design for other people. But I think in both of those areas, it doesn't really matter which one

27:05.920 --> 27:13.360
you choose. This idea of an interview is part of both. The difference being on the one hand,

27:13.360 --> 27:18.320
you're interviewing for a specific position at a specific company. The other one you're being

27:18.320 --> 27:24.000
interviewed by a client who wants to know that if I give you money, I'll get a website and return.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.800
So therefore I need to, you know, I'm just not blindly going to give you money. I want to speak

27:28.800 --> 27:34.880
to you a little bit. And it's also a kind of an interview. So my question is, which one of the two

27:34.880 --> 27:42.000
is of most interest to you, like starting a business or working for somebody. And based on

27:42.000 --> 27:49.920
that, what is the things about these interviews that perhaps scare you a little bit? Okay.

27:49.920 --> 27:54.800
Personally, I'd like to start my own business. I walked out of high school into my permanent job

27:55.600 --> 28:02.640
working for about three years as a retail salesperson. And after that, I got the

28:02.640 --> 28:09.840
opportunity for better hours, more pay doing school photos. So I've been working for a while

28:09.840 --> 28:14.720
now. So I've been working there for three years now as well. So I've been basically working

28:14.720 --> 28:19.920
since I got out of high school and I've reached a point where I've had enough of making someone

28:19.920 --> 28:24.240
else rich. I've got a lot of knowledge. I've got a lot of experience with a lot of things.

28:24.240 --> 28:28.640
I do feel like I want to start my own thing and I want to get away from working for someone else.

28:29.680 --> 28:34.480
I want to start my own business. I'm starting my own thing, which I already have started.

28:34.480 --> 28:39.280
I'm still looking for clients now. I've got one client pending. We still need to do this

28:39.280 --> 28:46.640
interview you're talking about. But having about three years worth of sales experience,

28:46.640 --> 28:50.240
the interviews are a fun part for me. I look forward to it and it's exciting.

28:54.320 --> 28:59.840
I can definitely see the scary bits of it, having to explain to someone why to use you.

29:00.720 --> 29:06.560
But what I always found in sales is if you use the term faker to make it, you can sell a pen

29:06.560 --> 29:12.960
to a pen factory. If you stand there with a smile and they ask you, can you do back-end

29:12.960 --> 29:17.840
developments and do this whole database thing? And tell them, yeah, sure. I do have to do some

29:17.840 --> 29:23.600
research. I do need to freshen up on a couple of things, but let's talk. Let's see what you can do.

29:23.600 --> 29:29.760
And I'll tell you yes or no, I can or cannot assist you. Then a client's more likely to use you,

29:29.760 --> 29:33.120
if you're honest about things like that. Because they don't feel you're trying to

29:33.120 --> 29:38.560
scam them out of money. They do feel like, okay, yeah, I do know what I'm doing. I just need to

29:38.560 --> 29:44.560
sharpen up. So then already feel like, oh, okay. So you're not just someone looking for a quick

29:44.560 --> 29:49.760
buck. You're actually interested in the work. Yeah, honesty goes a long way in business.

29:49.760 --> 29:55.120
That's for sure. And I mean, I say that knowing full well that the business industry can be a

29:55.120 --> 30:00.960
bit of a cutthroat industry as well. But I think you have to have morals for yourself and for your

30:00.960 --> 30:09.760
business. And like me personally, for me as well, I have very fine lines of the type of clients I'd

30:09.760 --> 30:13.920
be willing to work with and ones I wouldn't be willing to work with. And I think there I

30:13.920 --> 30:19.520
shield myself a little bit from this cutthroat, like it's all about the money kind of thing.

30:19.520 --> 30:24.240
Yeah, I think it's great. I think it's great to be honest and open that, sure, I can do this.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.920
This specific part of the project might be a little bit more challenging, but

30:27.920 --> 30:34.560
you know, I have enough experience in how to find answers. That's what I do is I find solutions to

30:34.560 --> 30:41.760
problem. The technology is almost kind of the easy part. Mentally finding a solution is

30:42.960 --> 30:47.680
lots of times harder than actually writing the code. It's understanding what is the problem

30:47.680 --> 30:54.880
that the client's facing. How do I best solve this? And then what technology do I need to employ in

30:54.880 --> 31:00.320
order to solve this? Because oftentimes people will come to you with a preconceived idea in their

31:00.320 --> 31:05.040
head, because they've heard it from a friend, but it might not necessarily be the best solution for

31:05.040 --> 31:10.240
them. There might be something better that's come along since they've framed it their thing.

31:10.240 --> 31:16.080
Their friend might actually also benefit from your services. And because they might not know

31:16.080 --> 31:20.000
that there's a better way to do this now, that could actually save them money or, you know,

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
help them grow their business faster. I'm always excited when I hear people wanting to start their

31:26.000 --> 31:32.800
own businesses, because if we look at unemployment in the world, the need for jobs is massive. And

31:32.800 --> 31:39.360
it is for each of us that starts our own little business and start networking with each other.

31:39.360 --> 31:43.680
We're creating opportunities for ourselves, but down the line, we're creating opportunities for

31:43.680 --> 31:50.400
others. And the nice thing about somebody like yourself, for example, sorting a business is,

31:50.400 --> 31:56.240
you know, the pain of having to learn this stuff and having to find a job where people say,

31:56.240 --> 32:02.400
oh, how much experience do you have? While working experience, not yet, but I've done all these.

32:02.400 --> 32:06.880
Oh, no, no, no, we're looking for something five years experience, sorry. So you'll be more open

32:06.880 --> 32:12.720
to listening to somebody and giving them a chance and telling them, you know what, come work. I'll

32:12.720 --> 32:17.760
pay you a full salary for a month and let's see how it goes. If by the end of the month,

32:17.760 --> 32:25.200
I can see that you could do the job, well, let's just keep going. But if I find that after a month

32:25.200 --> 32:31.120
that you can even struggle, but if you're willing to learn and you're willing to do what's necessary

32:31.120 --> 32:37.120
to get the work done, I'm happy to employ you. I think the more that we can get that kind of

32:37.120 --> 32:44.000
thing going, the better. Yeah. And that sense that is something I find very difficult. I've been on

32:44.000 --> 32:49.520
a lot of platforms like Upwork and so on, looking for jobs and I find stuff and I look at them like,

32:49.520 --> 32:55.440
I can do this. I can do everything you need. I have all the requirements. I've got the technology.

32:55.440 --> 32:59.840
I've got the background. I've got an internet connection. I've got all of this. The only thing

32:59.840 --> 33:05.440
I'm lacking is the three years of experience I must have you're looking for. Yeah. And finding

33:05.440 --> 33:12.160
that one person that says, Hey, listen, this is your opportunity. Just try, let's see what you can

33:12.160 --> 33:18.800
do. That's all you need. That's all you need. That one guy that just says, I'm willing to give you

33:18.800 --> 33:22.800
a month's worth of work. Let's see what you're doing. How are you doing? How are you handling

33:22.800 --> 33:28.640
this? On a little bit of a side tangent, the interview, just circling back to the interviews,

33:28.640 --> 33:37.760
I do have some advice for people. I turn it around. If I have a client comes to me, they can just find

33:37.760 --> 33:44.480
my wording. I am interviewing them. I get them to tell me what they need. I get to tell them what

33:44.480 --> 33:49.600
they get them to tell me what they are looking for, what they are looking to do. So they'll come to

33:49.600 --> 33:54.000
me on three pages. I want this done. I want that done. I want this there. They'll be like, okay,

33:54.000 --> 33:59.360
they'll be like, okay, well, this I can do for you. This I can do for you. It's very difficult. It

33:59.360 --> 34:04.640
takes long. So you are going to be charged more for this because instead of just a quick, quick

34:04.640 --> 34:09.520
hours with the work, this can take me about three or four hours, but I can do it another way for you.

34:10.960 --> 34:15.840
So instead of sitting there and wondering, like, I'm, I'm being interviewed. I turn it around.

34:15.840 --> 34:21.360
I ask them, what are you looking for? What do you want? What do you want out of this website?

34:21.360 --> 34:26.880
Because obviously I can say whatever I want. And I might just go off in a site engine for an hour,

34:26.880 --> 34:32.160
just speaking about myself and what I did, not answering any questions. Where if I tell the

34:32.160 --> 34:38.480
client, what's your question? Then I answer, what's your next question? And I answer. And you ask a

34:38.480 --> 34:43.120
question, I say something like, wait a second, this is not how it works. We can't do it this way.

34:43.120 --> 34:49.920
We can do it this way, this way, or this way. Clients love having options. Yeah. So it's,

34:49.920 --> 34:55.520
you pretty much flipped the interview around and you're interviewing them now. Because at the end

34:55.520 --> 35:01.520
of the day, you do need to know from them what you need to do. Oh, yes. And having that person just

35:01.520 --> 35:06.240
ask you the entire time, what do you want? What are you looking for? Yes, I can do this for you.

35:06.240 --> 35:11.680
No, I cannot do this for you. Feels a lot easier than I sell websites. I make websites, go look

35:11.680 --> 35:18.480
over there. I can make a navigation bar. I can. Then you change it all from me, me, me to them.

35:18.480 --> 35:27.360
And you change the focus point around on them. And I feel very special if I can state it like that.

35:28.240 --> 35:32.000
Yeah, no, for sure. No, that's great advice. Yeah. Thanks for sharing that.

35:33.440 --> 35:38.720
This was really cool. I really enjoyed this. I'm looking forward to seeing where you go and

35:39.280 --> 35:46.960
what you do with your business. So before we officially wrap it up, is there any projects

35:46.960 --> 35:51.120
you're currently working on that you like to tell everybody about? This can be open source,

35:51.120 --> 35:56.560
can be side projects, doesn't matter, client projects that you can talk about, or any like

35:56.560 --> 36:02.160
links that you'd like people to know about. And of course, we'll have them all also in the

36:02.160 --> 36:06.560
show notes. But if you want to give some specific shout outs, then go for it.

36:07.760 --> 36:13.840
Not quite at the moment. I do have a client outstanding that is going, everything points

36:13.840 --> 36:19.040
are going to use me to create their website. They do work with aluminum and door frames and

36:20.160 --> 36:28.080
they install them for different houses all around our area here in Pretoria. So I will

36:28.080 --> 36:32.720
love to share that journey. Like you said, I would love to make a blog for a journey

36:32.720 --> 36:39.520
of how I will create that. But as of now, I still need all the information. So I haven't started

36:39.520 --> 36:45.600
yet, but I have started planning. I have started looking at designs and color schemes and stuff

36:45.600 --> 36:54.080
like that. The only current project I do have is my own website, which is rwswebdesign.co.za.

36:55.200 --> 37:00.240
It is currently live. I have been communicating with our community, improving some stuff,

37:00.240 --> 37:06.160
changing grammar, updating some of my graphics. And I do keep it up to date because this will be

37:06.160 --> 37:16.160
my private business website from year on. That's great. Can you just repeat that URL for us?

37:16.160 --> 37:25.520
That's rwswebdesign.co.za. Okay. rwswebdesign.co.za. Go check it out, folks.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.960
So other than that, the side projects I don't really have at the moment,

37:30.960 --> 37:37.120
I would like to give a shout out to FreeCodeCamp.org. You actually gave me this site a bit

37:37.120 --> 37:44.720
earlier this week, I think. It's an amazing platform so far for me to learn. They do start

37:44.720 --> 37:50.000
from the very basics, which is a bit annoying. They got about four or five exercises in, and

37:50.000 --> 37:55.840
they've already taught me something new of the basics. I didn't know. So far, it feels like an

37:55.840 --> 38:02.080
amazing tutorial, especially for beginners to start at because they start simple, easy to understand.

38:02.720 --> 38:05.200
They've got documentation, all of that good things.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.680
Yeah. And the great thing about FreeCodeCamp is, well, it's free, but

38:11.280 --> 38:18.320
beyond that, it's built by a community of contributors. So one, it's kept up to date,

38:18.320 --> 38:24.960
constantly being improved. And you yourself, like Riku, that's learning, you can contribute back to

38:24.960 --> 38:29.680
that project, even if it's just a small thing where you maybe find the wording of something not

38:29.680 --> 38:34.880
as understandable as you'd like to be. It's an open source project. You can fork it, open a pull

38:34.880 --> 38:41.120
request and propose something that you feel would improve it. So I think it's really great to be

38:41.120 --> 38:44.640
involved with projects like that. And as one of the other ones that I'll give a shout out to,

38:44.640 --> 38:49.280
because I'm quite involved with them, that is in the same vein. It's an open source project. All

38:49.280 --> 38:55.760
the content is right there. It's community written. There are some people paid to work on it, but it's

38:55.760 --> 39:01.920
a massive open source project. So I think being involved in these projects is great. And there's

39:01.920 --> 39:07.760
a lot of wonderful people behind these projects that would be happy to receive pull requests. So

39:07.760 --> 39:14.320
I can personally send an invitation to everybody listening to both go check out FreeCodeCamp and

39:14.320 --> 39:20.800
MDN Web Docs on GitHub and on the web and learn, contribute. It's all good. It's all learning

39:20.800 --> 39:27.840
experience. So yeah, thanks for sharing that. Yeah. So yeah, no, there is something I would like to

39:27.840 --> 39:36.080
go back and actually donate to FreeCodeCamp, not if, when my business takes off. When I become

39:36.080 --> 39:40.480
a success, I would love to go back and actually donate to them. And that is something I am very

39:40.480 --> 39:48.320
appreciative of them. They don't cap their learning based on paygates. You are busy working and it

39:48.320 --> 39:53.200
pops up like, Hey, listen, would you like to donate? I just look ashamed. Like, no, not now.

39:54.400 --> 39:58.880
Maybe, maybe once my first site takes off and I've made my first sale, I'll come back and I'll

39:58.880 --> 40:04.800
come donate something. I've totally done that. I've totally done that with a couple of open

40:04.800 --> 40:10.960
source things where it's been just like, I wouldn't be where I am without it. And so now

40:10.960 --> 40:16.240
that I am where I am, I totally just go and do a monthly, like set up a monthly donation

40:17.120 --> 40:21.360
because I want it to be around for the next generation and I want it to keep improving.

40:21.920 --> 40:28.080
So yeah, I think that's great that you're also already preparing yourself for doing that.

40:28.080 --> 40:33.120
It's great stuff. Well, thanks Rico. It was really great. Thanks for being the first guest

40:33.120 --> 40:38.640
on the My CD and Metro podcast. I hope this is going to be one of many, many, many, and

40:38.640 --> 40:43.440
we'll do one again once, once your business is huge and you've got like hundreds of employees.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.440
That's been great. Thank you for having me. It's been quite an experience. Always nice to

40:49.440 --> 40:53.680
sit and speak to someone about these kinds of things. Yeah. Not just sitting in your own mind,

40:53.680 --> 40:59.440
just thinking about all of this stuff and just feeling stuck. So I would actually recommend it

40:59.440 --> 41:03.440
for shy people as well. Get a community, join a community and just start speaking with people.

41:04.320 --> 41:10.480
It really lightens the load if you say it like that. Yeah, it's been quite a pleasure.

41:12.080 --> 41:16.880
Same for me. Thank you for listening to this episode of the My CD and Metro podcast.
