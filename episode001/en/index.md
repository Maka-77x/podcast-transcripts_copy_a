# The Mycelium Network Podcast Episode One with **Rico Smit**

**Schalk Neethling**
Hey everyone. And welcome to the very first episode of the [Mycelium network podcast](https://anchor.fm/the-mycelium-network), a podcast all about new people to the development world and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way. Today, we are going to have a chat with **Rico Smit**. He is one of the people that joined the Mycelium network very early on and has been pretty active in the community.

So I thought it only appropriate to have him as one of the first guests. Hey Rico, and welcome to the podcast.

**Rico Smit**
Hi, thanks for having me.

**Schalk Neethling**
It's a pleasure. How are you doing today?

**Rico Smit**
It's been a rough day. I've done a lot cleaning-wise, studying, and sleeping during load-shedding.

**Schalk Neethling**
Yeah, load-shedding complicates everything. Okay. Let's get right into this.

So, I've sent some of these questions to you before, just so you can be a little bit more prepared, but we will be off the cuff, some things here and there. No pressure, just an informal chat to learn what works and doesn't work, the challenges you're facing, and how the mentors I speak with can help.

So to get us off to a start, tell us a bit about your background. What did you do up to now, and what made you look into getting into software or web development specifically?

**Rico Smit**
I was born and raised here in Pretoria, my uncle has been very heavy into technology. So ever since I was little, I remember standing by him and seeing what he was doing/creating, and it intrigued me from a young age.

And then, throughout high school, I had the opportunity to take IT and actually discovered the love for coding, and I had a chance to get all of the fundamentals down. But as soon as that ended, I had to walk out into a job. I worked in retail for a hardware shop. So I did what I had to do to survive, but it's not what I wanted to do.

I always had this feeling that I wanna do something else. The first course I had with you was where I realized how much I love web development above stuff like app development, server work, or security. I realized I love working with the web creating pages, and designing new things.

I just fell in love with it.

**Schalk Neethling**
That's great.

**Rico Smit**
I'm looking to study now. But, at the end of the day, I would like to be a full stack developer, being able to do everything in anything that is necessary.

**Schalk Neethling**
I think it's good to have that as a goal, but I want to mention the concept of being T-shaped in terms of your skills.

So you have a broad knowledge base, but then you have something you specialize in. As for myself, I know about back-end development, and I've done stuff like Python a little bit and even databases. Like the old relational type of databases. I say old, but people definitely still use relation relational databases today.

But I am definitely focused on front-end development. And, as they say, front of the front, so I like the design aspects; I like CSS and making things look good and work well, performance, and accessibility. So those things are critical to me. So I think it's good to have that broader perspective of what happens in the industry, but it's always nice to have something that is your focus area. An area where you really go deep, as they say.

So you have this breadth, and then you have depth in a particular area. I did not start in tech but got into web development from a music background. For me, the nice thing about the web in the early days was [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), when it was still around. It had this capability where I could take the musical, design, and programming and mix them all.

We used to make these Flash intros, which were like little movies that used to play before you'd actually enter the website. A little movie with text and animation and whatnot. And then it would say, click to enter. That used to be a huge thing back in the day. So I understand starting something and then being bitten by this web thing and digging into it.

**Rico Smit**
I must say I am more interested in the front-end side of things. It feels like I would like to know the back-end part to make things simpler if you do get stuck, but I am most definitely more interested in front-end development. I don't really find, for example, PHP interesting.

I hate SQL. We had to do some in high school, and I absolutely hated it.

**Schalk Neethling**
Now that we know about your background, how you came to where you are, and what you're looking to do for your future. One of the main things you mentioned is the need to learn.

So as you're learning, which resources have you really come to depend on?

**Rico Smit**
I've got three, well, actually four now. I really like the input I get from you. We get together and chat about things and places to find something to help. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has become very essential for me.

I also tried [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/). It is very bare bones and is pretty amazing. If you have a laptop, are traveling around, and have a moment, you can quickly open it up and edit something. It's also very small, much smaller than VSCode, so it's easier for me to carry around on a flash drive.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is amazing, and using [GitHub](https://github.com), in general, is essential because wherever I am, I can download my current project, open it in Sublime and work on it. I download my updates when I'm home and work using VSCode. Funny enough, YouTube is very essential to me. I struggle to read through pages and pages of documents. I just can't. So for me, I appreciate having access to YouTube.

Someone telling you to do this, this, and this, and then they type it out. So you can pause and do it yourself and then rinse and repeat until you get the hang of whatever you're doing.

**Schalk Neethling**
There are definitely different modalities that work better for some people than others. So that is why I have incorporated video into the pages with the [150 days of HTML](https://150daysofhtml.com/) project. So, if you are a video person, you can listen and watch me talk through the content.

But, you have the content just below you as a reference. So, I think that that is something that I have realized is giving people different ways to consume the same content. Because not everybody learns the same way. Is there anybody on YouTube that you want to shout out to that you find particularly good?

**Rico Smit**
If I remember correctly, it's [Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh). He has a lot of coding tutorials online, his entire teaching style, the way he talks and explains, and all of the little graphs and things he uses are amazing. I just really like learning this from this person in particular.

The one big problem I have as a new developer is finding the information I need. So more often than not, I'd find myself asking what's next. I don't know what to learn from here on out. I do rely on free resources at the moment because I currently live from paycheck to paycheck. So I simply do not have the means to pay for courses quite yet. Especially online gets really expensive really quickly.

**Schalk Neethling**
All of those points are very true. The idea of [purchasing power parity pricing](https://www.investopedia.com/updates/purchasing-power-parity-ppp/) is getting a little more traction. That's always a hard one to say with all the p sounds. The idea is that, depending on where you live, they will geo-fence the content, but you will pay a lower amount based on where you live. Someone really great with this is [Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/). He's got all these great courses about React and writing tests.

If I, living in South Africa, purchases one of these courses, I get a 60% discount immediately. So I think that's something that the industry should consider more widely. I understand why people ask for money for courses; it's a heck of a lot of work. And if you wanna do it well, it's especially a lot of work and, for some people, this is how they make a living. But it is tough when you come from a developing country, or you're just starting out and still finding your feet. You don't have a bunch of money to invest just yet.

Other interesting things are developing around that idea as well. For example, some academies in the United States are exploring a different way of paying for your courses. But, what I get from you is that the one big thing missing is a roadmap. A roadmap you can look at, which points you at specific learning material based on where you are along your path, and also which path you're on.

Are you on a back-end or full-stack path, or are you more on a front-end path? Because you will have different milestones and different learning material needs. So I think that is something that we should look into. See if there are some resources to help here.

**Rico Smit**
Being in front-end development, I've been working and learning, and then I reach a point and just look at everything online and wonder, what now? Do I just invest my time in CSS, or do I continue with HTML or JavaScript? What's next? What do I need to do? What do I need to find? So I spend two to three hours searching for stuff to learn, running out of steam learning for an hour or two, and then continuing with my day, rather than finding the things I need and then two to three hours of learning.

**Schalk Neethling**
I think communities such as the [Mycelium Network](https://github.com/The-Mycelium-Network/) can also help there, especially if we can get more mentors to join the Discord server. We are also discussing the idea of having some virtual and in-person meetings where possible. I think that'll help because there you can pose this kind of questions and, you know, talk with other people. And more often than not, somebody else has been where you are, and they can say, oh, I actually found this resource, and it can help you on your way.

So I think investing in the community, joining these communities, and being active, are one of the ways that we can start solving this roadmap problem. But, we must get people learning and teaching in the same place.

**Rico Smit**
I am quite a shy guy, so it was very difficult for me to enter the community. I don't know why I've always had this thing about online communities. Even during my leisurely gaming hours, I would not communicate with people on the server. I just find it strange.

So that was quite difficult for me. But I found that you just jump in, find one thing you like, and drop a comment and see what happens. Because after that first comment, you will find it's not intimidating or scary.

**Schalk Neethling**
Yeah, that's very true, and a lot of that comes down to also the people running the community. So, if you are focused and start with good community guidelines you clearly enforce, it helps a lot. Because there are, as you know, but-holes out there that just wanna come and sour the pot. But, as long as moderators have their finger on the pulse and make sure those people are reprimanded in a way that they understand that kind of behavior is not welcome. And their continued participation will hinge very heavily on them changing their attitude. So, I think that is important, and it's something that has been a little rough on the internet, to put it mildly. Places got very toxic very quickly. And for you and me, it might be a bit easier than for some genders and people of different races and ethnicities. For them, it's even harder to really feel comfortable in these groups.

So, we have some big challenges, but as long as we acknowledge them, we're in the right direction. You've touched on a lot of the stuff from this next question I had in mind, but I'm going to ask it anyway, just in case there's anything else. Having talked about all of these resources. There are a bunch of things that don't work, but there are things that work. Is there anything else you want to highlight that doesn't work so well?

**Rico Smit**
The only thing I'm personally really stuck on is feeling lost. You are this drop that falls into an ocean, and you just have to swim. The thing is, you don't know where you're going. You don't know which way, you don't know if you should swim down or up, you don't know what's going on. That is the main thing that's really missing for me.

But that said, I do have you as a mentor. So I don't feel that lost. So if I get stuck, I can meet up and say, Hey, listen, this is going on. How can we resolve this?

**Schalk Neethling**
So clearly, that's an important thing to have and to nurture. Having a healthy mentor and mentee relationship. I do think that there's a lot of value there.

**Rico Smit**
That's definitely something that's missing, finding someone you can ask a question to. So, for example, how do you add a heading in HTML? And not have the person laugh at you. But instead, just saying, oh, okay, let's help you. This is how we do it, which is why we do it this way.

But I did not feel that personally because I did start my journey with you. So I had that from the get-go, but I can see that being missing for many people.

**Schalk Neethling**
I've also been there and searched widely to find if there are any networks, mentorship programs, or anything like that I could join. There are some now that I should probably mention.

I'll add some links to some of them in the show notes. For example, [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) is really great. They also focus on being very inclusive. There are some other mentorship programs as well. Unfortunately, some of the mentorship programs again come with a cost, which is understandable.

But again, if you're not in a position to be able to pay, it is just another roadblock you have to face. And, you know, web development specifically, as that is what I can talk to, has come a heck of a long way since I started. So many things that used to be super hard are now trivially simple.

It's still not easy; there are still a lot of questions that one has. So, you know, the need for that still exists very much.

**Rico Smit**
As for the roadblock of the payment, I have looked into teaching myself IT in general. So startup courses for older adults or women. Especially in my area, many people don't really know how computers work.

That was a big thing for me. A lot of older women don't know. So I was looking at making something for them, teaching them how computers work. And I completely understand why you charge so much for a course. It's a lot of hard work. It's a lot of information gathering.

And even once I was ready to start, I still felt I had to go through a couple of things and ensure everything was accurate. So I understand why, but not having the funds available to pay, let's say $60 for the advanced course you know will help you. It's quite a hindrance because now I have to search for alternatives where you can get this information for free.

**Schalk Neethling**
The other thing with courses is that, especially if you're asking for money, you must keep it up to date. It's not something you make and then forget about because, you know, the tech industry evolves and moves quite fast. So that's the other of it, if you want it to be helpful, you have to keep it up to date.

**Rico Smit**
That is something as well. I was following books from Microsoft that I was lucky enough to access. But they fell into that trap. I would learn and learn and learn, and at some point, I'll hit a roadblock where something is not working. Now, I have to search for hours just to find out that this phrase is no longer valid. Simply change X to Y, and it works. So that is definitely a pitfall I can see some people falling into. Not keeping everything up to date.

**Schalk Neethling**
Teeing off something you said earlier, you were thinking of creating some courses to teach people the skills you already have. I believe, in general, that is a good idea. And that's something that many people new to development are a little bit scared of, but that I would encourage. Write about the stuff that you learn.

Because teaching is one of the best ways of learning. If you've built something, write about how you created it. It doesn't necessarily need to tell a story about your struggles. It can really just be you writing down how to make a responsive hero with HTML and CSS, for example.

Because by doing that, you are thinking through the process of having done that. Often you find ways to improve on what you've already done, which can then improve your existing code base. So at the end of the day, you have a piece of writing that can also be useful whether you start a business or are looking for employment.

You have something to point people to and say; not only did I make this, but I wrote about how I made it. And there are not a lot of people that can do both of those things. Many people are good at writing software but not so great at teaching. And more often than not, it's not that they don't have the skills; they just never exercise those skills. So like they would exercise their coding skill, they should exercise writing about the code they wrote. So you find these fantastic software engineers, but if they try to explain something, it goes right over your head. It is not their fault; they had just forgotten about when they did not understand this topic.

What were the things that I did wrong, and how did I find a better way. So I think writing about the stuff you make is incredibly important while learning.

**Rico Smit**
You gave me a great idea to branch off of my existing URL and start something just called RWSWebDesign's journey.

Just a place we can write. For example, I made a navigation bar today using this, this, and this. I hit this roadblock, but I found this information that helped me solve the problem. So if someone does read it, they can say, that's my problem. I have now saved someone from going through the same struggle of finding the correct information. For example, I recently encountered a challenging roadblock with including JSON in my project.

All the resources I could find regarding [JSON](https://www.json.org/) just assumed you knew what it was and how to use it. But I wanted to understand what it is and how to use it. After about two or three hours of searching, I finally realized, oh, I just create a text file. I have to use the .json file extension and then simply paste the code into the file, include it into my job, and bam, Bob's your uncle. But again, gaining just that little knowledge took me about two to three hours.

Because everyone just explains how to use it, not how to implement it.

**Schalk Neethling**
I believe it is because people don't think that far back anymore. For them using JSON is just something you do. It's just a text file. What are you talking about? But if you do not know what JSON is and how it fits into the larger framework of building a website or application, that is a valid question. Let's take, for example, the tool I am making, the [developer tool chest](https://developer-toolchest.com/).

All it is is a website that loads some JSON with a specific structure and loops through the content of the JSON file. For each entry, it outputs a little block based on the search filter that you typed in. But if you don't know how JSON fits into all of that, it can be confusing? JSON? Is it a database? Kind of, in this particular instance. So, you know, it's understanding that JSON is just a text file with certain limitations. To describe it more accurately, it is a text file that follows a defined set of rules for how the content needs to be formatted. JSON is data. It is the data of your project. You describe the data inside your JSON document, and then you can consume it as if it's a database.

I don't know if you've ever looked up [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), but if you haven't, SQLite is essentially just a flat text file on your hard drive that acts as a database. It is super lightweight, hence the name SQLite. And like it's in everything, like your mobile phone for example.

**Rico Smit**
That's why I like following Mosh. He says you can use an H1 tag to add a title, which is where many people will stop and move on. Personally, I want to know why? What does it do? How does it work? So, he pulls up a graph and tells you H1 does this, and this is how and when you use it.

So that is something I've been struggling with as well. I've been following someone doing a text adventure game because that was interesting to me. This person would just start typing with no explanation as to why. I'm like, wait, why, why did you do this? How does this work?

In the end, he didn't explain anything; he just wrote code on a little pad and moved on. So he didn't actually teach me anything. You just showed me what he can do.

**Schalk Neethling**
And there is a place for that. I know on Twitch, people often have live streams of themselves working. In these instances, the idea is not necessarily to teach. While you may learn something by watching, that's not their intent. Some people use these daily streams as a way to be held accountable. They pledge to stream between five and seven daily and work on this specific project. If someone learned something, great, but that's not the intent.

Tech can open many doors that lead to different pathways. For example, you can study and eventually apply for a job where you work for someone else, or you can create your own opportunity by starting a business. This could be a product company or an agency. No matter which of these you choose, there will be some form of an interview.

The difference is that, on the one hand, you're interviewing for a specific position at a particular company. But, on the other hand, as a business owner, you are either convincing clients why they should use your product or your service in an agency setting.

Which of the two options is most interesting, starting a business or working for a company? Then, based on your choice, is there anything about the interview process that scares you a little bit?

**Rico Smit**
Personally, I would like to start my own business. I walked out of high school into a permanent job working for about three years as a retail salesperson. After that, I got the opportunity for better hours and more pay for doing school photos. I've been working there for three years now as well. So I've been working for other people since I got out of high school.

I've reached a point where I have had enough of making someone else rich. I've got a lot of knowledge and experience with many things. I do feel that I want to start my own thing and get away from working for someone else. I have already started my business, but I'm still looking for clients. I've got one possible client pending where I still need to do this interview you're talking about.

Having about three years' worth of sales experience, the interviews are the fun part for me. I look forward to it, and it's exciting. I can definitely see the scary part of it. Having to explain to someone why to choose you. I always remember the term " fake it until you make it in sales. Should the client ask you, can you do back-end development and this whole database thing. Tell them yeah, sure. I have to research and freshen up a couple of things, but let's talk. Let's define what you need, and I'll tell you whether I can or cannot assist you. Then a client's more likely to use you if you're honest about things like that.

They won't feel you are trying to scam them out of money. You're not just someone looking for a quick buck. You're actually interested in the work.

**Schalk Neethling**
Honesty goes a long way in business. I say that knowing full well that the business industry can be a bit of a cutthroat industry. Still, I think you have to have morals for yourself and for your business. I clearly define the clients I'd be willing to work with.

And, of course, those I would not be willing to work with. And I think I shield myself a little bit from this; it's all about the money. I think it's essential to be open and honest. This specific part of the project might be a little bit more challenging, but you know, I have enough experience in how to find answers.

That's what I do I find solutions to problems. Technology is almost the easy part. Understanding the problem and defining the solution is often more challenging than writing the code. First, it's understanding what the problem is that the client's facing and how to best solve it. And only then do we ask which technology would best help me implement the solution.

Often people will come to you with a preconceived idea in their head because they've heard it from a friend. Still, it might not necessarily be the best solution for them. There might be something better that's come along since their friend built their website or product. Their friend might also benefit from your services because they might not know there's a better way. A way that could actually save them money or help grow their business faster.

I'm always excited when I hear people wanting to start their own businesses because if we look at unemployment in the world, the need for jobs is massive.

**Rico Smit**
It is.

**Schalk Neethling**
For each of us that starts our own little business and start networking with each other, we are creating opportunity for ourselves, but down the line, we're creating opportunities for others.

The nice thing about someone like yourself starting a business is, you know the pain of having to learn all of this and having to find a job where people ask:

"How much experience do you have?"

"Well, work experience in tech? None yet, but I've done all these."

"Oh no, no, no. We are looking for someone with five years of experience. Sorry."

So, you'll be more open to listening to somebody and giving them a chance. Telling them, you know what, come work for me. I'll pay you a monthly salary, and let's see how it goes. If I can see that you can do the job by the end of the month, let's just keep going.

You can even struggle, but if you're willing to learn and eager to do what's necessary to get the work done, I'm happy to employ you. The more we can get that kind of thing going, the better.

**Rico Smit**
That is something I find very difficult. I've been on many platforms, like upWork looking for jobs. I see an opportunity and look at it, and I'm like, I can do this. I can do everything you need. I have all the requirements. I've got the technology, I've got the background, I've got an internet connection. I've got all of this. I only lack the three years of experience you are looking for.

So, finding that one person that says, "Hey listen, this is your opportunity. Let's see what you can do." that's all you need. It is that one person that says I'm willing to give you a month worth of work. Let's see how you do.

Just circling back to the interviews. I do have some advice for people. I turn it around. When a client comes to me, I interview them. I get them to tell me what they need.

I ask them to tell me what they are looking for and want to do. So clients come to me with their requirements. Okay, well, I can do this for you. Some of it is very difficult and will take longer. So you will be charged more because this will take me about three or four hours instead of an hour's worth of work. With that said, there is another way we can accomplish the same goal.

So, I turn it around instead of sitting there and feeling I'm being interviewed. I ask them, what are you looking for. What do you want out of this website? Because I can say whatever I want and speak about myself for an hour and never answer any of the client's questions.

What's your question. Then I answer, what's your next question? And I answer. I then ask a question where they say something that makes me think, wait for a second; this is not how it works. We can't do it this way, but we can do it this, this, or this way. Clients love having options. So I flip the interview around, and you're interviewing them now.

Because at the end of the day, you need to know what to do from them. Ask the person, what do you want? What are you looking for? And answering what you can or cannot do feels much more straightforward than saying, I sell websites. I make websites go look over there.

Then you change it all from me, me, me to them. And you change the focus around, and the client feels very special if I can state it like that.

**Schalk Neethling**
For sure, that's excellent advice. Thank you for sharing that.

I look forward to seeing where you go and what you do with your business. So before we officially wrap it up, are there any projects you're currently working on that you would like to tell everybody about? This can be open source or side projects; it doesn't matter. You can talk about client projects or any links you want people to know about.

And, of course, we'll have them all in the show notes, but if you want to give some specific shout-outs, then go for it.

**Rico Smit**
I have a client pending where everything suggests they will use me to create their website. They work with aluminum and door frames and install them for houses around our area.

So I would love to share that journey, as you said. I would love to create a blog to share the journey of how I built it. But as of now, I still need all the information from the client. So, I haven't started yet, but I have started planning. I have started looking at designs and color schemes and stuff like that.

My only current project is my own website, which is [RWSWebDesign.co.za](https://www.rwswebdesign.co.za/). It is currently live. I have been communicating with our community, improving some stuff, changing grammar, and updating some of my graphics. And I do keep it up to date because this is my business website.

So, other than that, I don't really have any side projects. I would like to give a shout-out to [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). You actually told me about the site earlier this week. I think it's a fantastic platform so far for me to learn. They do start from the very basics, which is a bit annoying.

That said, I got about four or five lessons in, and they've already taught me something new about the basics I did not know.

So far, it feels like a fantastic site, especially for beginners. They start simple and are easy to understand. They've got excellent documentation and all of those good things.

**Schalk Neethling**
The great thing about freeCodeCamp is, well, it's free, but beyond that, it's built by a community of contributors. So one, it's kept up to date and constantly being improved. So you, that's learning; you can contribute back to that project. Even if it's just a tiny thing where you maybe find the wording of something could be made more straightforward, more understandable.

It's an open-source project. So you can fork it, open a pull request and propose something that you feel would improve the project. So I think it's great to be involved with projects like that. [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) is one of the others I'll shout out to cause I'm pretty involved with them. It's an open-source project. All the content is on GitHub. It's community written, and they have people paid to work on it. But it's a massive open-source project. So I think being involved in these projects is excellent. And there are a lot of wonderful people behind these projects that would be happy to receive pull requests.

So I can personally send an invitation to everybody listening to check out freeCodeCamp and MDN Web Docs.

**Rico Smit**
I would like to go back and donate to freeCodeCamp when my business takes off. Then, when I succeed, I would love to go back and donate to freeCodeCamp. freeCodeCamp doesn't cap their learning based on pay gates which is something I am very appreciative of.

**Schalk Neethling**
Thank you, Rico, for being the first guest on the Mycelium Network podcast. I hope this is going to be one of many we'll do.

**Rico Smit**
Thank you for having me. It's been quite an experience. Always nice to sit and speak to someone about these kinds of things. Not sitting in your mind, just thinking about all this stuff and feeling stuck. So I would recommend for shy people as well, get a community, join a community and just start speaking with people.
