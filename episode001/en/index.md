# The Mycelium Network Podcast Episode One with Rico Smit

Today, we are going to have a chat with Rico Smit. He is one of the people that joined the Mycelium Network very early on and has been pretty active on the community, so I thought it only appropriate to have him as one of the first guests.

Hey Rico, welcome to the podcast.

Hi, thanks for having me.

It's a pleasure.

So I've sent some of these questions to you beforehand, just so you can be a little bit more prepared, but we'll off the cuff some things here and there. No pressure, this is just an informal chat to learn what works, what doesn't work, and what the challenges are you're facing as an early-stage web developer.

So to get us off to a, a start tell us a bit about your background. What did you do up to now and what made you look into getting into software or web development specifically? Well, since I was born, raised here in Victoria my uncle has been very heavy into technology. So ever since I lived, I was little, I remember standing by him seeing what he is doing and they didn't treat me from a young age.

And then throughout high school, I had the opportunity to take it and actually discovered the love for coding. And I had a chance to get all of the fundamentals. But as soon as that all ended I had to basically walk out into a job. I worked in, in retail for a hardware shop that's I did what I had to, to survive, but it's not what I wanted to do.

I always had this feeling like I wanna do something else. The first course I had with you, actually, I actually realized how much I love web development above stuff like app development or server working or security stuff like that. I actually realized I really love working with web creating pages, designing new things.

I just fall in love with. That's great. So yeah, I'm looking to study now at the end of the day, I would like to be a full stack developer, being able to do everything in anything that is necessary. mm-hmm yeah. Yeah. So it's good to, I, I think it's, it's good to have that as a goal, but what I do find is like the goal they talk about a T-shaped being T-shaped in terms of your skills.

So you have a broad. Knowledge base, but then you have something that you like focus in. Like for myself personally, I do know about backend development and I've done stuff and I keep doing stuff in that region, like Python a little bit, and even databases still like the old relational kind of stuff I say, but people definitely still use relation relational databases today.

But I definitely have thet of my T shape is definitely focused on front end development. And like, as they say front of the front, so I like the design aspects. And I like the CSS and making things look good and work well and performance accessibility. Those things are really important to me. So I think it's good to have that broader perspective of, of what happens in the industry, but it's always nice to have something that.

More your focus area. You really go deep as they say that. So you have this breadth and then you have depth in a certain area. But that's great. Yeah, I know for myself also, I I also got into web development from a music background. And for me, the nice thing about web in the early days with flash and that was still around was that it had this thing where I could like take the musical aspect and the design aspect and like, Take a little bit of programming and like mix 'em all.

And cause we used to make these flash intros, which were like little movies that used to play before. You'd actually go into the website. Yeah. We like little movie with like text and animation and whatnot. And then it would say click to enter that used to be a huge thing back in the day. So yeah. So I, I understand like starting something and then being bitten by this web thing and really digging into it.

So. Is there something you wanted to expand there? I must say I am more interested in the front inside of things. It feels like I would like to know the back end part to make things simpler if you do get stuck, but I must definitely say more interested in front end development. I don't really find PHP.

Interesting. I hate SCL. We had to do some in high school. I absolutely hated it. Yeah, yeah, no, it's, it's a journey. It is for sure. So now we know about your background and how you, you came to where you are and what you're looking to do for your future. Like you mentioned, one of the main things you need to do is learn.

So as you're learning, what, which resources have you like really come to depend on? I've got. Three, actually four now. I really like the input I should get from you. We get together. I have a chat spots, things that's going on and places to find things to help the development further vs. Code has gotten very essential for me.

It is. I try it. Sublime text. It is very bare bone and feels like amazing. If you have a laptop and traveling around and you have a moment, could you open up and edit something? Mm-hmm , it's also a very, very, it's a lot smaller than vs code. So it's easier for me to carry around on a flash drive. Yeah. So having GI actually is amazing just using GitHub in general, cuz where I am, I would be able to download my current project.

I'd be able to open it and sublime and work on it. But when I'm home, I prefer to use skid up to download my updates and everything and then work through via code. And funny enough, YouTube is very essential to me. I struggle to certain read through a document of pages and pages. I just can't. So for me, I like YouTube.

Someone telling you do this, this, and this, and then they type it out. So you can actually pause and go do it yourself and then rinse and repeats until you get the hang of whatever you're doing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I agree. There's definitely different modalities that work better. For some people that is why with the 150 days of HTML thingy that I'm putting together, I have incorporated video into the pages now, so that if you are more of a video person, you can like, listen to me, talk through the content.

But you have the content just below you as a reference. I think that that for me is something that I. Understood more and more is giving people different ways to consume the same content because not everybody learns the same way. Is there anybody specifically on YouTube that you do you wanna like give a shout out to that you find is particularly good.

Now you asking me a question a half. I do know his name and particularly on a retrieve it. If I remember correctly, it's marsh and He has a lot of coding tutorials online, his entire teaching style, the way he talks explains all of the little graph and things he uses is amazing. I just really like learning this from this guy particular.

That's great. I'm trying to just get his name right now. If I remember greatly, it's a marsh sounds familiar. I think you've mentioned him to me as well. The one big problem actually running into as a new developer is finding the information I need. Yeah. Yeah. So more often than not, I'd find myself asking what's next.

I don't know what to learn from here on out. And so having a unfortunately go for. Unfortunately, I do rely on free resources at the moment because not currently is running from paycheck to paycheck. So I simply do not have the means to pay for courses quite yet. Especially the online staff gets really expensive really quickly.

Yes, that's true. There we go. I found his name. Marshani. All right. Cool. We should link him up in the send me the link afterwards and I'll put it in the, in the show notes and I'll probably reach out to him and see if I can do an interview with him on the podcast. Yeah. Now all of those things are very true and I think what's ized is something that's starting to get a little more traction is the idea of purchasing power parity pricing.

That's always a hard one to say with all the keys The idea, being that depending on where you live they will geo fence the content, but you will pay a smaller, a lower amount based on where you live. Somebody that's really great with this is somebody like Kene Dodds. He's got a, all those courses about react and testing and all that kind of stuff.

And if I living in South Africa purchases, one of these courses, I get a 60% discount immediately just because. Purchase parity pricing. So I think that's something that the industry as a whole should consider more widely cuz then they can make it. Cause I, because I understand why people lost money for courses, it's they heck up a lot of work.

And if you wanna do it well, it's especially a lot of work and you know, if take for some people, this is, this. How they make a living, but it, it is tough when you, when you come from a third world country or you're just starting out and you're still finding your feet and you don't have a bunch of money to invest yet.

It is hard and there's all kinds of other interesting things developing around that idea as well. But some academies and stuff for the United States exploring a different way of paying for, for your courses. But that is definitely, I think the thing that I get from you is. One big thing that's missing is a roadmap that you can look at, which points you at specific learning material based on where you are along your path, and also which path you're you're on.

Are you on a back end path or you on a full stack path or you're more on a front end path? Cause you will have different milestones and different learning material needs there. So I think that is something that. We should look into see how there are some resources to help there. Yeah, no, definitely.

Cuz being in the front end, developing I've been working, learning, and then I reach a point and just look at everything online. What now do I just invest my time into Cassas do I just continue HTML, Java? What next? What do I need to do? What do I need to find? So I end up spending two to three hours searching for staff to.

Running out of steam learning for an hour or two, and then continuing with my day, rather than having to go somewhere and spend those hours more an hour finding this and this, and this is what I need. And then two to three hours of learning, whatever. Need to come next. Yeah. Yeah. I think I, I think communities such as my stadium network can also help there if we, especially, if we can get some more mentors to join our, this code server and then.

We're talking about the idea of having some meetups virtually and in person where possible I think that'll help because there you can pose these kind of questions and, you know, talk with other people. And often more often than not somebody else has been where you are and they can say, oh, I actually found this thing and it can kind of help you on your way.

So I think Investing in community and joining in, on these communities and being active, I think is one of the ways that we can, we can start solving this roadmap problem, but we have to get people from that are learning and people who are teaching in the same place. Yeah. A nice mixture of two. So you don't have too many mentors and too little, so.

Yeah, definitely. And it's. I's quite a shy guy. It was very difficult for me to enter the community. Yes. I dunno why I've always had this thing about online communities, even during my leisurely hours and a half gaming and stuff. I would not communicate with both people in the server. I just find it strange.

You can say. So that was quite difficult for me, but what I found is you just jump. Find one thing you like just drop a comment and see what happens. Yeah. Cause after that first comment you find it's actually not that intimidating or scary, you can just. Yeah, that's very true. And a lot of that comes down to also the people running the community, right.

If, if you are, if you are focused and you start off with good community guidelines and you clearly enforce them, it helps a lot. Because there are, you know, bubbles out there that just wanna come and, you know, sour the pot. But as, as long as. People that have their finger on the pulse and can quickly pick that up and make sure that those people are either kicked or reprimanded in a way that they understand it, that kind of behavior is not welcome.

And their continued participation is going to hinge very heavily on them, changing their attitude. I think that is important. And it's something that unfortunately has been a little rough on the internet to put it mildly. Places got very toxic very quickly. And for me and you, it might be a little bit easier than for some genders and people of different races and ethnicities for them, it's even harder to really feel comfortable in these groups.

So, you know, big challenges that we have, but as long as we acknowledge them and at least we're in the right direction, I think you've, you've mentioned a lot of. You've touched on a lot of the stuff from this, the next question I had in mind, but I'm gonna pose it anyway, just in case there's anything else.

So having talked about all of these resources and stuff so clearly there's a bunch of things that don't work, but there are things that work, but if there's anything else that you feel on that doesn't work so great side that you wanna highlight the work, the not work. So great is a bit difficult. It does not work so great.

The only thing I'm I am personally really stuck on is feeling lost. You there's drop that falls into an ocean. You're just gonna du swim. You dunno where you're going. You don't know which way you don't know if you should swim down or up or what's going, on's the only thing that's really missing for me.

But that said, I do have you as a mentor, as. So I don't feel that lost. If I get stuck, I can meet up and just say, Hey, listen, this is going on. How can we resolve this? Mm mm mm. Yeah. So clearly that that's an important thing to, to have and to nurture is this whole. Mentor relationship. Cause I do think that there's a lot of value there.

That's that? I think a lot of people miss. Yeah. That's what about to say? That's definitely something that's missing is finding someone you can ask a question to, to just ask how do you had a heading in the HTML and not him having a laugh at you and just saying, oh, okay, let's help you. Yeah, this is how we do it.

This is why we do it. But I did not feel that personally, cuz I did start my journey with you. So I had that from the get go, but I can really see that being missing in a lot of people's startup. You can half off. Same. Yeah. Yeah, I know for sure. That's true. I, I mean, I I've been there also, and I know that I, I actually searched widely to try and find, is there any like networks or mentorship programs or anything like that, that, that you can join and that there are some now to be honest that I, I should probably mention.

On on, I'll put some of that link to some of them in the show notes. Some stuff like outreach is really, really great. And they also focus on being very inclusive. So, you know, it it's outreach does some amazing work. And there are some other mentorship programs as well, but unfortunately some of the mentorship things, again comes with a cost, which is understandable.

But again, if you're not. If you're not in a position to be able to pay it is just another roadblock you have to face. And, you know even though web development specifically, that's what I can talk to mostly. I've come a heck of a long way since the day was when I started. And a lot of things that used to be super hard are now trivially simple.

It's still not easy. There's still a lot of questions that, that one has. So, you know, the need for that still exists very much. No, it definitely does. As for the roadblock of the payment. I have looked into teaching myself it in general. So startup courses for old people or a woman, especially in my area, I don't really know how computers work.

That was a big thing for me. A lot of female older women don't know in the area. So I was looking to make something for them to teaching how computers work. And I completely understand why you charge so much for a course. It's a lot of hard work. It's a lot of information gathering and this and that. And you need to remember this.

And even once I was ready to start, I still felt like I still have to go through a couple of things and make sure, yeah. So I can totally understand why, but not having the funds necessarily available. Pay, let's say $60 for advanced course. You no will help you. It's quite a hindrance cuz now I have to go search.

How can I get this information for. . Yeah. Yeah, no, no, for sure. No, I completely get that. And the, the other thing with course is of course, is that you have to, especially if you're asking money is you have to keep it up to date. It's not a, it's not something you make and then forget about because you know, the tech industry.

Evolves and moves quite fast. so, you know, that that's the other part is if, if you want to keep it if you want it to be useful, you have to keep it up to date. That is something as well. Cuz I was following books from Microsoft. I was lucky enough to get access to those books and. They fall into that trap.

I would learn and learn and learn and learn it to some point. And I'll hit a roadblock, just being what's this it's not working, what's going on. And I have to go search for hours and hours and hours just to find out this phrase is no longer valid, simply change X to Y. And it works. Yeah. So that is definitely a befall.

I can see some people falling into not keeping everything up to date. And it is frustrating me again for us. Who's new at learning these things cuz now where you would know this or no, where to look for it. I need to spend two or three hours trying to find out why is it not working? What's going on?

What's this error. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But teeing off the thing where you said you were looking at creating some courses to teach people other skills that you already have. I think in general, that is a good idea. And that's something that a lot of people knew to your development. This doesn't matter what industry it is are a little bit scared of, but that I would personally encourage is to write about the stuff that you learn.

because yeah, teaching is one of the best ways of learning. So if you've, if you've bolt something, anything like write about. Write about how you made it doesn't necessarily have to tell a story per se, about the struggles you had. It cannot really just be you writing down how to make a responsive Euro with HDML and CSAs.

Because by doing that, you are thinking through the, the process of having done that. Oftentimes you find ways that you can do it even better than what you've already done it. So. Automatically improve your existing code base. And at the end of the day, you have a piece of writing that can also be useful for whether you start a business or whether you are looking for employment.

You have something to point people to, to say, not only did I make this thing, but I wrote about how I did it, cuz there's not a lot of people that can do both of those things. A lot of people are really good at writing the software, but they're not so good at teaching it. And, and more often than not, it's not.

They don't have the skills. They just never exercise that skill. So as they exercise their coding skill, they don't exercise writing about their coding. And so that kind of never develops. So you have this amazing software engineer, but if you tries to explain something to you, it's like food right over your head because they never go back and think about how did I, what did I do before I knew how to do this?

How did I. To that point. What was the things that I, what were the things I did wrong and how did I find a better way and stuff like that. So I think while you're learning, writing about the stuff that you make is incredibly important, you just gave me a great idea to maybe branch off of my existing URL to start something just called R a.

Yeah, just a, just a place we can write. I made a navigation bar today. Mm-hmm by using this, this and this, I hit this roadblock, but I found this information there. Yeah. So if someone does read it, they can say that's my problem. So I can just go look over there to go fix it. Yeah. There's something I hit a hard road block with is including Jason into my project.

Cause everyone was thinking, oh no, just add it. Just install it. Just do it. Like, yeah. How, how do I do this? yeah. And off like two or three hours, I was like, oh, I just make a text file. Change the name and paste the stuff in and included into my job and bam, Bob uncle. But then again, that, just that little bit of knowledge, I couldn't find for about two to three hours.

Cause everyone just explains how to use it, not how to implement it. Ah gotcha. Gotcha. And it, and, and it's literally because people just don't think that far back anymore for them using J is just. Thing you do, like it's just text. What are you, what are you talking about? But it's like, no, but if you Don know, if you don't know what Jason is and how it fits into the larger framework of building a let's take, for example, the one tool that I build developer tool chest.

All that is in the end of the day is a website that loads some JS that has a specific structure and it loops through them. And for each entry, it makes little block based on the search filter that you typed in. But if you don't know how JS fits into that whole thing, it can be like, wait, What is this?

Jason? No. Is it a database it's like, kind of, yeah, but not really. So, you know, it's, it's understanding that no, Jason is just a flight text file that has certain limitations placed upon it. And J in the end is data. So this is like the data part of your project. You describe data inside your J document, and then you can consume it as if it's like a data.

Kind of just a very, very loose database. Like I dunno if you've ever looked up a sequel light, but if you. If you haven't doesn't matter just maybe after the podcast, just have a search for SQL light and SQL light is essentially just a flat text file on your hard drive that it acts as a database, but you can query the data as if it's sequel.

That's why SQL light. And like it's in everything. It's in everything like your mobile phone. You're everything. It's everywhere. SQL is like everywhere. okay. I already opened a tab over after we are done. So that's, that's one of those great read and that also reminded me. That's something I see a lot of mentors fall, I wanna say full short, but I know if that's the right word.

That's why I like following much. He says, use an H one tag to add a title. And a lot of people just move on. But for me personally, I wanna know why, what does it do? How does it work? And what he does is pulls up a look, graph and tells you H one does this, it adds a title. It does this, this is how you use it.

This is how you can use it. So that is something I've been struggling with as well. Cuz I've been following someone doing a text adventure game, cuz that was interesting to me. This guy would just type no use this there's this enter and go to the next thing. I'm like, wait, why, why did he do this? How does this work?

He didn't explain to me anything. He just wrote code on a little bad and moved on. So he didn't actually teach me anything. You just showed me what he can do. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess there's a place for that, but I think. More often than not. You find that a lot on Twitch. Like a lot of people on Twitch would stream them working.

The idea is not to, you might pick up some stuff by watching, but that's not their intent. Their intent is just like I'm doing some stuff and maybe I want to be held accountable. And therefore I will stream every day between five and seven and I'll work on this specific project. It's more a way of keeping themselves accountable.

And if somebody learned something out of it then great, but that's not the intent, but yeah, that's, it's all good stuff. So I'm wondering So looking towards the future then I'm gonna, I'm gonna, it was two separate questions, but I think I'm gonna throw it into one question. Okay. So you can do one or two things like you can learn and learn and learn and eventually apply for a job.

And work for somebody else, or you can do the other thing, which is create your own opportunity by starting your own business, whether that is building a product or by starting an agency where you create websites and design for, for other people. But I think in both of those areas, it doesn't really matter which one you choose this idea of an interview.

As part of both the difference being on the one hand you're interviewing for a specific position at a specific company. The other one you're being interviewed by a client who wants to know that if I give you money, I'll get a website in return. So therefore I need to. You know, I'm just not blindly gonna give you money.

I want you to speak to you a little bit and it's also a kind of an I to do. Yeah. So my question is which one of the two is of most interest to you, like starting a business or working for somebody. And based on that, what is the things about these interviews that perhaps scare you a little bit? Okay.

Personally, I would like to start my own business. I walked out of high school, into my permanent job working for about three years as a retail salesperson. And after that I got the opportunity for better hours more pay doing school photos. So I've been working there for three years now as well. So I've been basically working since I got out of high.

And I've reached a point where I'm had enough of making someone else rich. I've got a lot of knowledge. I've got a lot of experience with a lot of things. I do feel like I wanna start my own thing and I wanna get away from working for someone else. Wanna start my own business. I wanna start doing my own thing, which I already have started.

I'm still looking for clients now. I've got one line bending. We still need to do this interview. You're talking about. Yeah, yeah. But having about three years worth of sales experience, the interviews are fun part for me. I look forward to it and it's exciting and it's, I can definitely see the scary bit of it having to explain to someone why to use you.

But what I always find in sales is if you use the term, fakely make it. You can sell a pen to a pin factory. If you stand with a smile and they'll ask you, can you do backend development and do this whole database thing and tell 'em? Yeah, sure. I do have to do some research. I do need to freshen up on a couple of things, but let's talk, let's see what you can do and I'll tell you yes or no, I can or cannot assist you then a client more, more likely to use you.

If you're honest about things like that. Cause they don't feel you're trying to scam out of money. They do feel like. Okay. Yeah, I do know what I'm doing. I just need to sharpen up. So then I already feel like, oh, okay. So you're not just someone making, looking for a quick buck. You're actually interested in the work.

Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Honesty goes a long way in business. That's for sure. And I mean, I say that knowing full well that the business industry can be a bit of a cutthroat industry as well, but I think Do you have to have morals for yourself and for your business. And like me personally, for me as well, I, I, I have very fine lines of the type of clients I'd be willing to work with.

And once I wouldn't be willing to work with, and I think there, I shield myself a little bit from this cutthroat it, like it would, it's all about the money kind of thing. Yeah. I think it's great. I think it's great. To be honest and open that Sure I can do this. This specific part of the project might be a little bit more challenging, but you know, I have enough experience in how to find answers.

That's what I do is I find solutions to problems. The technology is almost kind of the easy part. Finding the mentally, finding a solution is. Lots of times harder than actually writing the code. It's understanding what is the problem that the client's facing? How do I best solve this? And then what technology do I need to employ in order to solve this?

Because oftentimes people will come to you with a preconceived idea in their head because they've heard it from a friend, but it might not necessarily be the best solution for them. There might be something better. That's come along since their friend did their thing. Their friend might actually also benefit from your services and because they might not know that there's a better way to do this now that could actually save the money or, you know, help them grow their business faster.

Thanks. I'm always excited when I hear people wanting to start their own businesses because. If we look at unemployment in the world, the need for jobs is massive. And it is for all for each of us that starts our own little business and start networking with each other. We are creating opportunity for ourselves, but down the line, we're creating opportunities for others.

And the nice thing about. Somebody like yourself. For example, starting a business is, you know, the pain of having to learn this stuff and having to find a job where people say, oh, how much experience do you have? While working experience? Not yet, but I've done all these. Oh no, no, no. We are looking for something with five years experience.

Sorry. Yeah. So you'll be more open to listening to somebody and giving them a chance and telling them, you know what, come work. Let I'll pay you a full salary for a month. And let's see how it goes. Yeah. If by the end of the month, I can see that you can do the job, Bob, your uncle, and let's just keep going.

Yeah, but if I find that after a month that you can even struggle, but if you're willing to learn and you're willing to do, what's necessary to get the work done, I'm happy to, to employ you. I think the motive we can get that, that kind of thing going better. Yeah, in that sense. That is something I find very difficult.

I've been on a lot of platforms, like work and so on looking for jobs and I find stuff and I look at it, I'm like, I can do this. I can do everything you need. I have all the requirements. I've got the technology, I've got the background, I've got internet connection. I've got all of this. The only thing I'm lacking is the three years of experience.

I must have. You are looking. Yeah. And finding that one person that says, Hey, listen, this is your opportunity. Just try, let's see what you can do. That's all you need. That's all you need. Is that one guy that just says I'm willing to give you a month worth of work. Let's see what you're doing. How are you doing?

How you're handling this? Yeah. On a little bit of a side, tangent, the interview, just circling back to the interviews. I do have some advice for people. I turn it around. I have a client comes to me, I'm they? They can just find my wording. I am interviewing them. Okay. I get them to tell me what they need.

I get to tell them what they get them to tell me what they are looking for, what they are looking to do. So they'll come to me, sound three pages. I want this time. I want that time on this day to me, like, okay, well this I can do. This I can do for you. It's very difficult. It takes long. So you are gonna be charged more for this cuz instead of just a quick, quick hours worth of work, this can take me about three or four hours, but I can do it another way for you.

So instead of sitting there and wondering like I'm, I'm being interviewed, I turn it around. I ask them, what are you looking. What do you want? What do you want out of this website? Cause obviously I can say whatever I want and I might just go off on a site engine for an hour, speaking about myself and what I did not answering any questions where a fatal work client.

What's your question. Then I answer, what's your next question? And I answer and you ask a question. I say something you're like wait a second. This is not how it works. We can't do it this way. We can do it this way, this way or this way. Clients love having options. Yeah. So it's you pretty much flip the interview around and you're interviewing them now.

Cause at the end of the day, you do need to know from them what you need to do. Oh yes. Having that person just ask you the entire time. What do you want? What are you looking for? Yes, I can do this for you. No, I cannot do this for you. Feels a lot easier than I sell websites. I make websites go look over there.

I can make a navigation bar. I can it. Then you change it all from me, me, me to them. And you change the focus point around on them and they feel very special if I can state it like that. Yeah, no for sure. No, that's that's great advice. Yeah. Thanks for sharing that. This was really cool. I really enjoyed this.

I'm looking forward to seeing where you go and what you do with, with your business. So before we officially wrap it up is there any projects you're currently working on that you like. To tell everybody about this can be open source, can be site projects, doesn't matter, client projects that you can talk about or any like links that you'd like people to, to know about.

And of course we'll have them all also in the show notes, but if you wanted to give some specific shoutouts, then go for it. Not quite at the moment. I do have a client outstanding that it is going, everything points are gonna use me to create their website. They do work with aluminum and door frames and they install them for different houses all around our area yeah.

In Victoria. So I will love to share that journey. Like you said, I would love to make a blog for a journey of how it will create that. But as of now, Still need all the information. So I haven't started yet, but I have started planning. I have started looking at designs and color schemes and stuff like that.

The only current project I do have is my own website, which is RS web design.co. It is currently live. I have been communicating with our community, improving some stuff, changing grammar, updating some of my graphics. And I do keep it up to date, cuz this will be my private business website from that's just, just repeat that, that URL for us.

That's R ass web design. Do. Okay. R a swipe designed or te data, get, check it out, folks. So other than that, the site projects I don't really have at the moment I would like to give a shout out to free code camp.org. You actually gave me the site a bit earlier this week. I think mm-hmm, , mm-hmm, , it's an amazing platform so far for me to learn, they do start from the very basics, which is a bit annoying.

They got about four or five exercises in and they've already taught me something new of the basics. I didn't. That's great. So, so far it feels like an amazing tutorial, especially for beginners to start at, cuz they start simple, easy to understand they've got documentations and all of that good things.

Yeah. And the great thing about Preco camp is, well, it's free, but beyond that, it's, it's built by a community of contributors. So one it's kept up to date constantly being improved and you yourself, like Preco, that's learning, you can contribute back to that project, even if it's just a small thing where you maybe find the wording of something, not as understandable as you'd like to be.

It's an open source project. You. For it, open a pool request and propose something that you feel would improve it. So I think it's a really great to be involved with projects like that. MDN is one of the other ones that I'll give a shout out to cause I'm quite involved with them that that is in the same vein.

It's an open source project. All the content is right there. It's community written and they have, there are some people paid to work on it. But it's, it's a massive business project. So I think being involved in these projects is great. And there's a lot of wonderful people behind these projects that would be happy to, to receive poor requests.

So I can like personally send an invitation to everybody listening to. Both go check out FCO camp and MDN web docs on get up and on the web and learn, contribute. It's all good. It's all a learning experience. So, yeah. Thanks for sharing that. Yeah. So yeah, no there is something I would like to go back and I should donate to free camp free code camp if not if.

My business takes off. Yes. When I become a success, I would love to go back and actually donate to them. And that is something I am very appreciative of them. They don't cap their learning based on. Value gates, you do all busy working and it pops up like, Hey, listen, would you like to donate? I just look at Shane.

Like, no, not now. maybe, maybe once my first side takes off and I've made my first sale. I'll come back and I'll come donate some few. Yeah, I've totally done that. I've totally done that with a couple of opensource things where it's been. Just like, I wouldn't be where I am without it. And so now that I am where I am, I totally just go and do a monthly, like set up a monthly donation because I wanted to be around for the next generation and I wanted to keep improving.

So yeah, I think that's great that, that, that you're also already preparing yourself for doing that. It's great stuff. Well, thanks Rico. It was really great. Thanks for being the first guest on the, my CDM network podcast. I hope this is gonna be one of many, many, many, and we'll do one again once once your business is huge and you've got like hundreds of employees, no, it's been great.

Thank you for having me. It's been quite an experience, always nice to sit and speak to someone about these kind of things. Yeah. Not just sitting in your own mind, just thinking about all of this stuff and just feeling stuck. So I would actually recommend for shy people as well, get a community, join a community and just start speaking with people.

It really, yes. Lightens the load if you say it like that. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. It's been quite a patient. Same for me. Have a good rest of your evening. And I'll speak to you on the community. Have a good one will do you too. Bye bye.
