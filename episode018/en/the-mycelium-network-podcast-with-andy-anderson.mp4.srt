Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey Andy, thanks so much for joining me for the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,440
Well, thanks for having me.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,640
I'm really happy to be able to do this.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Yeah, I'm really glad you agreed to do it because I know I had to convince you a little

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
bit.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,560
I definitely am an introvert and I don't really like the limelight.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,040
Yeah, no, me too.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,760
And I've said it before, I don't know why I keep putting myself in situations that generally

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,240
I shouldn't enjoy.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,760
Maybe I'm trying to force myself out of the situation.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,920
But I do enjoy a good conversation, so I think that's more what it's about.

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,320
And so I think what I'm interested in a couple of things, and I sent you some notes, but

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,120
I think one of the things with you that is unique from anybody else that I've had a conversation

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,560
with so far is you have a really long history in tech.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,000
And I think there's a lot of really interesting things that you can share.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,160
And I'm also curious for us to kind of juxtapose when you started and now where you've kind

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,040
of like trying to get back into the world of tech, but in MLDB a different industry

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,160
than you were and how things have changed, what's gotten better, what's gotten worse,

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,920
what's stayed the same.

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,560
So I think before we dive into any specific topic, if you can kind of give us a bit of

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,680
a background of who you are, where you are today, and some of the history.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Yeah, well, my childhood was really pretty standard and unremarkable, but I was always

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:09,920
interested in science and mathematics and tinkering with gadgets and electronics and

26
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,080
I mean those things always fascinated me.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:26,720
So when I got to college, computers hadn't really become an area of study yet.

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,680
And I kind of had two college careers.

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,600
I went for a couple of years right out of high school and couldn't really decide what

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
to do.

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Nothing really seemed interesting.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,880
I couldn't get excited about any of the subjects.

33
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,720
So I quit and actually worked in a factory for a couple of years driving a forklift.

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,480
After about a year of that, I thought, well, I don't really want to be doing this when

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm 50.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,600
So I thought it's probably a good idea to maybe go back to college and find something

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:07,860
that I could be interested in that would be a little bit more fun career.

38
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:15,560
So I transferred, got back into college as a junior.

39
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,040
And the way I got into computing is a little bit different.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,520
It wasn't really something that was on my radar, but I was actually majoring in chemistry.

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,440
I'd always liked chemistry and school and everything.

42
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,280
So I was majoring in chemistry and there was one quarter that I needed a chemistry class

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,020
that wasn't being offered.

44
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,720
And so I needed something to fill out my schedule and went to talk to my advisor.

45
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,800
And I said, I need to have a full load, full schedule, because I don't want to waste any

46
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
time.

47
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,240
And he said, well, you might want to take this FORTRAN course.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:05,880
He said, it'll fit into a Bachelor of Science degree really well.

49
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,280
And I still remember exactly what he said.

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,560
He said to me, computers probably aren't going to go away.

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,800
And so I thought, well, I still wasn't totally convinced.

52
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,480
So I did go and sign up for the course.

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,560
I went to the first day of class.

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,120
The professor seemed like a pretty nice guy.

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,960
It was a large class, introductory to FORTRAN.

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,080
I did not buy the book right away because I wasn't sure I was going to keep the class.

57
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,880
So the first day of class went pretty well.

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,760
So after the second day of class, I actually went and bought the book.

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,400
I still have the book somewhere.

60
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,960
It's one of the boxes that have followed me around.

61
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,120
And after the third day of class, I went to the administration building, changed my major

62
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,840
to computer science, and the rest is history, as they say.

63
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:13,000
But when I started doing computer science in college, we were using punch cards instead

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
of terminals.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
So I had to go to the bookstore and buy.

66
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,920
They had vending machines, actually, in the computing center, where you could buy a package

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,680
of 100 punch cards for like a dollar or something.

68
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:36,440
And for my first course, I think I probably got most of them out of the vending machine.

69
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,760
But pretty soon after the second or third course, I thought, well, it'll be just easier

70
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,240
and cheaper to go to the bookstore and start buying them in the big boxes of 1,000 cards

71
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,080
in it, so that's what I did.

72
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,040
And not too long after that, then they did install some terminals and they set up a machine

73
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:03,640
to do time sharing of the IBM 370, which everything ran on.

74
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:12,400
So from punch cards to today is just a stark difference.

75
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,880
You can't even imagine what that difference is like unless you were there and lived it.

76
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,440
And I'll give you an example of what was really one of the things that's really different

77
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,240
today from punch cards.

78
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:35,520
We had what were called IBM 029 card punch machines, and you would put a deck of cards

79
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,480
in the machine and had a hopper that would feed one card at a time.

80
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,520
You tap the return key to get to bring the first card into the machine where you start

81
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,800
punching it.

82
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,020
And as you touch the keys, it actually punched the holes in the card.

83
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,200
So there was no such thing as a delete.

84
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,960
I mean, there was no backspace.

85
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:06,840
Once you hit the key, the hole was in the card, and if you had made a mistake, you just

86
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,280
push return through that card away and start it again.

87
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:18,800
So if you stood in the card punch room and listened a little bit, you could tell how

88
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,560
far into the card each person was because at the beginning of a card, you'd be typing

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,240
pretty quickly.

90
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,880
But as you got to about 40 or 50 characters in, people would slow way down because they

91
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,120
didn't want to make a mistake after having done 40 or 50 or 55 characters.

92
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,160
And today, of course, I absolutely rely on the backspace key.

93
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,760
If we didn't have backspace key, I'd have to do something else.

94
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:55,920
I type okay, but I'm not as accurate as I would like to be.

95
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:03,360
So if it wasn't for backspace, I would be much less productive in programming.

96
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,280
But another of the really big differences, I of course started with Fortran, and in school

97
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:22,880
I did Fortran, COBOL, IBM 360 and 370 assembly language, a little bit of Pascal, but not

98
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:30,720
very much, and Ada wasn't really on the horizon yet, and Java hadn't even been conceived of,

99
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:38,000
so never dealt with that in school.

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,640
And I'm not sure how familiar you are with Fortran, but in Fortran especially, we were

101
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:57,880
mostly using Fortran 66, which was the 1966 standard, and the first five spaces on a line

102
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,920
were the line number, and you didn't have to have a line number, but that's where they

103
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,720
went if you had one.

104
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,040
The sixth column was the continuation column.

105
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,360
Any character in that meant that this line was a continuation from the previous line,

106
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,320
and everything started in column seven, and you just had to remember that.

107
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:26,360
There also was no integrated development environment or language-sensitive editors or any of that.

108
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
I mean, you just had to know that.

109
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:40,680
And so the tools today are so much better and so friendly to, I think, especially new

110
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,520
developers learning a new language or new developers using something like VS Code, and

111
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:55,680
you install the plug-in that, you know, when you start typing the name of a function or

112
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,640
something like that, it basically will show you a list of what could go next, and so you

113
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:09,480
don't really even have to remember all of the names of everything, which is helpful,

114
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
I think, to everybody.

115
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,160
It is certainly for me because, you know, there's just so many more things available

116
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,400
today than there were back then.

117
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:28,840
In my professional life, I used DEC VAX computers, for the most part, and, you know, using the

118
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:38,000
VT100 or equivalent terminals, and, you know, of course, we never used punch cards for when

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,240
I was working for PAY, but I got pretty good with the editors on the VT100.

120
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,360
They had the keypad editing, which was great, but, you know, even that could not hold a

121
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,400
candle to the modern IDEs.

122
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:02,360
I mean, you know, VS Code or the JetBrains tools or things like Eclipse or I think there's

123
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,360
what's called NetBeans I used many years ago.

124
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,040
They all are just great.

125
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,360
The languages also being more available, when I first got out of school, of course, I was

126
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,360
working eight hours a day, and then I had a computer at home and I'd come home and spend

127
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,120
all day working, get a computer, come home, grab something to eat, and then spend three

128
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,900
or four or five hours at night also working on a computer, but, you know, if you wanted

129
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:41,080
to buy a compiler or assembler, I mean, they were, you know, a few hundred dollars each

130
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:48,180
and the tools were either non-existent or very expensive, so today with, you know, things

131
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:55,420
like VS Code being basically free, you can download Visual Studio if you're using it

132
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,400
for an open source project or a personal project.

133
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
You don't have to pay for that.

134
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,360
If you're trying to learn, that's great because you can learn it without spending too much

135
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
money.

136
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,360
No, JS, you just download, Python, you just download.

137
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,280
So the availability and quality of the tools is really one of the stark contrasts between

138
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,200
now and, say, the mid- to late-1980s.

139
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:34,760
I'm trying to think what else comes to mind that's, you know, that's a big contrast.

140
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:43,200
I mean, I think computers, of course, have gotten much faster.

141
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Go ahead.

142
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:53,520
Yeah, no, no, no, I was just thinking, like, where you mentioned the fact that in modern

143
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:02,040
code editors, if you start typing, it'll show you a list of potential functions that's applicable

144
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
even to the specific.

145
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,040
It can detect what kind of object you have on the left-hand side, so it'll only suggest

146
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,600
functions that's actually available on that.

147
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,960
Like if it's an array, it won't suggest something that's only available on a string and that

148
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
kind of thing.

149
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,720
So even that, like they're calling IntelliSense.

150
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,760
But then over and above that, like more often than not, when you hover over one of these

151
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,280
specific function calls or whatever, it'll show you, like, integrated documentation that's

152
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,640
like usually pulled from MDN or something.

153
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,840
So even that's being brought into the editor.

154
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,800
And then I'm wondering, like, this next evolution where you get stuff like GitHub's copilot

155
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,400
where it sometimes suggests, like, here's potentially the entire function that you probably

156
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,640
want to write based on code analysis.

157
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,120
What do you think about that coming into, like, it's almost like a pair programmer that's

158
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,960
based on machine learning?

159
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,320
I have not experienced that yet.

160
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,160
I've read a little bit about it.

161
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,400
That to me also, you know, a few years ago they were talking about AIs beginning to write

162
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,200
code and, you know, they were going to be so much more efficient and effective than

163
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
human programmers.

164
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,040
But, you know, that hasn't really come to fruition.

165
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:33,800
So I guess I'm a little skeptical that that's really going to come about and be a major

166
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,240
factor.

167
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,760
One of the things that they've also has been kind of in and out of the news over the past

168
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:51,280
30, 35 years is this, you know, idea that we're going to have these libraries of reusable

169
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:59,840
components and to build a system, you just grab some components, you know, write a little

170
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,560
bit of interface code, you know, stick them together or ship them out the door.

171
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,000
And we haven't gotten there yet either.

172
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:18,080
And to me, I think the reason that that hasn't worked is because when humans solve problems,

173
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:26,460
we don't always necessarily do it in a strictly procedural way by following a certain sequence

174
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,800
of steps.

175
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:37,560
We'll use intuition, which I don't know how you would teach a machine to have intuition.

176
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
We use experience.

177
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,240
You know, what has worked or not worked before?

178
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,440
You know, we use the knowledge that we've gained and one of the things that I've always

179
00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:01,560
found interesting when I've had the need or the situation where I needed to use recursion,

180
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,640
and I've written several functions in C that were recursive.

181
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,440
And when you need a recursive function, almost nothing else will do because you think of

182
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,960
writing this 15 or 20 line function that since it can call itself, you know, you don't need

183
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
to write too much more.

184
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:26,520
But if you had to write it out procedurally and do it, you know, calling a function and

185
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:34,760
calling another, you know, you'd get, it would be very untenable pretty quickly.

186
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,680
So how, you know, and how do you know when you should use recursion?

187
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,800
Well, it's one of those things where you're trying to solve a problem, you're trying to

188
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,120
solve a problem, and then you think, you know, this probably lends itself to a recursive

189
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,040
function.

190
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,720
And then you start looking at a little bit more and you start writing the recursive function

191
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:05,120
and yeah, and maybe 10 or 15 or 20 lines of code, you've got this function that does this

192
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,600
thing that you can't really keep in your mind because you can't iterate as deeply in your

193
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:17,120
brain and keep everything straight as the computer can pushing stuff on the stack and,

194
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,000
you know, just iterating and getting deeper and deeper.

195
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,320
And one of the things that I've always been surprised at when I've written recursive functions

196
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:34,000
is I never knew that I was almost done until I was done.

197
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,600
Because I'd be writing along and it'd be kind of working and calling itself and I'd be using

198
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,360
the debugger to watch it.

199
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,000
And then all of a sudden I'd realize, oh, that's it, and it's finished, you know, and

200
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
now it works.

201
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,360
And you know, I just, I never really knew when I was approaching that point, whereas

202
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,600
with other, with procedural type functions, you know, you pretty much knew, you know,

203
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,920
when you were almost done with the function, you just had a few more things to do and you

204
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,000
could move on and work on something else.

205
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,800
So it's fun, but I don't, I just, I don't know how you get a machine to do that or how

206
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:24,280
you create a set of components that you can pick from and without really studying it and

207
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,440
getting into it, you know that you need a recursive component rather than just some

208
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,800
procedural component.

209
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:38,000
And that's another thing that's changed since I first started getting into computing is,

210
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,760
you know, nobody had ever heard about object-oriented programming when I first started.

211
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,840
So everything was very procedural, very functional, you know, you wrote functions or subroutines

212
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:59,800
and Fortran and called them and, you know, you pushed arguments on the stack.

213
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,640
So there wasn't really this concept of an object that you were working with.

214
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,880
It was all basically arrays.

215
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:16,160
And then in C, of course, C introduced the concept of the structures and the, what do

216
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,920
they call them, where it could, it's been so long since I've written any C. There was

217
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:34,080
a way to have an area in memory that if you addressed it one way, it was like one set

218
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,040
of variables or one record format.

219
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:44,360
Or if you called it by another name, it was a, I think it was a joint or join or let's

220
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,680
join as a database thing.

221
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,240
But you could, but depending on which name you called it by, you could use a separate

222
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,840
set of variables within the same memory or region of memory.

223
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,360
And that was great if you were reading records from a text file and you didn't know what

224
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,960
the next record was going to be, you know what the different formats were.

225
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,240
So you had five or six different possible record types and you'd read the record in,

226
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,200
but you didn't know what type it was until you looked at the first four bytes and you

227
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,120
say, oh, this is a, you know, this is a certain type of record.

228
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,720
And so you would say, well, that's going to be, I'm going to call that, you know, A or

229
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,920
whatever.

230
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,200
And it would, then you'd use that until you get to the next record and it might be a different

231
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
type.

232
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,920
And I wish I could remember what the name of that was.

233
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,400
I'll look it up later and send you a message so that you can, maybe you can go back and

234
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,360
edit it in or something.

235
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,640
But object-oriented programming, and it took me a long time to get comfortable with objects

236
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:06,280
because having grown up and learned in a very functional procedural manner, wrapping my

237
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,520
brain around objects took a while.

238
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:20,800
And by a while, I mean, probably a few years at least, because it just, I guess, you know,

239
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,120
like everything else in life, you know, we have a resistance to change.

240
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,000
So I wanted to do things the way I knew how to do with them.

241
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,160
I didn't want to change to this new thing.

242
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,960
But then I finally did see the light and I woke up one day and thought, yeah, this isn't

243
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
so bad.

244
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,760
Maybe I'll, maybe I'll try this after all.

245
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,560
But those are, I think that the availability and quality of the tools, especially like

246
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,320
you mentioned, you know, the context-sensitive editors where it can tell you what the function

247
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,400
name could be or whatever.

248
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,040
And object-oriented programming is different.

249
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,160
And a year or two ago, I heard some people talking about this new thing called functional

250
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,440
programming where they, you know, they were using subroutines and functions and I thought,

251
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,800
yes, that's not new.

252
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
That's the old way.

253
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
So that was kind of interesting.

254
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Yeah, that's pretty popular in the JavaScript world.

255
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:30,220
I know a lot of people are suggesting that that might be better than, because, I mean,

256
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:36,340
you can fake object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

257
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:42,080
And to some extent, I mean, JavaScript technically has class syntax, but it's not true class

258
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,840
syntax, you know, in the Java sense, for example.

259
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,880
But through that, you can sort of create this idea of classes and inheritance and all these

260
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,120
kinds of things.

261
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:04,200
And more so if you go for something like TypeScript, then you can probably get closer to true object-oriented.

262
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,280
But I do find that a lot of folks are leaning more towards functional programming and there's

263
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:18,400
some stuff built into JavaScript that lends itself to that, like your MapReduce filters,

264
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,560
functions that you have on arrays, so you're not actually changing the underlying array.

265
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,520
You're doing some function, you're running some functions on the contents of it and creating

266
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,080
a new array, but the old one is still left intact.

267
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,080
And I think that is what they call having functions that have no side effects.

268
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,880
So if you give it the same thing, it'll always return, give you the same result, there's

269
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,880
no surprises.

270
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,560
So it's interesting.

271
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:55,480
I think in a lot of ways, we go forward and then we step back a little bit and then we

272
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,080
go forward and then we step back a little bit.

273
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:06,360
I think the same thing happened with Jamstack where, I mean, some aspects of Jamstack is

274
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,400
new, but the underlying idea behind it is pretty much like we used to build websites

275
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,640
back in the early 2000s, where it's nothing more than just HTML, CSS and JavaScript that

276
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,360
sits on a server and it's just pushed to your browser.

277
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,000
Of course, with the modern capabilities of browsers and stuff, you have all kinds of

278
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,440
stuff you can do then on top of that to enhance the experience, like making stuff available

279
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,480
offline, being able to respond to different screen sizes and environments and all that

280
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,760
kind of stuff.

281
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,160
But the basic idea of serving static pages, that's something that happened way back in

282
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
the day.

283
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,320
And now it's again evolving.

284
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:54,760
Now it seems like people are kind of still interested in Jamstack, but now they're embracing

285
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:01,360
this new thing of edge functions and serverless, which I'm still trying to wrap my head around

286
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,080
exactly what that all means.

287
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
Yeah, me too.

288
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,280
These serverless functions, I haven't really looked into that deeply.

289
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:22,120
I've read a little bit about them in the context of the Microsoft Azure offerings, but I haven't

290
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,760
really tried anything with them.

291
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,320
But what you're talking about just a minute ago with JavaScript, we used to call that

292
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,720
back in the day either calling something by value or by reference.

293
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,520
If you call it by value, you change its value perhaps, or not, you don't change.

294
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,440
If you pass by value, then you can't change the value because you don't know where it's

295
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
stored in memory.

296
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,160
So you just have to return something else.

297
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,080
But if you pass something by reference, then you have the pointer to where it's located.

298
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,920
So you can actually change the thing that's being passed.

299
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,160
And I always thought that was pretty cool.

300
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:07,560
But I wanted to say something about JavaScript, and I like JavaScript.

301
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,200
I've written a fair bit of it.

302
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,960
In fact, last year I did the, I don't know if you're familiar with the advent of code.

303
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:23,920
It's a set of problems that this guy does every year for the first 25 days of December.

304
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:30,440
And the problems get more and more challenging as you go through the 25 days.

305
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,480
And there are two parts each day.

306
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,440
And I used JavaScript last year to do that, reasonably far into it before I kind of threw

307
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,560
my hands up and said, well, I both, A, don't have time to work on this all day long.

308
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,200
And the problems were getting like really complicated.

309
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,240
And I just thought, well, I'll do this again next year.

310
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,360
But I also wanted to learn JavaScript.

311
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:03,160
The more I've learned JavaScript, and you know, when you're talking about the different

312
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:12,320
ways to do things in JavaScript, I'm almost always reminded of a quote that I read.

313
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:23,640
I used to actually had a copy of it pinned up to my wall when I was working.

314
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,240
I wish I still had it, but I'm paraphrasing a little bit.

315
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,920
But the effect of the quote was when you're writing code, you're not trying to tell the

316
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,080
computer what to do.

317
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,200
What you're trying to do is tell other programmers what you're doing, or maybe even remind yourself

318
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:50,840
six months from now why you did what you did and why you did it this way.

319
00:27:50,840 --> 00:28:02,960
That is so, so true because the code that I've written in C, I would do a project, get

320
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,520
finished with it, put it away, maybe six, eight months or a year later, the guy that

321
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,080
I wrote it for would come back and say, hey, we've got another set of data, but now we've

322
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,000
got this different kind of quirk.

323
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,400
And hey, can you get that code out and add it enough to do this and then process it?

324
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,920
I did lots of what's called data reduction and analysis and processing.

325
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,800
And so I'd say, yeah, sure, I can do that.

326
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,320
And I would take out, I'd go find the file and edit it.

327
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:45,480
And sometimes, especially early on, I would look at the code and I'd be like, who wrote

328
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
this?

329
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,920
And why do they hate me?

330
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,800
Because it was foreign.

331
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:04,320
So that encouraged me to both start writing better comments in the code and also to start

332
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:12,440
doing things in really the simplest way possible.

333
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,520
Even if there was a clever way of doing something, I would think, if I ever have to come back

334
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,040
and look at this, am I going to be able to figure out in the future how clever I was

335
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,360
today?

336
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,280
Not that I'm all that clever of a person, but sometimes I would think about kind of

337
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,560
a cool way of doing something.

338
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:41,720
And in my opinion, the simplest way to get the job done, as long as it's not horribly

339
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,640
inefficient, is probably the way you want to do it.

340
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,040
Because when you go look at it later or if some person that's maintaining the code looks

341
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:58,760
at it a year from now, they'll be able to figure out what it is you were doing relatively

342
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,280
quickly maybe.

343
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,840
And they'll be able to maintain it or update it or use it in a way that will be effective

344
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,560
for them.

345
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:18,160
In JavaScript, every time I look at a book on JavaScript, there really are too many different

346
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:27,320
ways to do any one thing.

347
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:37,680
As JavaScript has evolved, things have improved, but it used to be like the asynchronous communications

348
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
with JavaScript.

349
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:48,560
It was the try and catch, and then at some point they introduced the promises and I don't

350
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,480
know what they're up to now, but you want to use the way that works the best.

351
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,360
You don't want a lot of network congestion, but you also want to use code that's going

352
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,720
to be understandable.

353
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:13,000
And JavaScript gives you plenty of ways to just really get out there where you will never

354
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
come back.

355
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,640
It's got too many ways of doing things, whereas Fortran had too few ways of doing stuff.

356
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,800
C had about the right amount if you ask me, but then I have a special place in my heart

357
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
for C language.

358
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:40,360
I really enjoyed both the years, the time in my life, and C programming were all very

359
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,680
good to me, so I remember that very fondly.

360
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,600
Yeah, I agree.

361
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:56,560
JavaScript has evolved quite a bit in the last couple of years, not all of it necessarily

362
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
for the better.

363
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:04,600
I think there's been a lot of syntactic sugar added to the language, and I'm not always

364
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,600
sure if it's good for new people.

365
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,360
I think a lot of it can be super confusing.

366
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,640
For example, you can create a function using the function keyword, but you can also create

367
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:26,560
a variable and store a function in it where you use the fat arrow syntax.

368
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,240
The thing is, it's not actually exactly the same thing.

369
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:38,960
They're both functions that has a call signature that you can call, but the value of the this

370
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,760
keyword in a function defined with the function keyword and with arrow functions is not the

371
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,400
same.

372
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:54,400
This keyword in JavaScript has been problematic in the past, and they essentially fixed it

373
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,760
in arrow functions, but now it's important that people know the difference.

374
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:06,000
In a way, they fixed it, but in a way, now you have to adopt one of the two, because

375
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,440
otherwise you're going to potentially confuse yourself, because you're going to say, okay,

376
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,440
cool, I could just use this dot blah, and then suddenly you're in a functions context

377
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,200
and it doesn't work, but why the heck is it not working?

378
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,000
It's literally just because the value of this is different, and there's some other syntactic

379
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
sugar things as well.

380
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,920
I think one of the recent additions is this ability, I forget the name, but so essentially

381
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:43,560
instead of having to do if this thing and then do a chain, like say if variable and

382
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,500
variable dot something else property, then do this thing.

383
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,600
Now you can do variable, and then you put a little question mark, and then a dot, and

384
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,600
then the other property, and that's like a shortcut for it, and it's not always obvious

385
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,880
what the heck that question mark does.

386
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm pretty sure if people new to code looks at that, it's not going to be immediately

387
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,240
intuitive that that's actually checking, it'll only try and read the property on the right

388
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,360
if the thing on the left exists.

389
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,960
So if the thing on the left is undefined, it's not going to try and read the thing,

390
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,120
so it won't throw an error saying cannot read length of undefined.

391
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,560
You avoid that, but at the same time I'm not sure if that syntax is very intuitive, that

392
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
that is what it's doing.

393
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,160
Yeah, it's not intuitive.

394
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:43,040
I know what you're talking about, and the first time I saw that I thought it's really

395
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:55,120
nice that you can avoid the problems with undefined variables, but is it really better

396
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:02,720
than checking to see if something is defined first and then doing it in an if statement?

397
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:11,520
Is it really worth saving two lines of code to do this very kind of complex, different

398
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:22,360
looking construct, and I'm not sure where I fall on that because I haven't had an occasion

399
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:29,760
where I've written that type of construct yet, so I mean maybe it is, and also going

400
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:38,720
back to functions, the anonymous functions in JavaScript gave me fits at first.

401
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,040
I found them kind of difficult to construct at first and probably would have a problem

402
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,560
with them now because I haven't written JavaScript very much recently, but my understanding is

403
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,760
that the anonymous functions have the advantage that once they're used and they're out of

404
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:04,080
scope they're no longer taking memory, which is probably a good enough rationale to use

405
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:11,800
them when you can, but they certainly can be confusing.

406
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,920
They're also hard to debug because if something happens in your code it doesn't have a name

407
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:22,680
to reference because it's anonymous, right, so it can't tell you function with this name

408
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,200
is where the error occurred, it's more going to have to try and tell you on which line

409
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,240
it happened and then you're on your own there.

410
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,200
Then you go back to the tried and true age old method of debugging of putting in print

411
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,760
statements to say, okay, hey, I passed this line and now I'm at this line and now I'm

412
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:50,600
at this line and this variable is now this and this and this and, you know, symbolic

413
00:36:50,600 --> 00:37:05,280
debuggers were also just an incredible advancement in debugging. It really beats the endless number

414
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,240
of print statements that you have to put in to figure things out.

415
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,840
That's true, but at the same time I wonder how approachable they are because I still

416
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:22,040
find more often than not people using console.log or console.error or whatever to figure out

417
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,720
what the heck's going on other than flipping open the developer tools and using the script

418
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:38,020
debugger in there. I very rarely work with somebody that uses that as opposed to using

419
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:49,040
just console.log statements. Like me myself, I mostly use console.log. I've always mean

420
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,560
to study like these things because I know that if you know how to use it well, it's

421
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:01,240
probably going to serve you better and save you time, but you need to make time to learn

422
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,520
it because those things are pretty complex.

423
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,880
It is. You're quite correct and I think that there's a tipping point in there that, you

424
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,440
know, if you've got a small section of code that you're working with and you need to figure

425
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:25,200
something out that's not terribly complex and you're not, you know, deep into a three

426
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,420
or four dimensional array, yeah, putting a console.log or print statement or something

427
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:39,080
like that, you know, that's kind of the first line of defense. But very quickly, if that

428
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:46,360
doesn't show me where the problem is, I am much quicker these days to, you know, open

429
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:54,920
the developer tools, go in there and see, you know, with Visual Studio to open the debugger

430
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:01,360
and just start working through it because being able to set breakpoints and watch variables

431
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:10,600
and see exactly what is in memory without having to put in statements that you then

432
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:19,320
have to go back and take out or comment out is really, it's almost magical what debuggers

433
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:27,360
can do today and I would say I would encourage anybody, yeah, I mean, a couple of console

434
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:32,800
log statements or print statements in Python or something, you know, if that gets the job

435
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,640
done that's fine but it's, you'll do yourself a favor if you start learning the debugging

436
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,200
tools because they can really, not only do they, not only can they show you what the

437
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:55,560
problem is but sometimes they can also illuminate other issues with the same code that you might

438
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:03,880
not see until you get to a boundary condition and that, you know, that I think also is valuable.

439
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:11,840
Yeah, yeah. I wonder if one of the reasons people haven't adopted these as much is maybe

440
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:19,600
a lack of educational material in this area because, I mean, not that I've really dug

441
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:27,100
deep for this but I haven't really that just, I mean, I see a lot of news about what's happening

442
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,920
with the developer world and nothing like this has really come across my radar where

443
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:40,120
there's this like, oh, there's this course by X on using the debugger tools in Chrome,

444
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,040
for example, that's really amazing and you should take it and you'll never use console

445
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:51,360
log again. I've never really seen that. So I wonder if that's maybe, if that's an area

446
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:58,720
of opportunity in the educational space. I think you're exactly right and, you know,

447
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:05,600
that's probably one of the things that the Mycelium network could help people with and,

448
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:13,920
I mean, the group that you've created, I think is fantastic. It's a good idea. It's helpful

449
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:24,760
to people at multiple different levels of experience and learning and, you know, that

450
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,760
I think would be a good venue for helping people at least to start using the tools that

451
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,840
are available and you're exactly right. Everything that I know about, especially the developer

452
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:47,680
tools and Chrome or Edge or Firefox, I've learned just by poking around or I've looked

453
00:41:47,680 --> 00:42:00,000
on one of the, done a search on and the name is Escaping Me. It's just one of the sites

454
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,720
where everybody goes to ask programming questions and I can't think of it.

455
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Stack Overflow?

456
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,200
Stack Overflow, yes, indeed. You know, I'll go there and have to say, hey, how do I do

457
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,600
a search? How do I do this? I've seldom asked questions because almost always I'm able to

458
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:23,360
find somebody else's question that's very similar and I can figure it out from there.

459
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,640
But people will say, well, if you open the developer tools and go to this pane and do

460
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,440
this, you know, you'll see, it'll show you that. And I think, oh, that's cool. I didn't

461
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,720
know that. So I go try it and hey, that really works well. And I kind of file that away.

462
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,320
And the next time I need to use something like that, I hopefully remember that I can

463
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:57,440
go to the developer tools and look at that. And I do that with CSS all the time. I mean,

464
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,280
when I'm working on a website or working on CSS, I invariably have the developer tools

465
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:14,160
open to the CSS that's being actually the CSS that's being applied. And, you know, being

466
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:24,240
able to tweak the CSS and see the change immediately is just so much better than, you know, change

467
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:34,320
it, try it, change it, try it. It's such a time saver. And I use Edge. I'm not a Microsoft

468
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:43,760
fan boy. But I like Microsoft better than I did in the 80s. I tell you that. It's a

469
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:52,800
different company, in my opinion, but we won't go down that road. With the Edge tools in

470
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:06,880
the way that it's not really a server. It's kind of the server that you can plug in that

471
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:14,320
you can get for VS code that opens Edge and runs your code in it. And I didn't know this

472
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:21,280
before I did it, but I realized one day that when I was changing the CSS in the panel on

473
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,640
the developer tools, it was actually changing it back in my source file. And so I thought,

474
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,440
hey, that's pretty cool. If I find out what I like, I don't even have to go back. I just

475
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,360
kind of double check, you know, look, make sure that it's there and I'm good to go. So

476
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:43,880
that's, you know, we're getting there. I don't think we're at the utopia yet, but it's, things

477
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:54,000
are a lot better than they were even 10 years ago or more. And my first experience with

478
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,080
web development was in the very late 90s. You may recall that people were worried about

479
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,680
the Y2K problem and the conversion of the dates and everything. And one of the things

480
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,200
that I was working on was a project to make sure that, you know, we were, we were ready

481
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:23,480
for Y2K. And so I developed a website to track some of the issues. And that was before JavaScript

482
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,720
even. And, you know, there were no real databases. So those were the days of the CGI scripts.

483
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:36,840
And I was writing C code and putting it in the CGI directory and then doing the calls.

484
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:43,400
And I couldn't even do that today. I'd have to learn how to do it again. But it was, you

485
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:49,120
know, people think, well, those were the days. Well, those were the days. But I don't want

486
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:56,600
to go back there because what we have now is so much better that, you know, it's, you

487
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:02,880
can, you can remember fondly that you did that. But, you know, it's like, I grew up

488
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,960
in the, in the, in the southern part of the United States, the southeastern part. And

489
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:15,440
it was fairly warm in the summertime. And for the first several years of my life, we

490
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,360
didn't have air conditioning. And so, you know, once we got air conditioning, you know,

491
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,760
I don't want to go back to a time without air conditioning, even though I don't, I

492
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:31,960
don't live that far south now, it still gets pretty warm and somewhat humid here. So, you

493
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,840
know, like my air conditioning, you know, I fondly remember, hey, we got, we got by

494
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,360
without it. But I don't want to go back there.

495
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:49,880
Yeah, yeah. And I do think the CSS tools are much more approachable than the JavaScript

496
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:56,720
debuggers. But again, I think it's maybe just a lack of knowledge and a lack of educational

497
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,160
material. Maybe they aren't just as approachable. It's, it's obviously a completely different

498
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,960
paradigm. But, you know, a lot of it translates like the same way which you can see, oh, this

499
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,160
CSS is being applied to this element. You can see, oh, at this point, this variable

500
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,640
has this value. And I'm pretty confident you'll be able to change the value and see the impact

501
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:27,360
of it in that. I think one of the tricky things with these debuggers, and again, it's probably

502
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:33,840
an educational thing, but with the use of frameworks, I think oftentimes it's, it's

503
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:40,600
a little tricky to avoid stepping into the code that is actually part of the framework

504
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:46,800
and being completely lost. And then having to dig your way out of the framework code

505
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,160
back to where it's, again, the code that you wrote to get to the problem. But again, you

506
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,760
know, because you have step into, step over, and all those kinds of things. So it's understanding

507
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,040
when do you want to step into, when do you want to step over, so that you avoid drilling

508
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:12,080
into the stuff. But with that said, I do know that the Chromium dev tools have this ability

509
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:20,040
to exclude certain libraries. So you can say, by the way, anything that's like jQuery, don't

510
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:26,400
go there. So if something is, would have stepped into the jQuery code, it'll just step over

511
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
it instead.

512
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:35,640
Oh, that's cool. Yeah. But again, I was going to say, I remember back in the late 80s, I

513
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:41,080
was doing something with the Visual Studio and I was doing some debugging and I accidentally

514
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:49,080
stepped into one of the dynamic league libraries and windows. And I was immediately, you know,

515
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:55,480
I had no idea what I was looking at. And then of course, I didn't have the symbols for that.

516
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:01,760
So it was all just basically Greek. So basically, I started again and made sure I stepped over

517
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,840
the next time. But yeah, you're exactly right on that.

518
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:18,320
Yeah. So to switch it up a little bit, I read that you are really into cars, automobiles.

519
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:27,080
And I know recently you've gotten into motorcycles. But the one thing that I, when reading the

520
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:33,200
history that you have on one of your blogs, the one thing that's been common throughout

521
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:42,520
that entire line is you would always join these automobile clubs. And I mean, automobile

522
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:50,300
clubs are essentially communities. So I wonder with that in mind, like, what does community

523
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:56,920
mean to you? And what led you to this, this, this, what can you call it, this pattern of

524
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,540
always reaching out, always searching out for a community around the specific interest

525
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:08,760
that you have? Well, let me tell you what I think community

526
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:18,440
means to me is a group of people that have some common interest or common bond and are

527
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:27,000
willing to both share their knowledge and excitement with others and also help others

528
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,280
who maybe don't have as much experience or haven't lived through some of the early part

529
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:42,160
of like, say, cars in the 60s and 70s being different from today, for example, to help

530
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:50,320
them along to understand maybe some of the changes or whatever. So it's really a community

531
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:59,360
to me as a group of people who are all interested in some topic, helping each other to understand

532
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:12,600
it better and move forward either individually or as a group to improve the topic, if you

533
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:21,200
will, if that's doable, or just to enhance each other's enjoyment of a particular brand

534
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:30,900
of car, type of car. And in the tech industry, being able to ask questions and learn from

535
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,880
people who have done things, then you need to do this and you're interested in learning

536
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:47,160
how to do it. But, you know, a lot of the documentation, and I'll use Git and GitHub

537
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:56,560
as an example, the documentation can be both very accurate and very unapproachable at the

538
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:04,920
same time. I mean, when I go back and read some of the documentation that I read a long

539
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,680
time ago, now it makes sense, but now I know how to do what it's talking about. And so

540
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:18,880
recently I asked you, how do I do this? And you were very gracious and walked me through

541
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:25,120
how to do this thing that I was trying to do. And I had looked at the documentation

542
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,400
and it just didn't, it just, I couldn't figure out, it didn't make sense. I didn't know

543
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:39,200
why, how to put the steps together or what the motivation for doing that was. But having

544
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,080
somebody who has experienced that and is willing to say, well, you do it this way because of

545
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:56,000
this and here is the, I think, workflow or the flow of anything is not immediately apparent

546
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,360
when you're working on something that's new to you. You don't see the overall

547
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:08,440
picture. You see the piece of it that you're working on right now. And so having somebody

548
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:15,600
that understands the whole subject or all of the workflow is just invaluable. And I

549
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:23,360
think that's part of being part of a community. And the reason that I always, the reason that

550
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:31,280
I personally, just for me, seek out those types of communities is because as an extreme

551
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:43,440
introvert, I just, I have no ability to engage in small talk. I mean, it just exhausts me

552
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:51,080
trying to chat with people about nothing. I mean, I've gone to parties that didn't

553
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:56,480
really have a theme or anything that everybody was interested in. It was just, hey, let's

554
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,280
get together and have a party. And after about 10 minutes, I'm thinking, well, I could be

555
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:10,560
doing something else. And it's just, no, we're not talking about anything that I'm interested

556
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:22,200
in. So I'm just going to leave now. So in order to have a community, I seek out people

557
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:30,520
that I share a common interest with. And of course, the more interest that I share with

558
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:36,840
a person or a group of people, the better that is, because that gives me more points

559
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:45,280
of connection if you want to look at it that way. And so that has been, the internet age

560
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:52,600
has really been a good thing for me because I've been able to connect with folks who I

561
00:54:52,600 --> 00:55:00,640
would never have known if it weren't for some group. And the way that I first got exposed

562
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:07,960
to Discord, one of the things that I do, I play some video games on both consoles and

563
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:16,640
PC. But I play Final Fantasy XIV off and on. I'm not on every day. But when I got to a

564
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,800
certain point in that, I wasn't making much progress because I wasn't sure what to do

565
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,120
next. So I kind of sought out a community. And somebody said, well, why don't you join

566
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,040
this Discord server? And there's a bunch of people there. And I thought, well, I don't

567
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:37,160
even know what Discord is. So I looked it up and signed up and joined the server. And

568
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:45,120
the folks there were great. I put a question. And within minutes, usually, somebody had

569
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,880
said, well, you should maybe look at this or try this or whatever. And I went from not

570
00:55:50,880 --> 00:56:00,720
having any idea what to do to having almost too much information on it. And so that's

571
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:08,520
kind of the other side of the coin. But the communities that I've been able to find on

572
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:21,880
the internet in general, but Discord specifically, have been quite helpful. Also, as an introvert,

573
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:33,560
it allows me to control the amount of interaction. So if I get to a point where I'm just, I can't

574
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:39,240
do it anymore, I can sort of walk away from the computer or just stop reading it for a

575
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:47,880
little while. And it allows me to read something, read an answer that somebody's provided, and

576
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,000
then think about that. And it's asynchronous. I don't have to respond right away. I can

577
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,520
take my time to internalize it, think about it, decide what my approach is or what my

578
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:09,040
thought is, and then I can reply if it's necessary. So that has been very good. Whereas in a face

579
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:19,880
to face meeting or communication, and I'm not against that. I can do that. It's just,

580
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:27,720
I'm sure you've been in meetings where all but one person in the meeting, it's clear

581
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,480
that we're done, it's time to go, we're finished with this. There's this one person

582
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:44,120
who just keeps, they just can't stop. And so that I find really frustrating. So I can

583
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:55,280
do the in-person meetings, but in in-person meetings, people tend to expect a response

584
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:05,440
pretty quickly. And I don't always have a response quickly, especially if it's a question

585
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:12,000
or something that I need to think about for a while. And so online communities are just

586
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,760
great for that because I can look at something, read it, and somebody's got a question, I

587
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:23,720
think, well, I kind of understand what they want, but I'm not sure how to phrase it. So

588
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:29,160
I'll go away for a while and it sits in the back of my mind. And then later on, I'll come

589
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:35,800
back and say, oh, yeah, this is the way I want to put this. And I type the message to

590
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:43,600
them and it makes sense and it helps them. And that's wonderful. I enjoy helping people

591
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:50,400
and I want to help be as good to people and help them as much as I can. But sometimes

592
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,680
I have to have to think about how to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Not for sure. No, I completely

593
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:02,640
understand it. I also like the asynchronous means of communication. I had it in a meeting

594
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:11,200
if somebody puts you on the spot to estimate a timeline or to give an answer to something.

595
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,520
It's like, don't put me on the spot like that. I need to think about this. Otherwise, I'm

596
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:26,640
going to say something and then I'm going to probably regret it. And at some of these,

597
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,520
for one of the clients that I've worked for a long time, they have these all hands meetings

598
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:38,400
where everybody comes together. And I oftentimes have to excuse myself and go to my hotel room

599
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:45,080
just for a while, just to decompress because I can only social so much and then I need

600
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:51,360
to decompress. Well, and the more people you have in a room at the same time, especially

601
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:58,880
a meeting about something, the more avenues of communication you have. So you're trying

602
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:06,120
to deal with all of that. You're trying to maintain the lines of communication to each

603
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:10,680
of the other people in the room. And when you have too many people, you just really

604
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:21,360
can't do that. So they used to, one of the projects that I was on, they used to have

605
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:27,760
these like week long meetings. I mean, they would get people from all over the place and

606
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:34,920
we'd sit in a big conference room and there'd probably be 40 or 45 people in there. And

607
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:44,840
it was just all day long for all week. And so little would get done because everybody

608
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:55,400
wanted to have their voice heard and put their two cents in. And I thought if you would just

609
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:03,720
break this down into its component issues and then have the people meet that have a

610
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:10,720
vested interest in that issue, get those people together, the three or four or five of them,

611
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:16,600
let them hash it out for an hour or so, they'll come up with a solution. But in a room of

612
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:30,600
40 people, it's really difficult to do that. And then somebody had in another project,

613
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:36,640
they had an epiphany. I said, hey, when we have meetings, we're not going to sit down.

614
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:43,440
We're going to stand up during the whole meeting. And that kind of focused people's thoughts

615
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,960
because instead of sitting there eating donuts and drinking coffee, they're standing there

616
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:56,120
and people get tired of kind of standing up doing nothing. So that was helpful. So being

617
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:07,680
able to focus is an art form in some sense. And it's necessary to get real work done.

618
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,000
I mean, if you just want to stand around and chat for a while, that's fine. But if you

619
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:20,640
want to solve a problem, you need to focus on the problem, get inputs from people who

620
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,220
are stakeholders who have a vested interest in that problem, and then find something that

621
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:34,000
will work for the majority or all of those people. And large meetings make that difficult.

622
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:46,720
That's for sure. So when you talked about how things have improved in terms of the languages

623
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:51,640
that's available to us, the tooling that's available to us, and how the industry has

624
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:56,680
moved on and how you used to be able to work. I also think about stuff like in the past,

625
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:02,160
if you wanted to learn something, you had to go to the bookstore and buy a book and

626
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:08,380
they were very expensive. Unless you had a library that had a really good collection

627
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:15,120
of books, you pretty much you had to save up and go buy that book. These days, of course,

628
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:20,160
that's almost unheard of. You just do a quick search and you find a thing or you find an

629
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:28,800
online course or you use institutions like Stanford with their open curriculum and the

630
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:37,640
access to information is just incredible. But with all of that, I saw you mention in

631
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:46,840
one of your posts about the movie Hidden Figures. And what's been highlighted in there is this

632
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:51,840
role that women and underrepresented people actually played in something as monumental

633
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:59,480
as the moon landing and all of these kinds of things. So I'm wondering, with all of this

634
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:07,160
improvement that's happened, do you think the quality of software has actually improved

635
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:13,840
in step with all these other improvements that we've had? And secondly, in general,

636
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:20,080
do you think that the tech industry has really improved as much as you would have thought

637
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:27,480
it would seeing that we have had all of these underlying enhancements and improvements to

638
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:33,520
the way we work and the languages and the tools we have access to?

639
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:44,240
I think software, the quality of software in general has improved. It still got a ways

640
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:52,880
to go, but some of the testing approaches that are being used now, I think, are making

641
01:04:52,880 --> 01:05:00,840
software more reliable than it was. And I mean, the thing that I would point to on that

642
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:15,000
is the difference between, let's say, Windows 3 and Windows 11. And I remember Windows version

643
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:22,640
3 and 3.311 specifically, because that was the one where they added the networking capability.

644
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:30,800
But it was probably multiple times a day. I was doing a hard reset on the machine. I

645
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,280
was doing a hard reset on the machine because it got into some state where it was no longer

646
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:41,360
paying any attention to the mouse or anything. So if you can reach the big red switch, you

647
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:49,400
turn it off, wait a second, turn it back on, and start over. And that does occasionally

648
01:05:49,400 --> 01:06:04,000
still happen, but not nearly at the rate that it did in the mid-90s. I would say these days,

649
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:12,360
I mean, my primary machine stays on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I mean, I log out, close

650
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:19,400
the lid of a laptop, turn the monitor off at night. But it'll run for sometimes weeks

651
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:25,480
at a time. And the only reason I rebooted is because there's an update that requires

652
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:34,040
a reboot. So I think things, the quality of some software has improved. It's not really

653
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:40,040
consistent across the board. Some shops have done a much better job at improving their

654
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:48,960
quality than others. But yeah, that's just the human condition. I mean, some brands of

655
01:06:48,960 --> 01:07:00,520
automobiles are much more reliable than others. So that's just kind of the way things work.

656
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:14,640
As far as making progress in treating people more equitably and having a wider representation

657
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:35,520
of people in the field, I wish we had made more progress in that. I have worked with

658
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:42,960
all different types of people from all ethnic backgrounds, lots of people who did not speak

659
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:56,760
English as a native language. One of the projects I was on, I traveled to Germany multiple times

660
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:03,160
a year for two or three weeks at a time and saw the difference between the culture here

661
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:19,520
and the culture there. And you realize pretty quickly that you have to give people grace.

662
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:26,720
When you go somewhere else, you're necessarily going to be in a different environment. And

663
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:38,280
so you have to be open to differences from what you're used to. And the think tank that

664
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:49,400
I worked for was an interesting place to work because like 95% of the folks there, the staff

665
01:08:49,400 --> 01:09:00,080
members had at least one PhD, sometimes more than that. And almost all of them were in

666
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:06,040
what I call, and I think most people would refer to as the hard sciences. We had lots

667
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:17,440
of physicists, lots of astrophysicists, mathematicians, statisticians, chemical engineers, that type

668
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:40,560
of thing. And it was mostly white males. But we also had people of color and not only black

669
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:49,360
and brown people, but also Asians. And I mean, pretty much a little bit of everything. We

670
01:09:49,360 --> 01:10:04,280
had women who worked there. And I just always try to treat people like I would want to be

671
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:20,000
treated. And I try to just look, they're a person, they're an individual. And be as accommodating

672
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:32,480
as I can and help them out and not be mean or evil or whatever. And I think that has

673
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:44,280
to do with the way that I was raised, more than a conscious decision to be that way.

674
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:53,960
As I mentioned, I grew up in the deep southeast in the United States in the late 50s and 60s.

675
01:10:53,960 --> 01:11:03,240
I'll live through a lot of the stuff that went on during that time. But my father was

676
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:09,720
a civilian employee at a military base. He was civil service and worked as a civilian

677
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:18,480
on a military base. And he was dealing with mostly non-commissioned officers like sergeants

678
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:27,000
and things like that. And they came from all over the place. And so, you know, often at

679
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Thanksgiving, he would say he would invite one or two of them to come have Thanksgiving

680
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,840
with us, because they were in a situation where they couldn't go back to where they

681
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:46,440
were from. So we would have people from different ethnicities and different backgrounds. And

682
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:57,640
sometimes radically different belief systems than us. And my parents just always treated

683
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:07,120
them the same as they would treat family. And so I just kind of grew up thinking that

684
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:16,400
this is the way you treat people. You treat them with compassion and if they need something

685
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:25,880
you try to help them. And, you know, when I got kind of into the real world and realized

686
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:37,320
that not everybody does that, I was saddened by that because, you know, there's no reason

687
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:50,440
for it. I think we need to give people the chance to excel to whatever level they are

688
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:59,720
able to, given their intellectual capacity and their determination, their interest, their

689
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:07,560
motivation. I mean, you know, people are all different. And, you know, a lot of people

690
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:18,800
are a lot smarter than me and a lot more successful. And hey, that's great. But, you know, I don't

691
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:25,760
fault them for that, because they haven't tried to prevent me from being what I wanted

692
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:36,280
to be. And so in turn, I try to never prevent anyone from attaining what they want to attain.

693
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:40,040
And if I can help them get there, I'm going to do that. I mean, one of the things that

694
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,080
I learned from my father, who was a good man, was that if you can help somebody, you do

695
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:51,160
it. You don't pay attention to what color their skin is or what they believe in or where

696
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:58,400
they came from or, you know, what sex they are or whatever. If you can help somebody,

697
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:08,600
you help them, you know. And he did that his entire life. And so I hope that I am like

698
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:15,800
that. I want to think that I am. I try to be. And so I think if we would all be that

699
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:23,960
way, maybe the world would be a little better. Yeah, yeah, that's beautiful. I totally agree.

700
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:29,560
And I can say from what I've from the interactions I've had with you and seen you have with others

701
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:34,600
on the Mycelium Network, you're definitely following in the footsteps of your father.

702
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:46,280
So you can rest assured of that. Yeah. So I also read your blog where you're detailing

703
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:53,480
your journey of getting back into the tech world and specifically web development. And

704
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,480
you had this kind of mantra of sorts that you wrote that I really liked. And what you

705
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:03,480
wrote was, start with the basics, be consistent, write some code every day, and stay focused.

706
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:10,840
I think that's tremendous advice that I would echo to anybody that's getting into any industry,

707
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:16,800
really. But especially like in coding, that is definitely something great. So how's your

708
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:22,120
journey been so far, getting back into the industry and specifically this web development

709
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:31,040
industry? Well, if I could follow my own advice, I'd probably be doing better. But it's one

710
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:42,680
of those things where you know what you should do, but the distance between knowing what

711
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:53,440
you should do and doing it is that there's not always an easy path. And so I would say,

712
01:15:53,440 --> 01:16:02,000
I love programming. I mean, I could, you know, when I get immersed in a programming problem

713
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,960
and project, you know, I can start and I think it's been five minutes and it's really been

714
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:15,920
five hours. And it's just, you know, it's like no time has passed. And I'm sure you

715
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:30,040
have experienced that. But during my career, I got pulled into different aspects of computing

716
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:40,000
and I'll use computing in a very broad sense. So that, you know, after probably five or

717
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:49,440
six or seven years of really writing Fortran or C pretty much all day, every day, I got

718
01:16:49,440 --> 01:17:00,640
into, well, we need somebody to, you know, create a database. And so at the time, I think

719
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:07,200
Ingress was one of the databases that was available on the VAX. And, you know, so I

720
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:13,360
would learn the language for that and started, you know, designing things and creating tables

721
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:21,360
and relations and all that. So that that was sort of like programming, but not really.

722
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:26,920
And then I started getting pulled into some like system administration type stuff. And

723
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:35,520
I started running some, well, they used to refer to them as workstations like silicon

724
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,880
graphics. We had a couple of silicon graphics workstations, you know, the high end graphics

725
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:46,200
workstations. We had a couple of HP, you know, workstations running HP's version of Unix.

726
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:52,080
And so I got into that and that was that was less like programming. But, you know, these

727
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,440
people were paying me to show up and do what they needed me to do. So they said, we need

728
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:03,880
you to do this. So I did, I did what they needed me to do. And then it kind of went

729
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:15,880
from there. And I got into doing some what would now be called cyber security. They actually

730
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:20,760
sent me to, I don't know if you're familiar with the SANS Institute. You can look them

731
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:28,800
up on sans.org. But I've taken, you know, they paid for and sent me to take like five

732
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:38,160
or six of their different courses. And, you know, security is necessary. And it's, it's

733
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:45,880
a little bit interesting, but it's not coding. So over the years, I got away from programming.

734
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,080
And that's, I mean, that's, that's, that's why I got into this to start with. I mean,

735
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:55,240
I went, I told you, I went to that Fortran course and I thought, yeah, this is great

736
01:18:55,240 --> 01:19:01,120
stuff. And I started, you know, banging out code. And, and, you know, you'd run, you'd

737
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:07,480
go to the card reader and read your deck in and you'd wait, I don't know, an hour, hour

738
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:11,720
and a half or 45 minutes or whatever it was, depending on how busy the computer was. And

739
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,960
then you'd, your printout would come out and you'd see the listing and then the error message.

740
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,600
Oh, I got, you know, so I got to go back and change this and change. And then when it finally

741
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:27,160
runs, it's like annihilation, you know, it's, it's a, it's a, it's one of those small successes.

742
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:35,040
And I, you know, I, that, that, um, I, I really enjoy that. I, I, I like to have, have code

743
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,640
that I've written and run it and see that it works. And man, that's just great. So when

744
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:49,160
I, uh, when I basically retired, um, from full-time work and I kind of, I also had a

745
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:54,120
business on the side doing IT management for small businesses in the, in the area where

746
01:19:54,120 --> 01:20:03,320
I live. Um, you know, doing network administration and server administration and updates and

747
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:10,680
you know, all that good stuff. Um, and so I finally got most of those clients transition

748
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:16,920
to other providers and I was able to stop doing that. And I thought, well, now I can

749
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:23,240
get back to, to coding. I want to, I want to write some code. And at the time I looked

750
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:27,840
around and thought, well, you know, writing code today pretty much means websites. You

751
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:35,160
know, it's, it's either, you know, WordPress plugins or themes or something of that nature.

752
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:43,920
Um, but, but it was, it had changed so much from the last time I had done that, that type

753
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:53,200
of thing that I was faced with this just overwhelming number of options. Um, and you mentioned your

754
01:20:53,200 --> 01:21:01,680
frameworks and not only frameworks, but languages and, um, you know, WordPress versus Joomla

755
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:10,280
versus, you know, roll your own website. And, um, uh, you know, what is it? My SQL versus

756
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:20,680
Maria DB versus no SQL databases or, you know, and so it's, uh, it's kind of a bewildering,

757
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:29,320
um, uh, landscape of possibilities. And so I thought, you know, that that's where I thought,

758
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:34,480
you know, I got to, I've got to concentrate on the basics. I need to, I need to figure

759
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:43,800
out what is the kind of basic set of, of, uh, of, um, software and skills that I need

760
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:49,960
to work on to be able to do this. And that, you know, to me that turns out to be HTML

761
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:58,720
five, CSS three, uh, and JavaScript. And then, um, my SQL typically is, is very available

762
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:06,800
on most, uh, um, uh, web service, you know, web server providers. So those, that's what

763
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:14,500
I sort of started concentrating on. And then of course, PHP is, is easy, uh, to get access

764
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:20,360
to also, uh, because so many sites are running WordPress. Um, so, you know, PHP is almost

765
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:30,000
always available. And, uh, so I, it, it, I, I had to really, um, kind of figure out what

766
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:38,240
pieces I wanted to start with because I was fairly familiar with HTML back in the early

767
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:45,280
days. Um, but that, that has changed with HTML five. They've added new, uh, new tags

768
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:53,320
and you know, it's better, but it's a little more to know. Um, and then CSS, I mean, I

769
01:22:53,320 --> 01:23:03,000
was using inline, uh, styling, uh, back in the late nineties, early two thousands. Um,

770
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:10,960
but you know, CSS and now with, uh, CSS being able to import, you know, other, uh, CSS files

771
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:18,280
that that's, that's a good thing. And so it's been, it's been a journey. Um, but yeah, I

772
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:26,360
mean, trying to, trying to stay focused on the basics is also kind of difficult though,

773
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:31,800
because you know, you, you're here about some, you know, cool new technology and you want

774
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,520
to go look at it and kind of say, well, how could I incorporate this and what can I do

775
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:42,400
with it? Cause it, it's so new and it's shiny and you know, um, and so you want to do that.

776
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:50,040
So I, it's, it's a, it's a challenge to really stay focused. Um, it, it's also a, a terrible

777
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:56,680
challenge to, to write some code every day. I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll say, okay,

778
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,920
I gotta, I gotta start coding. I will write some every day and I'll, I'll do that for

779
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:07,320
a while. And then there'll be something that happens. I mean, life happens, you know, there'll

780
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:12,880
be something that I have to go do one day and I can't get to my coding that day. And

781
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:17,680
when you miss one day, then it's easy to miss another day. And pretty soon you haven't coded

782
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:24,840
anything in two weeks. And, um, so it's, it's, it's been challenging, but it's, it's also

783
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:33,600
been a, it's been fun because, um, I am fortunate enough not to have to do it as a, as a money

784
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:40,680
making proposition. I mean, with, with my, my wife's retirement, my retirement or social

785
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:46,920
security and stuff like that, you know, we're, we're not rich by any stretch of the imagination,

786
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:52,800
but we're, you know, we're, we're okay. And so, you know, I'm at the, I'm at the point

787
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,520
where if I say, yeah, I just don't want to do anything to almost sit around and read

788
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:02,000
or, you know, just go to the park, take a walk or go to the beach or whatever. I can

789
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:08,920
do that. Um, and you know, a lot of, and I, I realized a lot of people, most people aren't

790
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:16,960
in that situation. Um, so I, and believe me, I, I realize I've, you know, I've, I've got

791
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:26,760
it pretty good. Um, but I still, I still try to maintain, um, some, uh, some momentum and

792
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:32,080
some motivation because, you know, if it, there's nothing else to keep me motivated

793
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:40,960
right now other than either my self motivation or if somebody says, Hey, I, I, I, I'm having

794
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,880
a problem with this. I don't, don't know how to do it. Or I, I don't know how to write

795
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,720
this function to do this thing. Um, can you give me a hand? And that, that gives me a

796
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:57,440
specific thing to work on. And I, I find that to be much easier than, than to find internal

797
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:04,280
motivation to do it. That's why I told you last year, I did the, the advent of code and

798
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:09,280
this it's an every year thing. The guy doesn't does it every year. And I'll probably do that

799
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:15,680
again this December to, um, you know, to, to focus my efforts on, I'll probably use

800
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:22,820
JavaScript again, using node JS, uh, to do that, um, to, to hone some of those skills

801
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:28,760
and to, to try to improve, uh, in that, that area, because that, that gives me a very good

802
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:34,080
focal point. Maybe I use Python this year. Anyway, I haven't decided, but you get the

803
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:43,120
idea. Um, it's, it's, it's a, it's a way to maintain, um, focus and motivation without

804
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:49,280
having to continually come up with something new. And that, that, that's the challenges

805
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:55,360
is finding something interesting to do. Yeah. I know for sure that it's something I need

806
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,840
as well. I, I can't just, I think I've mentioned it a couple of times from some of the other

807
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,760
podcast episodes. Like I can't just learn something for the sake of learning it. I need

808
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:11,080
an outlet. I need an outlet for it. Um, otherwise I either lose interest or I go down rabbit

809
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:18,600
holes that doesn't serve me in any way. Um, so I totally get that. So, um, in closing,

810
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:26,520
I know you've mentioned that you, uh, collect coffee cups and now I partially know why you

811
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:32,720
do that because you also love coffee. So what is it that you like about coffee and what

812
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:42,280
is some of your favorite coffees? Um, I like everything about coffee. Uh, I like the aroma

813
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:49,400
of the uncooked or the, you know, the, the aroma of the ground beans. Uh, I love the

814
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:56,600
aroma of the coffee while it's brewing. Um, I actually liked the taste of coffee. I know

815
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:07,200
a lot of people don't. Um, I just, I, I, I enjoy the warmth of the drink itself. Um,

816
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:16,120
I enjoy the, um, the activity that surrounds coffee. I mean, we, we, my wife and I live

817
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:21,560
on a small lake and we have a patio that, uh, with the back of our house faces the lake

818
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:27,000
and we have this nice patio that's covered and on nice days, uh, we have a table and

819
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:34,200
chairs there. We can take a cup of coffee out and, um, talk about life, the universe

820
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:41,720
and everything or, you know, uh, you know, read a book or whatever and have a cup of

821
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:49,800
coffee and it's just, it's just really nice. Um, I, I, I tell you what the coffee that

822
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:55,600
we're buying right now is from a small roaster. I think they're in California. It's called

823
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:05,040
Angelino's coffee and it's a, it's a family owned and run. Uh, I think they do everything

824
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:10,640
from, from, from, I mean, I think they grow their own beans and everything from there

825
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:18,640
to the finished ground product. Um, and the reason that we're using them now, rather than

826
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:25,440
I was buying a lot of caribou coffee, which is a larger, um, um, manufacturer, I think

827
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:33,080
the space in Canada. Um, I was using caribou and I like, and I like their coffees a lot,

828
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:40,120
but we had, we switched to the Keurig machine a couple of years ago, two or three, probably

829
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:45,320
more than that. Now I have, uh, I've gotten to the point where caffeine upsets, uh, my

830
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:51,600
heart rhythm. So I've, I've had to switch to decaf coffee and my, my wife still drinks

831
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:57,360
calf fully caffeinated coffee. And so, um, rather than making a pot, we, we have our

832
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:03,920
own coffee pods and a caribou Creek for a while was, was great, but then they were,

833
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:11,000
their availability of their K cup, uh, blends was, was kind of spotty. Um, green mountain

834
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:18,000
makes makes, uh, is, is a, makes pretty good coffee, but we always try to get the, the

835
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:25,680
dark roast. We, we prefer the darker, uh, roast coffees. Um, and, uh, basically anything

836
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:31,600
from Kona in Hawaii, uh, you know, anything that comes from there is going to be good

837
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:39,240
coffee, uh, Colombian, the Colombian coffees. But, but I, with, with our, with the coffee,

838
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:46,800
um, that we buy, I, I take the same approach with that as I try to do with anything else

839
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:54,200
that I can, I try to support small, uh, businesses, either local or, or a family owned business

840
01:30:54,200 --> 01:31:00,360
that somewhere else is selling over the internet. Um, you know, the, the, the individual entrepreneur

841
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:06,800
and their, their family, I think that's, I like to try to support those people to, you

842
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:13,520
know, to encourage them to continue. And as an encouragement to other, you know, would

843
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:19,520
be entrepreneurs to, you know, to, to try whatever it is that they're interested in

844
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:26,360
and, and provide that. I mean, I think too, too many people just, you know, go to Walmart

845
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:31,600
or, or whatever the local, you know, big store is and, and buy everything. And they don't

846
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:38,680
think about, um, how that affects the small businesses and the small business owner and

847
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:46,000
the families that have been, and that have been doing something for generations. And

848
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,200
now they're, they're basically priced out of the market because somebody comes along

849
01:31:51,200 --> 01:32:00,800
that can do it, you know, 3% cheaper. And a lot of people only think about the cost

850
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:06,440
to them to buy this, to buy whatever it is they need. And they don't, they don't think

851
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:14,920
about, you know, the effect on the larger world and, and putting some of these people

852
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:21,480
out of business or, or, or, you know, their families not being able to, to make a living

853
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:27,480
from this family business has been in the family for generations and now they have to

854
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:34,120
do something else. So I really, it's not always possible, but whenever, whenever I can, I

855
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:41,120
try to support a small business. And I think Angelina's, I don't have, I don't own stock

856
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:46,640
in them. I don't have any, I don't have any, you know, advertiser relationship with them

857
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:54,600
or anything like that, but I like their coffee. Um, their website works really well. Um, it's,

858
01:32:54,600 --> 01:33:01,440
it's easy to order and it tastes good. And, uh, so we're, for the time being, we're sticking

859
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:08,800
with them. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. I'm also, um, I've also had to switch to Decaf, um,

860
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:16,680
for similar reasons. Um, for me, it's an anxiety thing. Like it, if, uh, the coffee is a little

861
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:22,840
too strong, uh, it does make your heart beat faster and that, that can make you anxious

862
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:28,000
if you're prone to, to being anxious. Um, but yeah, I think that there is definitely

863
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,840
something special about coffee. Um, and like you said, the whole ritual of, like not instant

864
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:41,400
coffee. Like that's okay, but I know I, I like the ritual of, like, I'd like to buy

865
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:47,520
the beans and I have like a proper burr grinder. And so I like the sound of it when it grounds

866
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,200
the beans and you have to just find the right setting, um, play around with the settings

867
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:56,320
until you find the right thing. And there's so many different ways to brew a cup also.

868
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,200
Like, you can have like a Keurig machine, you can have drip coffee, you can have like

869
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:07,080
French press. It's really interesting. Um, yeah, I'm also a coffee lover myself. Um,

870
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:13,080
and I'm glad I, I, I'm very glad that decaf exists because I wouldn't want to have to

871
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:19,720
give up coffee at all. And, um, yeah, we have some companies in South Africa that, um, do

872
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:25,760
the fair trade thing. Um, so therefore, you know, that, uh, everybody in the chain of

873
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:31,760
getting the coffee to you is being paid fairly. And I definitely do opt to, to, to support

874
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:38,160
them over, uh, just buying some big brand at the grocery store. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

875
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:43,640
Yeah. We, we used to grind our own, um, back when we could both drink coffee with caffeine

876
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:50,720
in it. Um, and I've, I've, I've used French presses. Uh, I enjoy that. Um, I've got a

877
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:56,520
little, uh, well, I call it the one cup drip coffee maker. Uh, it's, it's actually a little

878
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:00,760
cone shaped thing that fits on top of a cup of coffee and you put the coffee in and pour

879
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:07,000
boiling water through. So I've, I've tried all of them. I still like real perked coffee

880
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,800
the best. I mean, in an old fashioned percolator and I don't have one anymore. The last one

881
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:19,200
that I had just stopped working. It was electric and I haven't tried to find another one, but

882
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:30,120
that, but it, uh, I will, I will, uh, say this and, um, as, as kind of a winding down

883
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:38,000
the, uh, URL of my main website is slow lane cafe. And that's the, that's, I have my email

884
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,280
address there. I've owned that domain since sometime in the early to mid nineties. I mean,

885
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:49,840
I registered it when that first, when you could first start registering domains. And

886
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:56,600
I chose that because I, I, I, I want to live life, not in the fast lane. I'd like to live

887
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:02,600
in the slow lane. And when we travel, we often will take side roads and, you know, just try

888
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:09,240
to find, and I think of living life in the slow lane and stopping at little roadside

889
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:15,320
cafes to have a cup of coffee. I mean, that's just kind of the whole, um, the whole reason

890
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:21,880
that I came up with that as a domain name. And, uh, and I, I probably will have that

891
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:27,760
until, uh, I am no longer here. And then it will live on. But that, that, that's how that

892
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:34,520
came. Yeah. I said, then, then it will live on even when you're not around anymore for

893
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:41,360
other people to be inspired. I hope so. Yeah, no, I'm sure. Well, thanks so much, Andy.

894
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:45,440
This was, this is a lovely conversation. I really enjoyed it. I knew it was going to

895
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:51,320
be a good one. That's why I pushed you to do it. And, um, so I'm truly grateful. Thank
