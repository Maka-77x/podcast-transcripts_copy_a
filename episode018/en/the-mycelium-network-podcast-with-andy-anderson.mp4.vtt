Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

00:06.680 --> 00:10.160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:10.160 --> 00:16.000
Hey Andy, thanks so much for joining me for the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.440
Well, thanks for having me.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.640
I'm really happy to be able to do this.

00:20.640 --> 00:26.640
Yeah, I'm really glad you agreed to do it because I know I had to convince you a little

00:26.640 --> 00:27.640
bit.

00:27.640 --> 00:34.560
I definitely am an introvert and I don't really like the limelight.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.040
Yeah, no, me too.

00:36.040 --> 00:40.760
And I've said it before, I don't know why I keep putting myself in situations that generally

00:40.760 --> 00:42.240
I shouldn't enjoy.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.760
Maybe I'm trying to force myself out of the situation.

00:45.760 --> 00:51.920
But I do enjoy a good conversation, so I think that's more what it's about.

00:51.920 --> 00:57.320
And so I think what I'm interested in a couple of things, and I sent you some notes, but

00:57.320 --> 01:03.120
I think one of the things with you that is unique from anybody else that I've had a conversation

01:03.120 --> 01:08.560
with so far is you have a really long history in tech.

01:08.560 --> 01:13.000
And I think there's a lot of really interesting things that you can share.

01:13.000 --> 01:23.160
And I'm also curious for us to kind of juxtapose when you started and now where you've kind

01:23.160 --> 01:28.040
of like trying to get back into the world of tech, but in MLDB a different industry

01:28.040 --> 01:33.160
than you were and how things have changed, what's gotten better, what's gotten worse,

01:33.160 --> 01:34.920
what's stayed the same.

01:34.920 --> 01:42.560
So I think before we dive into any specific topic, if you can kind of give us a bit of

01:42.560 --> 01:49.680
a background of who you are, where you are today, and some of the history.

01:49.680 --> 02:00.680
Yeah, well, my childhood was really pretty standard and unremarkable, but I was always

02:00.680 --> 02:09.920
interested in science and mathematics and tinkering with gadgets and electronics and

02:09.920 --> 02:15.080
I mean those things always fascinated me.

02:15.080 --> 02:26.720
So when I got to college, computers hadn't really become an area of study yet.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.680
And I kind of had two college careers.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.600
I went for a couple of years right out of high school and couldn't really decide what

02:34.600 --> 02:35.600
to do.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.600
Nothing really seemed interesting.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.880
I couldn't get excited about any of the subjects.

02:39.880 --> 02:47.720
So I quit and actually worked in a factory for a couple of years driving a forklift.

02:47.720 --> 02:51.480
After about a year of that, I thought, well, I don't really want to be doing this when

02:51.480 --> 02:53.480
I'm 50.

02:53.480 --> 02:58.600
So I thought it's probably a good idea to maybe go back to college and find something

02:58.600 --> 03:07.860
that I could be interested in that would be a little bit more fun career.

03:07.860 --> 03:15.560
So I transferred, got back into college as a junior.

03:15.560 --> 03:21.040
And the way I got into computing is a little bit different.

03:21.040 --> 03:27.520
It wasn't really something that was on my radar, but I was actually majoring in chemistry.

03:27.520 --> 03:31.440
I'd always liked chemistry and school and everything.

03:31.440 --> 03:38.280
So I was majoring in chemistry and there was one quarter that I needed a chemistry class

03:38.280 --> 03:41.020
that wasn't being offered.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.720
And so I needed something to fill out my schedule and went to talk to my advisor.

03:44.720 --> 03:51.800
And I said, I need to have a full load, full schedule, because I don't want to waste any

03:51.800 --> 03:52.800
time.

03:52.800 --> 03:57.240
And he said, well, you might want to take this FORTRAN course.

03:57.240 --> 04:05.880
He said, it'll fit into a Bachelor of Science degree really well.

04:05.880 --> 04:08.280
And I still remember exactly what he said.

04:08.280 --> 04:13.560
He said to me, computers probably aren't going to go away.

04:13.560 --> 04:18.800
And so I thought, well, I still wasn't totally convinced.

04:18.800 --> 04:23.480
So I did go and sign up for the course.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.560
I went to the first day of class.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.120
The professor seemed like a pretty nice guy.

04:28.120 --> 04:32.960
It was a large class, introductory to FORTRAN.

04:32.960 --> 04:38.080
I did not buy the book right away because I wasn't sure I was going to keep the class.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.880
So the first day of class went pretty well.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.760
So after the second day of class, I actually went and bought the book.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.400
I still have the book somewhere.

04:47.400 --> 04:51.960
It's one of the boxes that have followed me around.

04:51.960 --> 04:58.120
And after the third day of class, I went to the administration building, changed my major

04:58.120 --> 05:02.840
to computer science, and the rest is history, as they say.

05:02.840 --> 05:13.000
But when I started doing computer science in college, we were using punch cards instead

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
of terminals.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.840
So I had to go to the bookstore and buy.

05:17.840 --> 05:21.920
They had vending machines, actually, in the computing center, where you could buy a package

05:21.920 --> 05:27.680
of 100 punch cards for like a dollar or something.

05:27.680 --> 05:36.440
And for my first course, I think I probably got most of them out of the vending machine.

05:36.440 --> 05:41.760
But pretty soon after the second or third course, I thought, well, it'll be just easier

05:41.760 --> 05:46.240
and cheaper to go to the bookstore and start buying them in the big boxes of 1,000 cards

05:46.240 --> 05:49.080
in it, so that's what I did.

05:49.080 --> 05:56.040
And not too long after that, then they did install some terminals and they set up a machine

05:56.040 --> 06:03.640
to do time sharing of the IBM 370, which everything ran on.

06:03.640 --> 06:12.400
So from punch cards to today is just a stark difference.

06:12.400 --> 06:18.880
You can't even imagine what that difference is like unless you were there and lived it.

06:18.880 --> 06:23.440
And I'll give you an example of what was really one of the things that's really different

06:23.440 --> 06:27.240
today from punch cards.

06:27.240 --> 06:35.520
We had what were called IBM 029 card punch machines, and you would put a deck of cards

06:35.520 --> 06:41.480
in the machine and had a hopper that would feed one card at a time.

06:41.480 --> 06:46.520
You tap the return key to get to bring the first card into the machine where you start

06:46.520 --> 06:47.800
punching it.

06:47.800 --> 06:53.020
And as you touch the keys, it actually punched the holes in the card.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.200
So there was no such thing as a delete.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.960
I mean, there was no backspace.

06:57.960 --> 07:06.840
Once you hit the key, the hole was in the card, and if you had made a mistake, you just

07:06.840 --> 07:10.280
push return through that card away and start it again.

07:10.280 --> 07:18.800
So if you stood in the card punch room and listened a little bit, you could tell how

07:18.800 --> 07:23.560
far into the card each person was because at the beginning of a card, you'd be typing

07:23.560 --> 07:25.240
pretty quickly.

07:25.240 --> 07:30.880
But as you got to about 40 or 50 characters in, people would slow way down because they

07:30.880 --> 07:39.120
didn't want to make a mistake after having done 40 or 50 or 55 characters.

07:39.120 --> 07:43.160
And today, of course, I absolutely rely on the backspace key.

07:43.160 --> 07:48.760
If we didn't have backspace key, I'd have to do something else.

07:48.760 --> 07:55.920
I type okay, but I'm not as accurate as I would like to be.

07:55.920 --> 08:03.360
So if it wasn't for backspace, I would be much less productive in programming.

08:03.360 --> 08:10.280
But another of the really big differences, I of course started with Fortran, and in school

08:10.280 --> 08:22.880
I did Fortran, COBOL, IBM 360 and 370 assembly language, a little bit of Pascal, but not

08:22.880 --> 08:30.720
very much, and Ada wasn't really on the horizon yet, and Java hadn't even been conceived of,

08:30.720 --> 08:38.000
so never dealt with that in school.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.640
And I'm not sure how familiar you are with Fortran, but in Fortran especially, we were

08:45.640 --> 08:57.880
mostly using Fortran 66, which was the 1966 standard, and the first five spaces on a line

08:57.880 --> 09:00.920
were the line number, and you didn't have to have a line number, but that's where they

09:00.920 --> 09:02.720
went if you had one.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.040
The sixth column was the continuation column.

09:06.040 --> 09:11.360
Any character in that meant that this line was a continuation from the previous line,

09:11.360 --> 09:18.320
and everything started in column seven, and you just had to remember that.

09:18.320 --> 09:26.360
There also was no integrated development environment or language-sensitive editors or any of that.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.360
I mean, you just had to know that.

09:28.360 --> 09:40.680
And so the tools today are so much better and so friendly to, I think, especially new

09:40.680 --> 09:47.520
developers learning a new language or new developers using something like VS Code, and

09:47.520 --> 09:55.680
you install the plug-in that, you know, when you start typing the name of a function or

09:55.680 --> 10:01.640
something like that, it basically will show you a list of what could go next, and so you

10:01.640 --> 10:09.480
don't really even have to remember all of the names of everything, which is helpful,

10:09.480 --> 10:10.480
I think, to everybody.

10:10.480 --> 10:16.160
It is certainly for me because, you know, there's just so many more things available

10:16.160 --> 10:19.400
today than there were back then.

10:19.400 --> 10:28.840
In my professional life, I used DEC VAX computers, for the most part, and, you know, using the

10:28.840 --> 10:38.000
VT100 or equivalent terminals, and, you know, of course, we never used punch cards for when

10:38.000 --> 10:45.240
I was working for PAY, but I got pretty good with the editors on the VT100.

10:45.240 --> 10:51.360
They had the keypad editing, which was great, but, you know, even that could not hold a

10:51.360 --> 10:54.400
candle to the modern IDEs.

10:54.400 --> 11:02.360
I mean, you know, VS Code or the JetBrains tools or things like Eclipse or I think there's

11:02.360 --> 11:08.360
what's called NetBeans I used many years ago.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.040
They all are just great.

11:10.040 --> 11:16.360
The languages also being more available, when I first got out of school, of course, I was

11:16.360 --> 11:22.360
working eight hours a day, and then I had a computer at home and I'd come home and spend

11:22.360 --> 11:27.120
all day working, get a computer, come home, grab something to eat, and then spend three

11:27.120 --> 11:33.900
or four or five hours at night also working on a computer, but, you know, if you wanted

11:33.900 --> 11:41.080
to buy a compiler or assembler, I mean, they were, you know, a few hundred dollars each

11:41.080 --> 11:48.180
and the tools were either non-existent or very expensive, so today with, you know, things

11:48.180 --> 11:55.420
like VS Code being basically free, you can download Visual Studio if you're using it

11:55.420 --> 11:58.400
for an open source project or a personal project.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.400
You don't have to pay for that.

11:59.400 --> 12:03.360
If you're trying to learn, that's great because you can learn it without spending too much

12:03.360 --> 12:04.360
money.

12:04.360 --> 12:10.360
No, JS, you just download, Python, you just download.

12:10.360 --> 12:17.280
So the availability and quality of the tools is really one of the stark contrasts between

12:17.280 --> 12:20.200
now and, say, the mid- to late-1980s.

12:20.200 --> 12:34.760
I'm trying to think what else comes to mind that's, you know, that's a big contrast.

12:34.760 --> 12:43.200
I mean, I think computers, of course, have gotten much faster.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
Go ahead.

12:44.200 --> 12:53.520
Yeah, no, no, no, I was just thinking, like, where you mentioned the fact that in modern

12:53.520 --> 13:02.040
code editors, if you start typing, it'll show you a list of potential functions that's applicable

13:02.040 --> 13:03.040
even to the specific.

13:03.040 --> 13:09.040
It can detect what kind of object you have on the left-hand side, so it'll only suggest

13:09.040 --> 13:10.600
functions that's actually available on that.

13:10.600 --> 13:14.960
Like if it's an array, it won't suggest something that's only available on a string and that

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
kind of thing.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.720
So even that, like they're calling IntelliSense.

13:18.720 --> 13:24.760
But then over and above that, like more often than not, when you hover over one of these

13:24.760 --> 13:29.280
specific function calls or whatever, it'll show you, like, integrated documentation that's

13:29.280 --> 13:32.640
like usually pulled from MDN or something.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.840
So even that's being brought into the editor.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.800
And then I'm wondering, like, this next evolution where you get stuff like GitHub's copilot

13:40.800 --> 13:46.400
where it sometimes suggests, like, here's potentially the entire function that you probably

13:46.400 --> 13:49.640
want to write based on code analysis.

13:49.640 --> 13:56.120
What do you think about that coming into, like, it's almost like a pair programmer that's

13:56.120 --> 13:58.960
based on machine learning?

13:58.960 --> 14:02.320
I have not experienced that yet.

14:02.320 --> 14:07.160
I've read a little bit about it.

14:07.160 --> 14:12.400
That to me also, you know, a few years ago they were talking about AIs beginning to write

14:12.400 --> 14:17.200
code and, you know, they were going to be so much more efficient and effective than

14:17.200 --> 14:18.200
human programmers.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.040
But, you know, that hasn't really come to fruition.

14:22.040 --> 14:33.800
So I guess I'm a little skeptical that that's really going to come about and be a major

14:33.800 --> 14:37.240
factor.

14:37.240 --> 14:42.760
One of the things that they've also has been kind of in and out of the news over the past

14:42.760 --> 14:51.280
30, 35 years is this, you know, idea that we're going to have these libraries of reusable

14:51.280 --> 14:59.840
components and to build a system, you just grab some components, you know, write a little

14:59.840 --> 15:04.560
bit of interface code, you know, stick them together or ship them out the door.

15:04.560 --> 15:08.000
And we haven't gotten there yet either.

15:08.000 --> 15:18.080
And to me, I think the reason that that hasn't worked is because when humans solve problems,

15:18.080 --> 15:26.460
we don't always necessarily do it in a strictly procedural way by following a certain sequence

15:26.460 --> 15:27.800
of steps.

15:27.800 --> 15:37.560
We'll use intuition, which I don't know how you would teach a machine to have intuition.

15:37.560 --> 15:38.560
We use experience.

15:38.560 --> 15:45.240
You know, what has worked or not worked before?

15:45.240 --> 15:51.440
You know, we use the knowledge that we've gained and one of the things that I've always

15:51.440 --> 16:01.560
found interesting when I've had the need or the situation where I needed to use recursion,

16:01.560 --> 16:06.640
and I've written several functions in C that were recursive.

16:06.640 --> 16:13.440
And when you need a recursive function, almost nothing else will do because you think of

16:13.440 --> 16:19.960
writing this 15 or 20 line function that since it can call itself, you know, you don't need

16:19.960 --> 16:20.960
to write too much more.

16:20.960 --> 16:26.520
But if you had to write it out procedurally and do it, you know, calling a function and

16:26.520 --> 16:34.760
calling another, you know, you'd get, it would be very untenable pretty quickly.

16:34.760 --> 16:39.680
So how, you know, and how do you know when you should use recursion?

16:39.680 --> 16:43.800
Well, it's one of those things where you're trying to solve a problem, you're trying to

16:43.800 --> 16:50.120
solve a problem, and then you think, you know, this probably lends itself to a recursive

16:50.120 --> 16:52.040
function.

16:52.040 --> 16:56.720
And then you start looking at a little bit more and you start writing the recursive function

16:56.720 --> 17:05.120
and yeah, and maybe 10 or 15 or 20 lines of code, you've got this function that does this

17:05.120 --> 17:10.600
thing that you can't really keep in your mind because you can't iterate as deeply in your

17:10.600 --> 17:17.120
brain and keep everything straight as the computer can pushing stuff on the stack and,

17:17.120 --> 17:21.000
you know, just iterating and getting deeper and deeper.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.320
And one of the things that I've always been surprised at when I've written recursive functions

17:26.320 --> 17:34.000
is I never knew that I was almost done until I was done.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.600
Because I'd be writing along and it'd be kind of working and calling itself and I'd be using

17:38.600 --> 17:40.360
the debugger to watch it.

17:40.360 --> 17:45.000
And then all of a sudden I'd realize, oh, that's it, and it's finished, you know, and

17:45.000 --> 17:46.600
now it works.

17:46.600 --> 17:53.360
And you know, I just, I never really knew when I was approaching that point, whereas

17:53.360 --> 17:58.600
with other, with procedural type functions, you know, you pretty much knew, you know,

17:58.600 --> 18:02.920
when you were almost done with the function, you just had a few more things to do and you

18:02.920 --> 18:05.000
could move on and work on something else.

18:05.000 --> 18:14.800
So it's fun, but I don't, I just, I don't know how you get a machine to do that or how

18:14.800 --> 18:24.280
you create a set of components that you can pick from and without really studying it and

18:24.280 --> 18:29.440
getting into it, you know that you need a recursive component rather than just some

18:29.440 --> 18:30.800
procedural component.

18:30.800 --> 18:38.000
And that's another thing that's changed since I first started getting into computing is,

18:38.000 --> 18:43.760
you know, nobody had ever heard about object-oriented programming when I first started.

18:43.760 --> 18:49.840
So everything was very procedural, very functional, you know, you wrote functions or subroutines

18:49.840 --> 18:59.800
and Fortran and called them and, you know, you pushed arguments on the stack.

18:59.800 --> 19:04.640
So there wasn't really this concept of an object that you were working with.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.880
It was all basically arrays.

19:07.880 --> 19:16.160
And then in C, of course, C introduced the concept of the structures and the, what do

19:16.160 --> 19:23.920
they call them, where it could, it's been so long since I've written any C. There was

19:23.920 --> 19:34.080
a way to have an area in memory that if you addressed it one way, it was like one set

19:34.080 --> 19:38.040
of variables or one record format.

19:38.040 --> 19:44.360
Or if you called it by another name, it was a, I think it was a joint or join or let's

19:44.360 --> 19:47.680
join as a database thing.

19:47.680 --> 19:54.240
But you could, but depending on which name you called it by, you could use a separate

19:54.240 --> 20:01.840
set of variables within the same memory or region of memory.

20:01.840 --> 20:06.360
And that was great if you were reading records from a text file and you didn't know what

20:06.360 --> 20:08.960
the next record was going to be, you know what the different formats were.

20:08.960 --> 20:14.240
So you had five or six different possible record types and you'd read the record in,

20:14.240 --> 20:18.200
but you didn't know what type it was until you looked at the first four bytes and you

20:18.200 --> 20:22.120
say, oh, this is a, you know, this is a certain type of record.

20:22.120 --> 20:28.720
And so you would say, well, that's going to be, I'm going to call that, you know, A or

20:28.720 --> 20:29.920
whatever.

20:29.920 --> 20:34.200
And it would, then you'd use that until you get to the next record and it might be a different

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
type.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.920
And I wish I could remember what the name of that was.

20:37.920 --> 20:43.400
I'll look it up later and send you a message so that you can, maybe you can go back and

20:43.400 --> 20:47.360
edit it in or something.

20:47.360 --> 20:53.640
But object-oriented programming, and it took me a long time to get comfortable with objects

20:53.640 --> 21:06.280
because having grown up and learned in a very functional procedural manner, wrapping my

21:06.280 --> 21:11.520
brain around objects took a while.

21:11.520 --> 21:20.800
And by a while, I mean, probably a few years at least, because it just, I guess, you know,

21:20.800 --> 21:24.120
like everything else in life, you know, we have a resistance to change.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.000
So I wanted to do things the way I knew how to do with them.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.160
I didn't want to change to this new thing.

21:30.160 --> 21:33.960
But then I finally did see the light and I woke up one day and thought, yeah, this isn't

21:33.960 --> 21:34.960
so bad.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.760
Maybe I'll, maybe I'll try this after all.

21:37.760 --> 21:44.560
But those are, I think that the availability and quality of the tools, especially like

21:44.560 --> 21:50.320
you mentioned, you know, the context-sensitive editors where it can tell you what the function

21:50.320 --> 21:53.400
name could be or whatever.

21:53.400 --> 21:59.040
And object-oriented programming is different.

21:59.040 --> 22:05.160
And a year or two ago, I heard some people talking about this new thing called functional

22:05.160 --> 22:10.440
programming where they, you know, they were using subroutines and functions and I thought,

22:10.440 --> 22:13.800
yes, that's not new.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.800
That's the old way.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.800
So that was kind of interesting.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.800
Yeah, that's pretty popular in the JavaScript world.

22:20.800 --> 22:30.220
I know a lot of people are suggesting that that might be better than, because, I mean,

22:30.220 --> 22:36.340
you can fake object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

22:36.340 --> 22:42.080
And to some extent, I mean, JavaScript technically has class syntax, but it's not true class

22:42.080 --> 22:47.840
syntax, you know, in the Java sense, for example.

22:47.840 --> 22:54.880
But through that, you can sort of create this idea of classes and inheritance and all these

22:54.880 --> 22:56.120
kinds of things.

22:56.120 --> 23:04.200
And more so if you go for something like TypeScript, then you can probably get closer to true object-oriented.

23:04.200 --> 23:10.280
But I do find that a lot of folks are leaning more towards functional programming and there's

23:10.280 --> 23:18.400
some stuff built into JavaScript that lends itself to that, like your MapReduce filters,

23:18.400 --> 23:23.560
functions that you have on arrays, so you're not actually changing the underlying array.

23:23.560 --> 23:29.520
You're doing some function, you're running some functions on the contents of it and creating

23:29.520 --> 23:36.080
a new array, but the old one is still left intact.

23:36.080 --> 23:40.080
And I think that is what they call having functions that have no side effects.

23:40.080 --> 23:45.880
So if you give it the same thing, it'll always return, give you the same result, there's

23:45.880 --> 23:46.880
no surprises.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.560
So it's interesting.

23:49.560 --> 23:55.480
I think in a lot of ways, we go forward and then we step back a little bit and then we

23:55.480 --> 23:58.080
go forward and then we step back a little bit.

23:58.080 --> 24:06.360
I think the same thing happened with Jamstack where, I mean, some aspects of Jamstack is

24:06.360 --> 24:12.400
new, but the underlying idea behind it is pretty much like we used to build websites

24:12.400 --> 24:17.640
back in the early 2000s, where it's nothing more than just HTML, CSS and JavaScript that

24:17.640 --> 24:22.360
sits on a server and it's just pushed to your browser.

24:22.360 --> 24:27.000
Of course, with the modern capabilities of browsers and stuff, you have all kinds of

24:27.000 --> 24:31.440
stuff you can do then on top of that to enhance the experience, like making stuff available

24:31.440 --> 24:38.480
offline, being able to respond to different screen sizes and environments and all that

24:38.480 --> 24:39.760
kind of stuff.

24:39.760 --> 24:45.160
But the basic idea of serving static pages, that's something that happened way back in

24:45.160 --> 24:46.160
the day.

24:46.160 --> 24:49.320
And now it's again evolving.

24:49.320 --> 24:54.760
Now it seems like people are kind of still interested in Jamstack, but now they're embracing

24:54.760 --> 25:01.360
this new thing of edge functions and serverless, which I'm still trying to wrap my head around

25:01.360 --> 25:04.080
exactly what that all means.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.240
Yeah, me too.

25:06.240 --> 25:13.280
These serverless functions, I haven't really looked into that deeply.

25:13.280 --> 25:22.120
I've read a little bit about them in the context of the Microsoft Azure offerings, but I haven't

25:22.120 --> 25:23.760
really tried anything with them.

25:23.760 --> 25:28.320
But what you're talking about just a minute ago with JavaScript, we used to call that

25:28.320 --> 25:34.720
back in the day either calling something by value or by reference.

25:34.720 --> 25:41.520
If you call it by value, you change its value perhaps, or not, you don't change.

25:41.520 --> 25:47.440
If you pass by value, then you can't change the value because you don't know where it's

25:47.440 --> 25:48.440
stored in memory.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.160
So you just have to return something else.

25:50.160 --> 25:55.080
But if you pass something by reference, then you have the pointer to where it's located.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.920
So you can actually change the thing that's being passed.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.160
And I always thought that was pretty cool.

26:01.160 --> 26:07.560
But I wanted to say something about JavaScript, and I like JavaScript.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.200
I've written a fair bit of it.

26:10.200 --> 26:14.960
In fact, last year I did the, I don't know if you're familiar with the advent of code.

26:14.960 --> 26:23.920
It's a set of problems that this guy does every year for the first 25 days of December.

26:23.920 --> 26:30.440
And the problems get more and more challenging as you go through the 25 days.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.480
And there are two parts each day.

26:32.480 --> 26:39.440
And I used JavaScript last year to do that, reasonably far into it before I kind of threw

26:39.440 --> 26:45.560
my hands up and said, well, I both, A, don't have time to work on this all day long.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.200
And the problems were getting like really complicated.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.240
And I just thought, well, I'll do this again next year.

26:51.240 --> 26:56.360
But I also wanted to learn JavaScript.

26:56.360 --> 27:03.160
The more I've learned JavaScript, and you know, when you're talking about the different

27:03.160 --> 27:12.320
ways to do things in JavaScript, I'm almost always reminded of a quote that I read.

27:12.320 --> 27:23.640
I used to actually had a copy of it pinned up to my wall when I was working.

27:23.640 --> 27:28.240
I wish I still had it, but I'm paraphrasing a little bit.

27:28.240 --> 27:34.920
But the effect of the quote was when you're writing code, you're not trying to tell the

27:34.920 --> 27:37.080
computer what to do.

27:37.080 --> 27:44.200
What you're trying to do is tell other programmers what you're doing, or maybe even remind yourself

27:44.200 --> 27:50.840
six months from now why you did what you did and why you did it this way.

27:50.840 --> 28:02.960
That is so, so true because the code that I've written in C, I would do a project, get

28:02.960 --> 28:10.520
finished with it, put it away, maybe six, eight months or a year later, the guy that

28:10.520 --> 28:15.080
I wrote it for would come back and say, hey, we've got another set of data, but now we've

28:15.080 --> 28:18.000
got this different kind of quirk.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.400
And hey, can you get that code out and add it enough to do this and then process it?

28:23.400 --> 28:28.920
I did lots of what's called data reduction and analysis and processing.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.800
And so I'd say, yeah, sure, I can do that.

28:30.800 --> 28:35.320
And I would take out, I'd go find the file and edit it.

28:35.320 --> 28:45.480
And sometimes, especially early on, I would look at the code and I'd be like, who wrote

28:45.480 --> 28:46.480
this?

28:46.480 --> 28:50.920
And why do they hate me?

28:50.920 --> 28:55.800
Because it was foreign.

28:55.800 --> 29:04.320
So that encouraged me to both start writing better comments in the code and also to start

29:04.320 --> 29:12.440
doing things in really the simplest way possible.

29:12.440 --> 29:17.520
Even if there was a clever way of doing something, I would think, if I ever have to come back

29:17.520 --> 29:24.040
and look at this, am I going to be able to figure out in the future how clever I was

29:24.040 --> 29:25.360
today?

29:25.360 --> 29:31.280
Not that I'm all that clever of a person, but sometimes I would think about kind of

29:31.280 --> 29:33.560
a cool way of doing something.

29:33.560 --> 29:41.720
And in my opinion, the simplest way to get the job done, as long as it's not horribly

29:41.720 --> 29:45.640
inefficient, is probably the way you want to do it.

29:45.640 --> 29:51.040
Because when you go look at it later or if some person that's maintaining the code looks

29:51.040 --> 29:58.760
at it a year from now, they'll be able to figure out what it is you were doing relatively

29:58.760 --> 30:01.280
quickly maybe.

30:01.280 --> 30:06.840
And they'll be able to maintain it or update it or use it in a way that will be effective

30:06.840 --> 30:08.560
for them.

30:08.560 --> 30:18.160
In JavaScript, every time I look at a book on JavaScript, there really are too many different

30:18.160 --> 30:27.320
ways to do any one thing.

30:27.320 --> 30:37.680
As JavaScript has evolved, things have improved, but it used to be like the asynchronous communications

30:37.680 --> 30:38.680
with JavaScript.

30:38.680 --> 30:48.560
It was the try and catch, and then at some point they introduced the promises and I don't

30:48.560 --> 30:55.480
know what they're up to now, but you want to use the way that works the best.

30:55.480 --> 31:01.360
You don't want a lot of network congestion, but you also want to use code that's going

31:01.360 --> 31:03.720
to be understandable.

31:03.720 --> 31:13.000
And JavaScript gives you plenty of ways to just really get out there where you will never

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
come back.

31:16.000 --> 31:25.640
It's got too many ways of doing things, whereas Fortran had too few ways of doing stuff.

31:25.640 --> 31:31.800
C had about the right amount if you ask me, but then I have a special place in my heart

31:31.800 --> 31:33.800
for C language.

31:33.800 --> 31:40.360
I really enjoyed both the years, the time in my life, and C programming were all very

31:40.360 --> 31:44.680
good to me, so I remember that very fondly.

31:44.680 --> 31:50.600
Yeah, I agree.

31:50.600 --> 31:56.560
JavaScript has evolved quite a bit in the last couple of years, not all of it necessarily

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
for the better.

31:57.560 --> 32:04.600
I think there's been a lot of syntactic sugar added to the language, and I'm not always

32:04.600 --> 32:09.600
sure if it's good for new people.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.360
I think a lot of it can be super confusing.

32:12.360 --> 32:18.640
For example, you can create a function using the function keyword, but you can also create

32:18.640 --> 32:26.560
a variable and store a function in it where you use the fat arrow syntax.

32:26.560 --> 32:31.240
The thing is, it's not actually exactly the same thing.

32:31.240 --> 32:38.960
They're both functions that has a call signature that you can call, but the value of the this

32:38.960 --> 32:45.760
keyword in a function defined with the function keyword and with arrow functions is not the

32:45.760 --> 32:47.400
same.

32:47.400 --> 32:54.400
This keyword in JavaScript has been problematic in the past, and they essentially fixed it

32:54.400 --> 33:00.760
in arrow functions, but now it's important that people know the difference.

33:00.760 --> 33:06.000
In a way, they fixed it, but in a way, now you have to adopt one of the two, because

33:06.000 --> 33:10.440
otherwise you're going to potentially confuse yourself, because you're going to say, okay,

33:10.440 --> 33:16.440
cool, I could just use this dot blah, and then suddenly you're in a functions context

33:16.440 --> 33:21.200
and it doesn't work, but why the heck is it not working?

33:21.200 --> 33:27.000
It's literally just because the value of this is different, and there's some other syntactic

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
sugar things as well.

33:28.000 --> 33:34.920
I think one of the recent additions is this ability, I forget the name, but so essentially

33:34.920 --> 33:43.560
instead of having to do if this thing and then do a chain, like say if variable and

33:43.560 --> 33:48.500
variable dot something else property, then do this thing.

33:48.500 --> 33:52.600
Now you can do variable, and then you put a little question mark, and then a dot, and

33:52.600 --> 33:58.600
then the other property, and that's like a shortcut for it, and it's not always obvious

33:58.600 --> 34:01.880
what the heck that question mark does.

34:01.880 --> 34:07.520
I'm pretty sure if people new to code looks at that, it's not going to be immediately

34:07.520 --> 34:13.240
intuitive that that's actually checking, it'll only try and read the property on the right

34:13.240 --> 34:16.360
if the thing on the left exists.

34:16.360 --> 34:20.960
So if the thing on the left is undefined, it's not going to try and read the thing,

34:20.960 --> 34:25.120
so it won't throw an error saying cannot read length of undefined.

34:25.120 --> 34:30.560
You avoid that, but at the same time I'm not sure if that syntax is very intuitive, that

34:30.560 --> 34:32.560
that is what it's doing.

34:32.560 --> 34:36.160
Yeah, it's not intuitive.

34:36.160 --> 34:43.040
I know what you're talking about, and the first time I saw that I thought it's really

34:43.040 --> 34:55.120
nice that you can avoid the problems with undefined variables, but is it really better

34:55.120 --> 35:02.720
than checking to see if something is defined first and then doing it in an if statement?

35:02.720 --> 35:11.520
Is it really worth saving two lines of code to do this very kind of complex, different

35:11.520 --> 35:22.360
looking construct, and I'm not sure where I fall on that because I haven't had an occasion

35:22.360 --> 35:29.760
where I've written that type of construct yet, so I mean maybe it is, and also going

35:29.760 --> 35:38.720
back to functions, the anonymous functions in JavaScript gave me fits at first.

35:38.720 --> 35:45.040
I found them kind of difficult to construct at first and probably would have a problem

35:45.040 --> 35:50.560
with them now because I haven't written JavaScript very much recently, but my understanding is

35:50.560 --> 35:56.760
that the anonymous functions have the advantage that once they're used and they're out of

35:56.760 --> 36:04.080
scope they're no longer taking memory, which is probably a good enough rationale to use

36:04.080 --> 36:11.800
them when you can, but they certainly can be confusing.

36:11.800 --> 36:16.920
They're also hard to debug because if something happens in your code it doesn't have a name

36:16.920 --> 36:22.680
to reference because it's anonymous, right, so it can't tell you function with this name

36:22.680 --> 36:27.200
is where the error occurred, it's more going to have to try and tell you on which line

36:27.200 --> 36:32.240
it happened and then you're on your own there.

36:32.240 --> 36:37.200
Then you go back to the tried and true age old method of debugging of putting in print

36:37.200 --> 36:42.760
statements to say, okay, hey, I passed this line and now I'm at this line and now I'm

36:42.760 --> 36:50.600
at this line and this variable is now this and this and this and, you know, symbolic

36:50.600 --> 37:05.280
debuggers were also just an incredible advancement in debugging. It really beats the endless number

37:05.280 --> 37:11.240
of print statements that you have to put in to figure things out.

37:11.240 --> 37:15.840
That's true, but at the same time I wonder how approachable they are because I still

37:15.840 --> 37:22.040
find more often than not people using console.log or console.error or whatever to figure out

37:22.040 --> 37:28.720
what the heck's going on other than flipping open the developer tools and using the script

37:28.720 --> 37:38.020
debugger in there. I very rarely work with somebody that uses that as opposed to using

37:38.020 --> 37:49.040
just console.log statements. Like me myself, I mostly use console.log. I've always mean

37:49.040 --> 37:54.560
to study like these things because I know that if you know how to use it well, it's

37:54.560 --> 38:01.240
probably going to serve you better and save you time, but you need to make time to learn

38:01.240 --> 38:05.520
it because those things are pretty complex.

38:05.520 --> 38:11.880
It is. You're quite correct and I think that there's a tipping point in there that, you

38:11.880 --> 38:18.440
know, if you've got a small section of code that you're working with and you need to figure

38:18.440 --> 38:25.200
something out that's not terribly complex and you're not, you know, deep into a three

38:25.200 --> 38:30.420
or four dimensional array, yeah, putting a console.log or print statement or something

38:30.420 --> 38:39.080
like that, you know, that's kind of the first line of defense. But very quickly, if that

38:39.080 --> 38:46.360
doesn't show me where the problem is, I am much quicker these days to, you know, open

38:46.360 --> 38:54.920
the developer tools, go in there and see, you know, with Visual Studio to open the debugger

38:54.920 --> 39:01.360
and just start working through it because being able to set breakpoints and watch variables

39:01.360 --> 39:10.600
and see exactly what is in memory without having to put in statements that you then

39:10.600 --> 39:19.320
have to go back and take out or comment out is really, it's almost magical what debuggers

39:19.320 --> 39:27.360
can do today and I would say I would encourage anybody, yeah, I mean, a couple of console

39:27.360 --> 39:32.800
log statements or print statements in Python or something, you know, if that gets the job

39:32.800 --> 39:39.640
done that's fine but it's, you'll do yourself a favor if you start learning the debugging

39:39.640 --> 39:45.200
tools because they can really, not only do they, not only can they show you what the

39:45.200 --> 39:55.560
problem is but sometimes they can also illuminate other issues with the same code that you might

39:55.560 --> 40:03.880
not see until you get to a boundary condition and that, you know, that I think also is valuable.

40:03.880 --> 40:11.840
Yeah, yeah. I wonder if one of the reasons people haven't adopted these as much is maybe

40:11.840 --> 40:19.600
a lack of educational material in this area because, I mean, not that I've really dug

40:19.600 --> 40:27.100
deep for this but I haven't really that just, I mean, I see a lot of news about what's happening

40:27.100 --> 40:31.920
with the developer world and nothing like this has really come across my radar where

40:31.920 --> 40:40.120
there's this like, oh, there's this course by X on using the debugger tools in Chrome,

40:40.120 --> 40:44.040
for example, that's really amazing and you should take it and you'll never use console

40:44.040 --> 40:51.360
log again. I've never really seen that. So I wonder if that's maybe, if that's an area

40:51.360 --> 40:58.720
of opportunity in the educational space. I think you're exactly right and, you know,

40:58.720 --> 41:05.600
that's probably one of the things that the Mycelium network could help people with and,

41:05.600 --> 41:13.920
I mean, the group that you've created, I think is fantastic. It's a good idea. It's helpful

41:13.920 --> 41:24.760
to people at multiple different levels of experience and learning and, you know, that

41:24.760 --> 41:31.760
I think would be a good venue for helping people at least to start using the tools that

41:31.760 --> 41:38.840
are available and you're exactly right. Everything that I know about, especially the developer

41:38.840 --> 41:47.680
tools and Chrome or Edge or Firefox, I've learned just by poking around or I've looked

41:47.680 --> 42:00.000
on one of the, done a search on and the name is Escaping Me. It's just one of the sites

42:00.000 --> 42:03.720
where everybody goes to ask programming questions and I can't think of it.

42:03.720 --> 42:04.720
Stack Overflow?

42:04.720 --> 42:11.200
Stack Overflow, yes, indeed. You know, I'll go there and have to say, hey, how do I do

42:11.200 --> 42:16.600
a search? How do I do this? I've seldom asked questions because almost always I'm able to

42:16.600 --> 42:23.360
find somebody else's question that's very similar and I can figure it out from there.

42:23.360 --> 42:28.640
But people will say, well, if you open the developer tools and go to this pane and do

42:28.640 --> 42:35.440
this, you know, you'll see, it'll show you that. And I think, oh, that's cool. I didn't

42:35.440 --> 42:42.720
know that. So I go try it and hey, that really works well. And I kind of file that away.

42:42.720 --> 42:47.320
And the next time I need to use something like that, I hopefully remember that I can

42:47.320 --> 42:57.440
go to the developer tools and look at that. And I do that with CSS all the time. I mean,

42:57.440 --> 43:04.280
when I'm working on a website or working on CSS, I invariably have the developer tools

43:04.280 --> 43:14.160
open to the CSS that's being actually the CSS that's being applied. And, you know, being

43:14.160 --> 43:24.240
able to tweak the CSS and see the change immediately is just so much better than, you know, change

43:24.240 --> 43:34.320
it, try it, change it, try it. It's such a time saver. And I use Edge. I'm not a Microsoft

43:34.320 --> 43:43.760
fan boy. But I like Microsoft better than I did in the 80s. I tell you that. It's a

43:43.760 --> 43:52.800
different company, in my opinion, but we won't go down that road. With the Edge tools in

43:52.800 --> 44:06.880
the way that it's not really a server. It's kind of the server that you can plug in that

44:06.880 --> 44:14.320
you can get for VS code that opens Edge and runs your code in it. And I didn't know this

44:14.320 --> 44:21.280
before I did it, but I realized one day that when I was changing the CSS in the panel on

44:21.280 --> 44:27.640
the developer tools, it was actually changing it back in my source file. And so I thought,

44:27.640 --> 44:31.440
hey, that's pretty cool. If I find out what I like, I don't even have to go back. I just

44:31.440 --> 44:36.360
kind of double check, you know, look, make sure that it's there and I'm good to go. So

44:36.360 --> 44:43.880
that's, you know, we're getting there. I don't think we're at the utopia yet, but it's, things

44:43.880 --> 44:54.000
are a lot better than they were even 10 years ago or more. And my first experience with

44:54.000 --> 45:01.080
web development was in the very late 90s. You may recall that people were worried about

45:01.080 --> 45:07.680
the Y2K problem and the conversion of the dates and everything. And one of the things

45:07.680 --> 45:14.200
that I was working on was a project to make sure that, you know, we were, we were ready

45:14.200 --> 45:23.480
for Y2K. And so I developed a website to track some of the issues. And that was before JavaScript

45:23.480 --> 45:29.720
even. And, you know, there were no real databases. So those were the days of the CGI scripts.

45:29.720 --> 45:36.840
And I was writing C code and putting it in the CGI directory and then doing the calls.

45:36.840 --> 45:43.400
And I couldn't even do that today. I'd have to learn how to do it again. But it was, you

45:43.400 --> 45:49.120
know, people think, well, those were the days. Well, those were the days. But I don't want

45:49.120 --> 45:56.600
to go back there because what we have now is so much better that, you know, it's, you

45:56.600 --> 46:02.880
can, you can remember fondly that you did that. But, you know, it's like, I grew up

46:02.880 --> 46:07.960
in the, in the, in the southern part of the United States, the southeastern part. And

46:07.960 --> 46:15.440
it was fairly warm in the summertime. And for the first several years of my life, we

46:15.440 --> 46:22.360
didn't have air conditioning. And so, you know, once we got air conditioning, you know,

46:22.360 --> 46:26.760
I don't want to go back to a time without air conditioning, even though I don't, I

46:26.760 --> 46:31.960
don't live that far south now, it still gets pretty warm and somewhat humid here. So, you

46:31.960 --> 46:36.840
know, like my air conditioning, you know, I fondly remember, hey, we got, we got by

46:36.840 --> 46:41.360
without it. But I don't want to go back there.

46:41.360 --> 46:49.880
Yeah, yeah. And I do think the CSS tools are much more approachable than the JavaScript

46:49.880 --> 46:56.720
debuggers. But again, I think it's maybe just a lack of knowledge and a lack of educational

46:56.720 --> 47:02.160
material. Maybe they aren't just as approachable. It's, it's obviously a completely different

47:02.160 --> 47:08.960
paradigm. But, you know, a lot of it translates like the same way which you can see, oh, this

47:08.960 --> 47:14.160
CSS is being applied to this element. You can see, oh, at this point, this variable

47:14.160 --> 47:19.640
has this value. And I'm pretty confident you'll be able to change the value and see the impact

47:19.640 --> 47:27.360
of it in that. I think one of the tricky things with these debuggers, and again, it's probably

47:27.360 --> 47:33.840
an educational thing, but with the use of frameworks, I think oftentimes it's, it's

47:33.840 --> 47:40.600
a little tricky to avoid stepping into the code that is actually part of the framework

47:40.600 --> 47:46.800
and being completely lost. And then having to dig your way out of the framework code

47:46.800 --> 47:52.160
back to where it's, again, the code that you wrote to get to the problem. But again, you

47:52.160 --> 47:57.760
know, because you have step into, step over, and all those kinds of things. So it's understanding

47:57.760 --> 48:04.040
when do you want to step into, when do you want to step over, so that you avoid drilling

48:04.040 --> 48:12.080
into the stuff. But with that said, I do know that the Chromium dev tools have this ability

48:12.080 --> 48:20.040
to exclude certain libraries. So you can say, by the way, anything that's like jQuery, don't

48:20.040 --> 48:26.400
go there. So if something is, would have stepped into the jQuery code, it'll just step over

48:26.400 --> 48:27.400
it instead.

48:27.400 --> 48:35.640
Oh, that's cool. Yeah. But again, I was going to say, I remember back in the late 80s, I

48:35.640 --> 48:41.080
was doing something with the Visual Studio and I was doing some debugging and I accidentally

48:41.080 --> 48:49.080
stepped into one of the dynamic league libraries and windows. And I was immediately, you know,

48:49.080 --> 48:55.480
I had no idea what I was looking at. And then of course, I didn't have the symbols for that.

48:55.480 --> 49:01.760
So it was all just basically Greek. So basically, I started again and made sure I stepped over

49:01.760 --> 49:06.840
the next time. But yeah, you're exactly right on that.

49:06.840 --> 49:18.320
Yeah. So to switch it up a little bit, I read that you are really into cars, automobiles.

49:18.320 --> 49:27.080
And I know recently you've gotten into motorcycles. But the one thing that I, when reading the

49:27.080 --> 49:33.200
history that you have on one of your blogs, the one thing that's been common throughout

49:33.200 --> 49:42.520
that entire line is you would always join these automobile clubs. And I mean, automobile

49:42.520 --> 49:50.300
clubs are essentially communities. So I wonder with that in mind, like, what does community

49:50.300 --> 49:56.920
mean to you? And what led you to this, this, this, what can you call it, this pattern of

49:56.920 --> 50:02.540
always reaching out, always searching out for a community around the specific interest

50:02.540 --> 50:08.760
that you have? Well, let me tell you what I think community

50:08.760 --> 50:18.440
means to me is a group of people that have some common interest or common bond and are

50:18.440 --> 50:27.000
willing to both share their knowledge and excitement with others and also help others

50:27.000 --> 50:35.280
who maybe don't have as much experience or haven't lived through some of the early part

50:35.280 --> 50:42.160
of like, say, cars in the 60s and 70s being different from today, for example, to help

50:42.160 --> 50:50.320
them along to understand maybe some of the changes or whatever. So it's really a community

50:50.320 --> 50:59.360
to me as a group of people who are all interested in some topic, helping each other to understand

50:59.360 --> 51:12.600
it better and move forward either individually or as a group to improve the topic, if you

51:12.600 --> 51:21.200
will, if that's doable, or just to enhance each other's enjoyment of a particular brand

51:21.200 --> 51:30.900
of car, type of car. And in the tech industry, being able to ask questions and learn from

51:30.900 --> 51:37.880
people who have done things, then you need to do this and you're interested in learning

51:37.880 --> 51:47.160
how to do it. But, you know, a lot of the documentation, and I'll use Git and GitHub

51:47.160 --> 51:56.560
as an example, the documentation can be both very accurate and very unapproachable at the

51:56.560 --> 52:04.920
same time. I mean, when I go back and read some of the documentation that I read a long

52:04.920 --> 52:10.680
time ago, now it makes sense, but now I know how to do what it's talking about. And so

52:10.680 --> 52:18.880
recently I asked you, how do I do this? And you were very gracious and walked me through

52:18.880 --> 52:25.120
how to do this thing that I was trying to do. And I had looked at the documentation

52:25.120 --> 52:31.400
and it just didn't, it just, I couldn't figure out, it didn't make sense. I didn't know

52:31.400 --> 52:39.200
why, how to put the steps together or what the motivation for doing that was. But having

52:39.200 --> 52:46.080
somebody who has experienced that and is willing to say, well, you do it this way because of

52:46.080 --> 52:56.000
this and here is the, I think, workflow or the flow of anything is not immediately apparent

52:56.000 --> 53:01.360
when you're working on something that's new to you. You don't see the overall

53:01.360 --> 53:08.440
picture. You see the piece of it that you're working on right now. And so having somebody

53:08.440 --> 53:15.600
that understands the whole subject or all of the workflow is just invaluable. And I

53:15.600 --> 53:23.360
think that's part of being part of a community. And the reason that I always, the reason that

53:23.360 --> 53:31.280
I personally, just for me, seek out those types of communities is because as an extreme

53:31.280 --> 53:43.440
introvert, I just, I have no ability to engage in small talk. I mean, it just exhausts me

53:43.440 --> 53:51.080
trying to chat with people about nothing. I mean, I've gone to parties that didn't

53:51.080 --> 53:56.480
really have a theme or anything that everybody was interested in. It was just, hey, let's

53:56.480 --> 54:02.280
get together and have a party. And after about 10 minutes, I'm thinking, well, I could be

54:02.280 --> 54:10.560
doing something else. And it's just, no, we're not talking about anything that I'm interested

54:10.560 --> 54:22.200
in. So I'm just going to leave now. So in order to have a community, I seek out people

54:22.200 --> 54:30.520
that I share a common interest with. And of course, the more interest that I share with

54:30.520 --> 54:36.840
a person or a group of people, the better that is, because that gives me more points

54:36.840 --> 54:45.280
of connection if you want to look at it that way. And so that has been, the internet age

54:45.280 --> 54:52.600
has really been a good thing for me because I've been able to connect with folks who I

54:52.600 --> 55:00.640
would never have known if it weren't for some group. And the way that I first got exposed

55:00.640 --> 55:07.960
to Discord, one of the things that I do, I play some video games on both consoles and

55:07.960 --> 55:16.640
PC. But I play Final Fantasy XIV off and on. I'm not on every day. But when I got to a

55:16.640 --> 55:21.800
certain point in that, I wasn't making much progress because I wasn't sure what to do

55:21.800 --> 55:26.120
next. So I kind of sought out a community. And somebody said, well, why don't you join

55:26.120 --> 55:30.040
this Discord server? And there's a bunch of people there. And I thought, well, I don't

55:30.040 --> 55:37.160
even know what Discord is. So I looked it up and signed up and joined the server. And

55:37.160 --> 55:45.120
the folks there were great. I put a question. And within minutes, usually, somebody had

55:45.120 --> 55:50.880
said, well, you should maybe look at this or try this or whatever. And I went from not

55:50.880 --> 56:00.720
having any idea what to do to having almost too much information on it. And so that's

56:00.720 --> 56:08.520
kind of the other side of the coin. But the communities that I've been able to find on

56:08.520 --> 56:21.880
the internet in general, but Discord specifically, have been quite helpful. Also, as an introvert,

56:21.880 --> 56:33.560
it allows me to control the amount of interaction. So if I get to a point where I'm just, I can't

56:33.560 --> 56:39.240
do it anymore, I can sort of walk away from the computer or just stop reading it for a

56:39.240 --> 56:47.880
little while. And it allows me to read something, read an answer that somebody's provided, and

56:47.880 --> 56:53.000
then think about that. And it's asynchronous. I don't have to respond right away. I can

56:53.000 --> 56:59.520
take my time to internalize it, think about it, decide what my approach is or what my

56:59.520 --> 57:09.040
thought is, and then I can reply if it's necessary. So that has been very good. Whereas in a face

57:09.040 --> 57:19.880
to face meeting or communication, and I'm not against that. I can do that. It's just,

57:19.880 --> 57:27.720
I'm sure you've been in meetings where all but one person in the meeting, it's clear

57:27.720 --> 57:32.480
that we're done, it's time to go, we're finished with this. There's this one person

57:32.480 --> 57:44.120
who just keeps, they just can't stop. And so that I find really frustrating. So I can

57:44.120 --> 57:55.280
do the in-person meetings, but in in-person meetings, people tend to expect a response

57:55.280 --> 58:05.440
pretty quickly. And I don't always have a response quickly, especially if it's a question

58:05.440 --> 58:12.000
or something that I need to think about for a while. And so online communities are just

58:12.000 --> 58:16.760
great for that because I can look at something, read it, and somebody's got a question, I

58:16.760 --> 58:23.720
think, well, I kind of understand what they want, but I'm not sure how to phrase it. So

58:23.720 --> 58:29.160
I'll go away for a while and it sits in the back of my mind. And then later on, I'll come

58:29.160 --> 58:35.800
back and say, oh, yeah, this is the way I want to put this. And I type the message to

58:35.800 --> 58:43.600
them and it makes sense and it helps them. And that's wonderful. I enjoy helping people

58:43.600 --> 58:50.400
and I want to help be as good to people and help them as much as I can. But sometimes

58:50.400 --> 58:55.680
I have to have to think about how to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Not for sure. No, I completely

58:55.680 --> 59:02.640
understand it. I also like the asynchronous means of communication. I had it in a meeting

59:02.640 --> 59:11.200
if somebody puts you on the spot to estimate a timeline or to give an answer to something.

59:11.200 --> 59:16.520
It's like, don't put me on the spot like that. I need to think about this. Otherwise, I'm

59:16.520 --> 59:26.640
going to say something and then I'm going to probably regret it. And at some of these,

59:26.640 --> 59:30.520
for one of the clients that I've worked for a long time, they have these all hands meetings

59:30.520 --> 59:38.400
where everybody comes together. And I oftentimes have to excuse myself and go to my hotel room

59:38.400 --> 59:45.080
just for a while, just to decompress because I can only social so much and then I need

59:45.080 --> 59:51.360
to decompress. Well, and the more people you have in a room at the same time, especially

59:51.360 --> 59:58.880
a meeting about something, the more avenues of communication you have. So you're trying

59:58.880 --> 01:00:06.120
to deal with all of that. You're trying to maintain the lines of communication to each

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.680
of the other people in the room. And when you have too many people, you just really

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:21.360
can't do that. So they used to, one of the projects that I was on, they used to have

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:27.760
these like week long meetings. I mean, they would get people from all over the place and

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:34.920
we'd sit in a big conference room and there'd probably be 40 or 45 people in there. And

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:44.840
it was just all day long for all week. And so little would get done because everybody

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:55.400
wanted to have their voice heard and put their two cents in. And I thought if you would just

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:03.720
break this down into its component issues and then have the people meet that have a

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:10.720
vested interest in that issue, get those people together, the three or four or five of them,

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:16.600
let them hash it out for an hour or so, they'll come up with a solution. But in a room of

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:30.600
40 people, it's really difficult to do that. And then somebody had in another project,

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:36.640
they had an epiphany. I said, hey, when we have meetings, we're not going to sit down.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:43.440
We're going to stand up during the whole meeting. And that kind of focused people's thoughts

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:48.960
because instead of sitting there eating donuts and drinking coffee, they're standing there

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:56.120
and people get tired of kind of standing up doing nothing. So that was helpful. So being

01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:07.680
able to focus is an art form in some sense. And it's necessary to get real work done.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:13.000
I mean, if you just want to stand around and chat for a while, that's fine. But if you

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.640
want to solve a problem, you need to focus on the problem, get inputs from people who

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.220
are stakeholders who have a vested interest in that problem, and then find something that

01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:34.000
will work for the majority or all of those people. And large meetings make that difficult.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:46.720
That's for sure. So when you talked about how things have improved in terms of the languages

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.640
that's available to us, the tooling that's available to us, and how the industry has

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:56.680
moved on and how you used to be able to work. I also think about stuff like in the past,

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:02.160
if you wanted to learn something, you had to go to the bookstore and buy a book and

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:08.380
they were very expensive. Unless you had a library that had a really good collection

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:15.120
of books, you pretty much you had to save up and go buy that book. These days, of course,

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.160
that's almost unheard of. You just do a quick search and you find a thing or you find an

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:28.800
online course or you use institutions like Stanford with their open curriculum and the

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:37.640
access to information is just incredible. But with all of that, I saw you mention in

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:46.840
one of your posts about the movie Hidden Figures. And what's been highlighted in there is this

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.840
role that women and underrepresented people actually played in something as monumental

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:59.480
as the moon landing and all of these kinds of things. So I'm wondering, with all of this

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:07.160
improvement that's happened, do you think the quality of software has actually improved

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:13.840
in step with all these other improvements that we've had? And secondly, in general,

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:20.080
do you think that the tech industry has really improved as much as you would have thought

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:27.480
it would seeing that we have had all of these underlying enhancements and improvements to

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:33.520
the way we work and the languages and the tools we have access to?

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:44.240
I think software, the quality of software in general has improved. It still got a ways

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:52.880
to go, but some of the testing approaches that are being used now, I think, are making

01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:00.840
software more reliable than it was. And I mean, the thing that I would point to on that

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:15.000
is the difference between, let's say, Windows 3 and Windows 11. And I remember Windows version

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:22.640
3 and 3.311 specifically, because that was the one where they added the networking capability.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:30.800
But it was probably multiple times a day. I was doing a hard reset on the machine. I

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.280
was doing a hard reset on the machine because it got into some state where it was no longer

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:41.360
paying any attention to the mouse or anything. So if you can reach the big red switch, you

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:49.400
turn it off, wait a second, turn it back on, and start over. And that does occasionally

01:05:49.400 --> 01:06:04.000
still happen, but not nearly at the rate that it did in the mid-90s. I would say these days,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:12.360
I mean, my primary machine stays on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I mean, I log out, close

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:19.400
the lid of a laptop, turn the monitor off at night. But it'll run for sometimes weeks

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:25.480
at a time. And the only reason I rebooted is because there's an update that requires

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:34.040
a reboot. So I think things, the quality of some software has improved. It's not really

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:40.040
consistent across the board. Some shops have done a much better job at improving their

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:48.960
quality than others. But yeah, that's just the human condition. I mean, some brands of

01:06:48.960 --> 01:07:00.520
automobiles are much more reliable than others. So that's just kind of the way things work.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:14.640
As far as making progress in treating people more equitably and having a wider representation

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:35.520
of people in the field, I wish we had made more progress in that. I have worked with

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:42.960
all different types of people from all ethnic backgrounds, lots of people who did not speak

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:56.760
English as a native language. One of the projects I was on, I traveled to Germany multiple times

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:03.160
a year for two or three weeks at a time and saw the difference between the culture here

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:19.520
and the culture there. And you realize pretty quickly that you have to give people grace.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:26.720
When you go somewhere else, you're necessarily going to be in a different environment. And

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:38.280
so you have to be open to differences from what you're used to. And the think tank that

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:49.400
I worked for was an interesting place to work because like 95% of the folks there, the staff

01:08:49.400 --> 01:09:00.080
members had at least one PhD, sometimes more than that. And almost all of them were in

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:06.040
what I call, and I think most people would refer to as the hard sciences. We had lots

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:17.440
of physicists, lots of astrophysicists, mathematicians, statisticians, chemical engineers, that type

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:40.560
of thing. And it was mostly white males. But we also had people of color and not only black

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:49.360
and brown people, but also Asians. And I mean, pretty much a little bit of everything. We

01:09:49.360 --> 01:10:04.280
had women who worked there. And I just always try to treat people like I would want to be

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:20.000
treated. And I try to just look, they're a person, they're an individual. And be as accommodating

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:32.480
as I can and help them out and not be mean or evil or whatever. And I think that has

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:44.280
to do with the way that I was raised, more than a conscious decision to be that way.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:53.960
As I mentioned, I grew up in the deep southeast in the United States in the late 50s and 60s.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:11:03.240
I'll live through a lot of the stuff that went on during that time. But my father was

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:09.720
a civilian employee at a military base. He was civil service and worked as a civilian

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:18.480
on a military base. And he was dealing with mostly non-commissioned officers like sergeants

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:27.000
and things like that. And they came from all over the place. And so, you know, often at

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Thanksgiving, he would say he would invite one or two of them to come have Thanksgiving

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.840
with us, because they were in a situation where they couldn't go back to where they

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:46.440
were from. So we would have people from different ethnicities and different backgrounds. And

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:57.640
sometimes radically different belief systems than us. And my parents just always treated

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:07.120
them the same as they would treat family. And so I just kind of grew up thinking that

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:16.400
this is the way you treat people. You treat them with compassion and if they need something

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:25.880
you try to help them. And, you know, when I got kind of into the real world and realized

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:37.320
that not everybody does that, I was saddened by that because, you know, there's no reason

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:50.440
for it. I think we need to give people the chance to excel to whatever level they are

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:59.720
able to, given their intellectual capacity and their determination, their interest, their

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:07.560
motivation. I mean, you know, people are all different. And, you know, a lot of people

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:18.800
are a lot smarter than me and a lot more successful. And hey, that's great. But, you know, I don't

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:25.760
fault them for that, because they haven't tried to prevent me from being what I wanted

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:36.280
to be. And so in turn, I try to never prevent anyone from attaining what they want to attain.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:40.040
And if I can help them get there, I'm going to do that. I mean, one of the things that

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:45.080
I learned from my father, who was a good man, was that if you can help somebody, you do

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:51.160
it. You don't pay attention to what color their skin is or what they believe in or where

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:58.400
they came from or, you know, what sex they are or whatever. If you can help somebody,

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:08.600
you help them, you know. And he did that his entire life. And so I hope that I am like

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:15.800
that. I want to think that I am. I try to be. And so I think if we would all be that

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:23.960
way, maybe the world would be a little better. Yeah, yeah, that's beautiful. I totally agree.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:29.560
And I can say from what I've from the interactions I've had with you and seen you have with others

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:34.600
on the Mycelium Network, you're definitely following in the footsteps of your father.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:46.280
So you can rest assured of that. Yeah. So I also read your blog where you're detailing

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:53.480
your journey of getting back into the tech world and specifically web development. And

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.480
you had this kind of mantra of sorts that you wrote that I really liked. And what you

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:03.480
wrote was, start with the basics, be consistent, write some code every day, and stay focused.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:10.840
I think that's tremendous advice that I would echo to anybody that's getting into any industry,

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:16.800
really. But especially like in coding, that is definitely something great. So how's your

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:22.120
journey been so far, getting back into the industry and specifically this web development

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:31.040
industry? Well, if I could follow my own advice, I'd probably be doing better. But it's one

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:42.680
of those things where you know what you should do, but the distance between knowing what

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:53.440
you should do and doing it is that there's not always an easy path. And so I would say,

01:15:53.440 --> 01:16:02.000
I love programming. I mean, I could, you know, when I get immersed in a programming problem

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.960
and project, you know, I can start and I think it's been five minutes and it's really been

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.920
five hours. And it's just, you know, it's like no time has passed. And I'm sure you

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:30.040
have experienced that. But during my career, I got pulled into different aspects of computing

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:40.000
and I'll use computing in a very broad sense. So that, you know, after probably five or

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:49.440
six or seven years of really writing Fortran or C pretty much all day, every day, I got

01:16:49.440 --> 01:17:00.640
into, well, we need somebody to, you know, create a database. And so at the time, I think

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:07.200
Ingress was one of the databases that was available on the VAX. And, you know, so I

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:13.360
would learn the language for that and started, you know, designing things and creating tables

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:21.360
and relations and all that. So that that was sort of like programming, but not really.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.920
And then I started getting pulled into some like system administration type stuff. And

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:35.520
I started running some, well, they used to refer to them as workstations like silicon

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.880
graphics. We had a couple of silicon graphics workstations, you know, the high end graphics

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:46.200
workstations. We had a couple of HP, you know, workstations running HP's version of Unix.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:52.080
And so I got into that and that was that was less like programming. But, you know, these

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:57.440
people were paying me to show up and do what they needed me to do. So they said, we need

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.880
you to do this. So I did, I did what they needed me to do. And then it kind of went

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:15.880
from there. And I got into doing some what would now be called cyber security. They actually

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:20.760
sent me to, I don't know if you're familiar with the SANS Institute. You can look them

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:28.800
up on sans.org. But I've taken, you know, they paid for and sent me to take like five

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:38.160
or six of their different courses. And, you know, security is necessary. And it's, it's

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:45.880
a little bit interesting, but it's not coding. So over the years, I got away from programming.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:50.080
And that's, I mean, that's, that's, that's why I got into this to start with. I mean,

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:55.240
I went, I told you, I went to that Fortran course and I thought, yeah, this is great

01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:01.120
stuff. And I started, you know, banging out code. And, and, you know, you'd run, you'd

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:07.480
go to the card reader and read your deck in and you'd wait, I don't know, an hour, hour

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.720
and a half or 45 minutes or whatever it was, depending on how busy the computer was. And

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.960
then you'd, your printout would come out and you'd see the listing and then the error message.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:20.600
Oh, I got, you know, so I got to go back and change this and change. And then when it finally

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:27.160
runs, it's like annihilation, you know, it's, it's a, it's a, it's one of those small successes.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:35.040
And I, you know, I, that, that, um, I, I really enjoy that. I, I, I like to have, have code

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.640
that I've written and run it and see that it works. And man, that's just great. So when

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:49.160
I, uh, when I basically retired, um, from full-time work and I kind of, I also had a

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:54.120
business on the side doing IT management for small businesses in the, in the area where

01:19:54.120 --> 01:20:03.320
I live. Um, you know, doing network administration and server administration and updates and

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:10.680
you know, all that good stuff. Um, and so I finally got most of those clients transition

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:16.920
to other providers and I was able to stop doing that. And I thought, well, now I can

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:23.240
get back to, to coding. I want to, I want to write some code. And at the time I looked

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:27.840
around and thought, well, you know, writing code today pretty much means websites. You

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:35.160
know, it's, it's either, you know, WordPress plugins or themes or something of that nature.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:43.920
Um, but, but it was, it had changed so much from the last time I had done that, that type

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:53.200
of thing that I was faced with this just overwhelming number of options. Um, and you mentioned your

01:20:53.200 --> 01:21:01.680
frameworks and not only frameworks, but languages and, um, you know, WordPress versus Joomla

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:10.280
versus, you know, roll your own website. And, um, uh, you know, what is it? My SQL versus

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:20.680
Maria DB versus no SQL databases or, you know, and so it's, uh, it's kind of a bewildering,

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:29.320
um, uh, landscape of possibilities. And so I thought, you know, that that's where I thought,

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:34.480
you know, I got to, I've got to concentrate on the basics. I need to, I need to figure

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:43.800
out what is the kind of basic set of, of, uh, of, um, software and skills that I need

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:49.960
to work on to be able to do this. And that, you know, to me that turns out to be HTML

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:58.720
five, CSS three, uh, and JavaScript. And then, um, my SQL typically is, is very available

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:06.800
on most, uh, um, uh, web service, you know, web server providers. So those, that's what

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:14.500
I sort of started concentrating on. And then of course, PHP is, is easy, uh, to get access

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:20.360
to also, uh, because so many sites are running WordPress. Um, so, you know, PHP is almost

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:30.000
always available. And, uh, so I, it, it, I, I had to really, um, kind of figure out what

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:38.240
pieces I wanted to start with because I was fairly familiar with HTML back in the early

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:45.280
days. Um, but that, that has changed with HTML five. They've added new, uh, new tags

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:53.320
and you know, it's better, but it's a little more to know. Um, and then CSS, I mean, I

01:22:53.320 --> 01:23:03.000
was using inline, uh, styling, uh, back in the late nineties, early two thousands. Um,

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:10.960
but you know, CSS and now with, uh, CSS being able to import, you know, other, uh, CSS files

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:18.280
that that's, that's a good thing. And so it's been, it's been a journey. Um, but yeah, I

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:26.360
mean, trying to, trying to stay focused on the basics is also kind of difficult though,

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:31.800
because you know, you, you're here about some, you know, cool new technology and you want

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:35.520
to go look at it and kind of say, well, how could I incorporate this and what can I do

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:42.400
with it? Cause it, it's so new and it's shiny and you know, um, and so you want to do that.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:50.040
So I, it's, it's a, it's a challenge to really stay focused. Um, it, it's also a, a terrible

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:56.680
challenge to, to write some code every day. I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll say, okay,

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:59.920
I gotta, I gotta start coding. I will write some every day and I'll, I'll do that for

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:07.320
a while. And then there'll be something that happens. I mean, life happens, you know, there'll

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:12.880
be something that I have to go do one day and I can't get to my coding that day. And

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:17.680
when you miss one day, then it's easy to miss another day. And pretty soon you haven't coded

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:24.840
anything in two weeks. And, um, so it's, it's, it's been challenging, but it's, it's also

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:33.600
been a, it's been fun because, um, I am fortunate enough not to have to do it as a, as a money

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:40.680
making proposition. I mean, with, with my, my wife's retirement, my retirement or social

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:46.920
security and stuff like that, you know, we're, we're not rich by any stretch of the imagination,

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:52.800
but we're, you know, we're, we're okay. And so, you know, I'm at the, I'm at the point

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.520
where if I say, yeah, I just don't want to do anything to almost sit around and read

01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:02.000
or, you know, just go to the park, take a walk or go to the beach or whatever. I can

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.920
do that. Um, and you know, a lot of, and I, I realized a lot of people, most people aren't

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:16.960
in that situation. Um, so I, and believe me, I, I realize I've, you know, I've, I've got

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:26.760
it pretty good. Um, but I still, I still try to maintain, um, some, uh, some momentum and

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:32.080
some motivation because, you know, if it, there's nothing else to keep me motivated

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:40.960
right now other than either my self motivation or if somebody says, Hey, I, I, I, I'm having

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.880
a problem with this. I don't, don't know how to do it. Or I, I don't know how to write

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:49.720
this function to do this thing. Um, can you give me a hand? And that, that gives me a

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:57.440
specific thing to work on. And I, I find that to be much easier than, than to find internal

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:04.280
motivation to do it. That's why I told you last year, I did the, the advent of code and

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:09.280
this it's an every year thing. The guy doesn't does it every year. And I'll probably do that

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:15.680
again this December to, um, you know, to, to focus my efforts on, I'll probably use

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:22.820
JavaScript again, using node JS, uh, to do that, um, to, to hone some of those skills

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:28.760
and to, to try to improve, uh, in that, that area, because that, that gives me a very good

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:34.080
focal point. Maybe I use Python this year. Anyway, I haven't decided, but you get the

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:43.120
idea. Um, it's, it's, it's a, it's a way to maintain, um, focus and motivation without

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:49.280
having to continually come up with something new. And that, that, that's the challenges

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:55.360
is finding something interesting to do. Yeah. I know for sure that it's something I need

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.840
as well. I, I can't just, I think I've mentioned it a couple of times from some of the other

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.760
podcast episodes. Like I can't just learn something for the sake of learning it. I need

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:11.080
an outlet. I need an outlet for it. Um, otherwise I either lose interest or I go down rabbit

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:18.600
holes that doesn't serve me in any way. Um, so I totally get that. So, um, in closing,

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:26.520
I know you've mentioned that you, uh, collect coffee cups and now I partially know why you

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:32.720
do that because you also love coffee. So what is it that you like about coffee and what

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:42.280
is some of your favorite coffees? Um, I like everything about coffee. Uh, I like the aroma

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:49.400
of the uncooked or the, you know, the, the aroma of the ground beans. Uh, I love the

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:56.600
aroma of the coffee while it's brewing. Um, I actually liked the taste of coffee. I know

01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:07.200
a lot of people don't. Um, I just, I, I, I enjoy the warmth of the drink itself. Um,

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:16.120
I enjoy the, um, the activity that surrounds coffee. I mean, we, we, my wife and I live

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:21.560
on a small lake and we have a patio that, uh, with the back of our house faces the lake

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:27.000
and we have this nice patio that's covered and on nice days, uh, we have a table and

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:34.200
chairs there. We can take a cup of coffee out and, um, talk about life, the universe

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:41.720
and everything or, you know, uh, you know, read a book or whatever and have a cup of

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:49.800
coffee and it's just, it's just really nice. Um, I, I, I tell you what the coffee that

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:55.600
we're buying right now is from a small roaster. I think they're in California. It's called

01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:05.040
Angelino's coffee and it's a, it's a family owned and run. Uh, I think they do everything

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.640
from, from, from, I mean, I think they grow their own beans and everything from there

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:18.640
to the finished ground product. Um, and the reason that we're using them now, rather than

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:25.440
I was buying a lot of caribou coffee, which is a larger, um, um, manufacturer, I think

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:33.080
the space in Canada. Um, I was using caribou and I like, and I like their coffees a lot,

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:40.120
but we had, we switched to the Keurig machine a couple of years ago, two or three, probably

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:45.320
more than that. Now I have, uh, I've gotten to the point where caffeine upsets, uh, my

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:51.600
heart rhythm. So I've, I've had to switch to decaf coffee and my, my wife still drinks

01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:57.360
calf fully caffeinated coffee. And so, um, rather than making a pot, we, we have our

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:03.920
own coffee pods and a caribou Creek for a while was, was great, but then they were,

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:11.000
their availability of their K cup, uh, blends was, was kind of spotty. Um, green mountain

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.000
makes makes, uh, is, is a, makes pretty good coffee, but we always try to get the, the

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.680
dark roast. We, we prefer the darker, uh, roast coffees. Um, and, uh, basically anything

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:31.600
from Kona in Hawaii, uh, you know, anything that comes from there is going to be good

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:39.240
coffee, uh, Colombian, the Colombian coffees. But, but I, with, with our, with the coffee,

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:46.800
um, that we buy, I, I take the same approach with that as I try to do with anything else

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:54.200
that I can, I try to support small, uh, businesses, either local or, or a family owned business

01:30:54.200 --> 01:31:00.360
that somewhere else is selling over the internet. Um, you know, the, the, the individual entrepreneur

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:06.800
and their, their family, I think that's, I like to try to support those people to, you

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:13.520
know, to encourage them to continue. And as an encouragement to other, you know, would

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:19.520
be entrepreneurs to, you know, to, to try whatever it is that they're interested in

01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:26.360
and, and provide that. I mean, I think too, too many people just, you know, go to Walmart

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:31.600
or, or whatever the local, you know, big store is and, and buy everything. And they don't

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:38.680
think about, um, how that affects the small businesses and the small business owner and

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:46.000
the families that have been, and that have been doing something for generations. And

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.200
now they're, they're basically priced out of the market because somebody comes along

01:31:51.200 --> 01:32:00.800
that can do it, you know, 3% cheaper. And a lot of people only think about the cost

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:06.440
to them to buy this, to buy whatever it is they need. And they don't, they don't think

01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:14.920
about, you know, the effect on the larger world and, and putting some of these people

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:21.480
out of business or, or, or, you know, their families not being able to, to make a living

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:27.480
from this family business has been in the family for generations and now they have to

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:34.120
do something else. So I really, it's not always possible, but whenever, whenever I can, I

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:41.120
try to support a small business. And I think Angelina's, I don't have, I don't own stock

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.640
in them. I don't have any, I don't have any, you know, advertiser relationship with them

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:54.600
or anything like that, but I like their coffee. Um, their website works really well. Um, it's,

01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:01.440
it's easy to order and it tastes good. And, uh, so we're, for the time being, we're sticking

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:08.800
with them. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. I'm also, um, I've also had to switch to Decaf, um,

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:16.680
for similar reasons. Um, for me, it's an anxiety thing. Like it, if, uh, the coffee is a little

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:22.840
too strong, uh, it does make your heart beat faster and that, that can make you anxious

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:28.000
if you're prone to, to being anxious. Um, but yeah, I think that there is definitely

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.840
something special about coffee. Um, and like you said, the whole ritual of, like not instant

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:41.400
coffee. Like that's okay, but I know I, I like the ritual of, like, I'd like to buy

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:47.520
the beans and I have like a proper burr grinder. And so I like the sound of it when it grounds

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:52.200
the beans and you have to just find the right setting, um, play around with the settings

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:56.320
until you find the right thing. And there's so many different ways to brew a cup also.

01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.200
Like, you can have like a Keurig machine, you can have drip coffee, you can have like

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:07.080
French press. It's really interesting. Um, yeah, I'm also a coffee lover myself. Um,

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:13.080
and I'm glad I, I, I'm very glad that decaf exists because I wouldn't want to have to

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:19.720
give up coffee at all. And, um, yeah, we have some companies in South Africa that, um, do

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:25.760
the fair trade thing. Um, so therefore, you know, that, uh, everybody in the chain of

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:31.760
getting the coffee to you is being paid fairly. And I definitely do opt to, to, to support

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:38.160
them over, uh, just buying some big brand at the grocery store. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:43.640
Yeah. We, we used to grind our own, um, back when we could both drink coffee with caffeine

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:50.720
in it. Um, and I've, I've, I've used French presses. Uh, I enjoy that. Um, I've got a

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:56.520
little, uh, well, I call it the one cup drip coffee maker. Uh, it's, it's actually a little

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.760
cone shaped thing that fits on top of a cup of coffee and you put the coffee in and pour

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:07.000
boiling water through. So I've, I've tried all of them. I still like real perked coffee

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.800
the best. I mean, in an old fashioned percolator and I don't have one anymore. The last one

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:19.200
that I had just stopped working. It was electric and I haven't tried to find another one, but

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:30.120
that, but it, uh, I will, I will, uh, say this and, um, as, as kind of a winding down

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:38.000
the, uh, URL of my main website is slow lane cafe. And that's the, that's, I have my email

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.280
address there. I've owned that domain since sometime in the early to mid nineties. I mean,

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.840
I registered it when that first, when you could first start registering domains. And

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:56.600
I chose that because I, I, I, I want to live life, not in the fast lane. I'd like to live

01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:02.600
in the slow lane. And when we travel, we often will take side roads and, you know, just try

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:09.240
to find, and I think of living life in the slow lane and stopping at little roadside

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:15.320
cafes to have a cup of coffee. I mean, that's just kind of the whole, um, the whole reason

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:21.880
that I came up with that as a domain name. And, uh, and I, I probably will have that

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:27.760
until, uh, I am no longer here. And then it will live on. But that, that, that's how that

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:34.520
came. Yeah. I said, then, then it will live on even when you're not around anymore for

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:41.360
other people to be inspired. I hope so. Yeah, no, I'm sure. Well, thanks so much, Andy.

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.440
This was, this is a lovely conversation. I really enjoyed it. I knew it was going to

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:51.320
be a good one. That's why I pushed you to do it. And, um, so I'm truly grateful. Thank
