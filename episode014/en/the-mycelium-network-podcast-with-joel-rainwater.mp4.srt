Welcome to the Marsilian Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,840
Hey Joel, welcome to the Marsilian Network Podcast.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,040
Hey, yeah, thanks for having me.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,040
Super excited to be here.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,040
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,720
So I always ask people to write a short introduction in the doc.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,000
The idea is that I'll put it in the show notes eventually.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,480
I used to read them out, but then I thought, no, I don't want to be the person telling

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
your story.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,640
You should tell your story.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,160
But what I like about the one that you wrote here is it's going to lead us into my first

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,640
question because you say you're a software developer who's gone from building really

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,000
basic HTML and CSS websites to being a fractional CEO of a startup and a whole lot in between.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,280
So can you tell us about that whole lot in between?

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,600
Wow, that's a lot.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,160
Yeah, I mean, so like I said, I'm self-taught.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,160
I started playing around with code when I was in middle school.

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,360
I built a website with the website builder, Angelfire.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,240
I doubt most of the listeners will know that, the veterans might.

21
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,960
So but it wasn't good enough.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,080
So I started playing around with it to customize some of the CSS here and there, things like

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
that.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,420
And then I just kind of fell in love with it.

25
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:38,200
So ever since I've just been addicted to writing code and building things and customizing things,

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,240
back in the day of MySpace, I'd customize everyone's themes for them, things like that.

27
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,560
But yeah, I mean, eventually I got into it as a career.

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:56,760
I used to do audio engineering and used to be a musician, but kind of realized that I

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:06,960
prefer working better hours than running sound at a bar overnight until 4 a.m. or having

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,160
a more consistent paycheck.

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,200
So I eventually decided to chase development instead, and getting my foot in the door was

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,000
pretty tough, not having a degree at that time, especially.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,360
And once I finally got my foot in the door, then it was just, you know, I couldn't stop.

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,640
I was working day jobs, I was working on the side, I was doing freelance, I was doing anything

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,560
I could to get my hands on some code and might call it a bit of an addiction.

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,740
But it was fun.

37
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,600
And I felt like I was trying to compensate for my lack of education.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,840
So I felt like I constantly had to be working on something and learning new technologies.

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,120
But yeah, because of that, I've been able to work on a lot of different technologies.

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,600
I've been able to work in different industries, hold different positions, part-time, full-time,

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,800
contract, freelance, consultant, fractional CTO, all kinds of stuff.

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
It's just been a wild ride, but it's been a blast.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Yeah, I love that.

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
That sounds very familiar.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,960
I also used to be a musician before I got into tech.

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,280
And kind of switched for the same reason, I couldn't make a decent living enough out

47
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
of it.

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,360
It was just, I was in classical guitar, and so that's a very niche audience.

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,360
And in South Africa, there wasn't a big audience for that and going international is even harder.

50
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,000
So you know, I eventually started toying with tech and then kind of that just one thing

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
led to the other.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
I eventually ended up in tech.

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,280
So that's a very familiar story to me.

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,480
So you've mentioned that you've had access to play with a lot of different technologies

55
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,920
and no kidding, because when I went on your website, you have the section where you can

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,840
learn more about the work you've done and then you have this filter by technology.

57
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,200
And I clicked on that and I was like, holy Moses, there's a lot here.

58
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,720
So is this just a side effect of, like you said, you felt you had to like compensate

59
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,000
for the fact you didn't have an official or whatever degree in tech?

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,840
Or is it just curiosity that drives you to this?

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,280
Yeah, no, it's a bit of both, I think.

62
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,840
What's funny is on my website, that's only the interesting projects that I thought were

63
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,960
worth putting on there.

64
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,360
There's plenty of other ones that I didn't even bother putting on there.

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,640
So the amount of technology I've touched is probably even more than that and I've forgotten

66
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,280
half of it.

67
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,200
A lot of it is, yeah, I'm just really fascinated by the technology and I'm always interested

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,480
in learning new technology.

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm not in favor of these tech wars of react versus view or whatever.

70
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,120
I'm not a fan of it.

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,040
I think all technologies are great and I think they all have pros and cons.

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,280
And I want to play around with all of them, learn all of them just for the heck of it.

73
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
And that's part of it.

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,560
A part of it is, yeah, feeling like I had to compensate for my lack of education.

75
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
At this point, I don't feel like I need to anymore.

76
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,040
But for the first few years of my career, especially, I really felt like I did.

77
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Part of it wasn't exactly my choice either.

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,120
One of the jobs I held, almost every project I worked on, they were like, hey, so you've

79
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
got this project.

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
It's in this technology.

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
Everybody here knows it, so good luck.

82
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,640
And I had to figure it out.

83
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,120
So there was a lot of those that I'm thankful for the experience, but at the time, it was

84
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
a bit, it was rough.

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Yeah, not for sure.

86
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,000
Having to kind of, and I think that that is the, it comes to this point that I've said

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
that everybody is a beginner at something at some point.

88
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,000
It doesn't matter how many years experience you have.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,440
And I think that story exemplifies that, where you work on this project and you gain this

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,200
experience with these set of technologies, and then somebody comes to you and says, hey,

91
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
here's a new project.

92
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Nobody knows what to do.

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Good luck with that.

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,360
And you feel completely like a newbie again, how you have to learn.

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,400
And sometimes it can even be in the same language.

96
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,720
I've told people, the fact that you know JavaScript is going to help you with React, but there

97
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,680
is core concepts of React that is going to trip you up in the beginning, that you need

98
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,480
to, the whole thing of thinking in React, you need to read that part before you jump

99
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
into it.

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,800
Because it's a, you have to have a mental shift.

101
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,440
And then when you go to view, you kind of have to have a different mental shift again.

102
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,280
Because there's similarities, but there's differences as well, even though the underlying

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,480
language is the same for all of them.

104
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Exactly.

105
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Yeah.

106
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,760
I mean, I, when I, you know, my early days, I was working in JavaScript with jQuery for

107
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
a long time.

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,040
And so making that transition from jQuery to View or React or whatever, it was a complete

109
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,600
180 in how I had to think about how to do things.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,460
And at one point I ended up having to go back to a project that was on jQuery after spending

111
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,880
years working in View.

112
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
And it was rough.

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,040
I've forgotten how to think that way.

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,940
And I kept trying to do things in the View way with jQuery, and it just doesn't work

115
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,520
that way.

116
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
So yeah, it is.

117
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,640
It's same language, but entirely different experience.

118
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,760
Yeah.

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,720
I found myself often when I'm in a, let's say I'm in a lot of JavaScript project, wanting

120
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,400
to reach for a use state look, and I'm like, oh wait, that doesn't exist here.

121
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,640
You have to manage state differently.

122
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,760
Yeah.

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,480
So one of the other things I saw is that you mentioned the words, Indie hacking.

124
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,840
And I'm really interested in that whole ecosystem, like the Indie web and this idea of owning

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,360
your own content, running your own website, having your own domain, and then basically

126
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,800
sharing to the social networks, but the social networks is not where you post.

127
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
That's where you share.

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,600
And I kind of think that's kind of what social media was really for, but it turned into like

129
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,640
it became where people's content live.

130
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,640
And then if one of these platforms goes away, people are like, oh my goodness, all my content's

131
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,680
gone.

132
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,280
And then another thing that you said is that on your Twitter profile, it says like you

133
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,040
make everything in the open.

134
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,520
So those two are very closely related.

135
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:39,040
Do you want to dig a little bit into the concepts of Indie web and making things in the open?

136
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Sure.

137
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Yeah.

138
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,440
And maybe also with the angle of how has that helped you in your career?

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,960
I think that might be interesting to know as well.

140
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Definitely.

141
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Yeah.

142
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,920
I don't remember how I stumbled upon the Indie hacking community.

143
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,320
It was through Twitter, but I think it was just, I don't know, trying to find tech-based

144
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,860
people that were interesting and then over time it eventually kind of led into that.

145
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,440
But somehow now I'm kind of inundated with the Indie hacker community really, and it's

146
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
pretty great.

147
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,520
They're all very supportive.

148
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:20,680
So yeah, a lot of things are based around, for example, the website IndieHackers.com.

149
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,920
Cortlandt Allen built that and eventually Stripe acquired it.

150
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,840
He still runs it.

151
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,840
And it's a really cool resource to let Indie hackers, bootstrappers be able to just kind

152
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,820
of share their information, share their stories, their successes, their failures, what they

153
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,920
learned from that, things like that.

154
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,160
And that's what I like about it is it's different than just my whole career.

155
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,240
Like I said, I've been playing around with technology.

156
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,360
I've built who knows how many things just because they were useless things, but they

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
were just something to build and learn.

158
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,360
And so it kind of shifts that into building something to solve problems, whether it's

159
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,120
solving your own problem, solving someone else's problem that you know.

160
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,320
It's making other people's lives easier by building something interesting.

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,480
And that's kind of that's exactly where I want to be as a developer is the most rewarding

162
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,560
and the most enjoyable thing for me is I want to build something that makes someone else's

163
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,820
life easier.

164
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,240
And so that's what got me sucked into it.

165
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,160
And so I started playing around building different web apps, different, a few different projects

166
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
here and there.

167
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,160
And the thing about the community is everyone, you know, a lot of people share, everybody

168
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,860
shares different levels of information, but everybody in that community is pretty open

169
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,320
about their startup and what they're doing.

170
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,760
Some of them share screenshots of their revenue every month.

171
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,840
And some of them, you know, just show like this is the technology I'm using or this is

172
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:03,080
the problem I had or this was an experience I had with someone reaching out to customer

173
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,760
service and how I solved it.

174
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,840
Everything you don't the thing about building in public and with the indie community is

175
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,680
you don't have to follow a specific rule set.

176
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,320
It's whatever you want to share, share and everybody's just kind of there to help each

177
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,600
other and you learn from everyone's experience.

178
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,280
So you know, that's kind of what got me into it and how I was able to learn a lot from

179
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:34,760
them and hopefully was able to bypass some mistakes, common mistakes because I learned

180
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,840
from other people who had already made those mistakes.

181
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:48,640
Now as far as how that's helped me in my career, I think that could go a few different ways.

182
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,000
In one side, a lot, I see a lot of indie hackers say that because they've started their own

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,240
business and ran their own business, they now consider themselves unhireable.

184
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,920
And for some people, that's their goal.

185
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,280
They want to be unhireable because they just either can't imagine being reporting to a

186
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:14,880
boss, you know, or they just can't deal with the day in, day out of the office work or

187
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,680
whatever the situation is, a lot of people in that community, that's their goal.

188
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,480
For me, it's just been a way to expand my knowledge and my experience of the community,

189
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,320
of the technologies, of new ways of looking at how to build things.

190
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,720
I've been able to bring those experiences into my work and say, hey, I learned something

191
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:45,160
new about React or why don't we think about the customer in this mindset or anything from

192
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,040
technology to just the critical thinking about how you think about things.

193
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,220
And I think it can help you see things from your leader's perspective.

194
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,400
So whether that's your direct boss, manager, or if that's the CEO, CTO of the company,

195
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,400
whatever that situation is, I think it can help you see things from their perspective.

196
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:14,360
Having attempted to run your own small thing, startup, whatever you want to call it, you

197
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,680
can kind of see like, oh, okay, I understand these pain points or I understand that they

198
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,160
have to consider all of these different things.

199
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,600
It's not as straightforward as I thought.

200
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,720
So yeah, I think it can help in a lot of different ways.

201
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
Yeah, that's the last part.

202
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:37,400
A friend of mine, Peter, oftentimes when we've had problems and you have these different

203
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:43,440
potential avenues and you maybe don't understand why you would choose one over the other, he's

204
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,400
often said, imagine that you and your buddy in a garage trying to build something and

205
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,520
you got a million dollars, how would you spend it?

206
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,120
Think about it from that perspective.

207
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
And that's a good thing because now you can put yourself in that situation.

208
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,960
If this was my product and I had a million dollars and it's only the two of us, so we

209
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:09,400
have constraints of finances and we have the constraints if it's only the two of us, which

210
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,640
of these things would you have invested in if it was your company?

211
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,880
So I think it is great.

212
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,560
I think what I'm curious about is the unhireable aspect of that.

213
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,600
Is that like just because you turn more and more into a cat and it's less able to be heard,

214
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
you know, herding cats?

215
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,000
Is it that you turn more into a cat and so it's too hard to herd you?

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,200
So employers are like, ah, go and work with this guy.

217
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,560
Or is it just that literally working a nine to five, doing the same thing is just going

218
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,320
to be soul crushing?

219
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,200
I think it's more of the latter for a lot of people.

220
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,400
The way I understood it, the way I take it when I hear people talk about that is that

221
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:02,100
they I guess they imagined that it would be too impossible for an employer to satisfy

222
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,780
all of their needs to be able to hire them.

223
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,200
So they might have a high set of requirements now of, yeah, well, you know, my time is my

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
own now.

225
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,120
So I'm considered free.

226
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,520
So I'm going to need to be able to work whatever hours I want.

227
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,120
I'm going to need to be able to have this, you know, who knows how big of a salary.

228
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,560
I'm going to need the freedom to work wherever I want, whenever I want.

229
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,360
And who knows what other requirements they might have.

230
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
So I don't know.

231
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,160
I think that might be part of the unhireable approach or mindset.

232
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,760
But again, I think it might be different for everybody.

233
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,680
Some people might just be that they can no longer even imagine going back to working

234
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
the nine to five.

235
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,480
It's too soul crushing for them or whatever.

236
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,440
That's interesting, because I've also been doing the hackers on the website, but I haven't

237
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,080
in a while.

238
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,440
I need to get back there because it is an inspiring place.

239
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:07,640
Do you think, do you see like, because I discovered, I found out about you through Polywork.

240
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,560
And this is how this conversation happened.

241
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:21,760
So do you think Polywork is like, Polywork and IndieHackers, are they like birds of the

242
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,320
same feather or are they mutually exclusive?

243
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm trying to think.

244
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,000
I so I don't use Polywork a whole lot.

245
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,400
Most of that is because I just forget to do things like that to go and look at these communities.

246
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm terrible about keeping up with social media and being involved with the communities.

247
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,680
But I want to I just I never take the time to do it.

248
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:53,440
So from my perspective, I think that they're they're somewhat independent.

249
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:02,680
But Polywork to me is what LinkedIn should have been for people who are IndieHackers,

250
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,720
but not just IndieHackers.

251
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,560
But I think it's better than LinkedIn for people who are IndieHackers or other similar

252
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,800
things where basically you have the whole concept behind it is you're not just one job,

253
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,600
you know, you're not one title, you have all these different roles, whether you're on the

254
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,960
board at another company or whether you're doing freelance or you're running three startups

255
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
or whatever.

256
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,080
I think Polywork is a lot more inclusive for those types of roles.

257
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,680
So I think it's helpful for IndieHackers, but I don't necessarily think they're dependent

258
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
on each other.

259
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Okay.

260
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Yeah, that's a good point of view.

261
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,960
I agree with that.

262
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,240
And I didn't realize that I didn't connect this poly aspect of the poly work with what

263
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,760
you just said until I saw the very first video they posted on the YouTube channel where the

264
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,720
founder of Polywork talked about what the idea behind Polywork is.

265
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,400
And he talked about exactly that.

266
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,200
Like you're undefined by a single role or a single title.

267
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,800
You are multi like what's another TED Talker multi potentialite.

268
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,280
You have all these potentials and you have all these things that you're doing.

269
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,240
And then I was like, gotcha, that makes a lot of sense.

270
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,680
And yeah, I do think like the LinkedIn for IndieHackers, it does sound like a very good

271
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,240
analogy of what it is.

272
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
I'm enjoying it and I'm trying to use it more and more.

273
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,960
And I know they're investing quite a bit in the platform and really trying to grow it.

274
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,360
And I wish them all the best of success.

275
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:42,200
This podcast exists largely because of the amazing people I got that just offered to

276
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,360
come on the podcast, even though it didn't even exist.

277
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,520
So I'm thankful for that.

278
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:54,080
So I read that you were also considered yourself primarily a backend developer, but then more

279
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,820
and more you found yourself leaning towards front end and especially JavaScript was one

280
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,220
of the things that drew you to the front end.

281
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,240
So what are the things about JavaScript that got you really excited and maybe that you're

282
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,240
looking that you enjoy at the moment that you're really excited about right now in the

283
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,960
world and maybe things that's like on the horizon?

284
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,760
Yeah, yeah, sure.

285
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:22,360
So yeah, I mean, most of my experience has been full stack and I usually would lean more

286
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,900
towards the backend, like you said.

287
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:30,200
The front end, I don't mind it, but I'm just not a very visual person.

288
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,160
So I'm not great at the UI, UX kind of stuff.

289
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,920
I need someone else like a designer to kind of help me along with those things.

290
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,200
But otherwise, front end can be enjoyable whenever it's more about the logic and things

291
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
like that.

292
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,520
So what excites me about JavaScript, I love as a full stack developer, I love that I can

293
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,560
use the same language full stack.

294
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,800
It's super exciting now that Node is becoming so popular and frameworks like Nuxt and Next

295
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,400
JS are out there where you can build your full stack all in the same project with the

296
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
same language.

297
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,280
And if you're using things like TypeScript, you can have full stack type safety and things

298
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
like that.

299
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,360
It's really, really cool to be able to have this cohesive system instead of, well, I've

300
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,320
got to have this one environment for my backend with Python, PHP, Go, whatever.

301
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,520
And then this other entirely different environment for front end, which you can still do.

302
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,480
And it's still great if you want to do that.

303
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,600
But the convenience of being able to do it all together in one language, it's really

304
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
cool.

305
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Yeah, that's very true.

306
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,600
It is freeing.

307
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,360
I definitely always saw myself as more of a front end developer, but when Node came along,

308
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,320
it opened up avenues that I didn't have before.

309
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,080
And to some extent, I still see myself as primarily front end, but I definitely can

310
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,600
do the full stack, that's for sure.

311
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,920
I do build projects for some folks that do use Prisma and MongoDB, and it's doing that

312
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
all through Node.

313
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:11,920
So there's some talk, a proposal from Microsoft about bringing the core concepts of TypeScript

314
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
to JavaScript.

315
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,600
It's a bit of a hard topic.

316
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,620
Do you think that's a good idea, or do you think it should be rather two separate things

317
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,620
that you...

318
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,160
Well, the thing is the way that they are...

319
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,200
Because that is a thing you can't just change JavaScript to be a typed language, right?

320
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,720
Because there's way too much code out there that'll break.

321
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,900
That's always the thing with JavaScript is you have to be so careful how you introduce

322
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,860
new features that you don't break things going back.

323
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:46,280
So it looks to me, if what I've read from the proposal is that it's almost like this

324
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,160
JS doc style type of thing where you use annotations, and it's just that that becomes part of the

325
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,400
core language as opposed to it being a TypeScript thing.

326
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,960
Do you think that would be good to have it part of the JavaScript language and therefore

327
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,680
part of ECMA and the standards body as opposed to this thing that Microsoft runs?

328
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,960
Well, that's really interesting.

329
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,480
I hadn't heard that.

330
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:17,840
I mean, I think what you said is pretty much right on it is, sure, it would be really cool

331
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,720
to have that, but man, that would break so much stuff.

332
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,040
So yeah, finding that right balance.

333
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,880
I mean, I guess PHP did similar things, right?

334
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,400
So they started implementing strict types, and you could optionally on each PHP file,

335
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,440
you could optionally put strict type enabled at the top of it, and it would force it.

336
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,680
And it would throw compiling errors basically if it didn't match the types, which I started

337
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:51,680
doing eventually and started forcing all my code to be strictly typed in PHP, but it didn't

338
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,320
break things before that because you had to explicitly enable it per file.

339
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,120
And then eventually maybe moving into having that by default enabled over time could be

340
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,280
useful.

341
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,120
So I think if JavaScript were able to implement something like that, I think it could be cool.

342
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,280
I mean, I think having the type safety in JavaScript helps a lot, and I think it's really

343
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
useful.

344
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:20,480
I think it does make the learning curve much higher for newer developers.

345
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,080
So that's a bit dangerous.

346
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,520
JavaScript is such a common language right now, and it's so easy to be able to tell newer

347
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,280
developers, yeah, just play around JavaScript.

348
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
You can pretty much guarantee to get a job.

349
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,080
You can play with it directly in the browser.

350
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,760
You can test it around very easily.

351
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,040
And don't worry about TypeScript at first, because first you just need to learn how to

352
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,880
write in a programming language, and doing TypeScript I think could be overwhelming to

353
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,360
someone who's new.

354
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,280
So I mean, I don't know.

355
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,120
That's a really interesting concept, but personally I would love it, but I don't think as a whole

356
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,360
I don't think it might be the best idea.

357
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,440
Yeah, I agree with that.

358
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,600
That is also the concern for me is because I can't remember if it was a question I wanted

359
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:12,080
to ask somebody or whether it is something I did pose to someone.

360
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:20,120
But I was asking this question, when do you start introducing TypeScript to new developers?

361
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,720
When is the right time?

362
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,200
And it's pretty far down the line as far as I'm concerned.

363
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,440
There's quite a lot in JavaScript to just wrap your head around.

364
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,320
If you don't understand the whole idea of closures and the whole idea of how you do

365
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,880
functional programming in JavaScript, because that seems to be like where JavaScript is

366
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,640
moving more and more, then adding types on top of that, it's going to be...

367
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,240
I think one of the nice things about frontend, but just web in general, is how approachable

368
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,400
it is.

369
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:03,160
It's not easy, but it's definitely easier than trying to get into like an enterprise

370
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,080
level language as your first language.

371
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,800
Yeah, the entry point is a lot lower.

372
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:18,080
You can do quite a bit without having to have this breadth of programming experience.

373
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,160
I think it's almost like you can already now, if you write some JavaScript and it's not

374
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,800
like using ESM, then you can put the little use strict at the top.

375
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,440
And then it tells the JavaScript parser, hey, if you're running into a thing, just don't

376
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
try and help me.

377
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,360
Just throw an error, which is like PHP, like you said.

378
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,440
So maybe though, if this comes to pass, maybe it'll be something like that.

379
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,480
Maybe we'll have a type annotation to say, add type safe or something, and then it kicks

380
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,320
into a different JavaScript engine.

381
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,880
It would have to be an optional opt-in that over time, we could potentially move to be

382
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,560
default to true, but for now, for a long time, it would have to be something like that, yeah.

383
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:11,000
So another tricky potentially question, what do you see as the biggest challenges in tech?

384
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,720
Yeah, that's a great question.

385
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,240
Specifically in web development too, I think this applies more so in web development than

386
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,920
most other areas, although maybe not.

387
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't have that much experience outside of web, but analysis paralysis.

388
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,600
I think there are way too many cool tools in web development and technologies, programming

389
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,600
languages, frameworks, whatever, that how do you decide what to use for each project?

390
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,960
And do you keep using the same thing or do you use the new shiny thing every day?

391
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,040
There's just too much of that.

392
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,960
And it's great, but it is super overwhelming, especially for newer developers.

393
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,000
But even today, I struggle with that regularly of if I'm starting a new project, oh, I would

394
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
love to play around with this new cool technology, but I could use the same thing that's safe,

395
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,920
I know it, and I could do it a lot faster and it would be a better end result because

396
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,240
I know it so well.

397
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,600
So I think that's one of the big challenges and kind of along the same lines is it changes

398
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,760
so rapidly.

399
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,800
Every day there's something new or things are updated every day where new features or

400
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:32,080
deprecated or whatever, the rapid changing of the front end technologies is it can feel

401
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,560
overwhelming to keep up with whether you're an early stage developer or a veteran, especially

402
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,400
in the front end.

403
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:45,120
And for me, I think those are two of the biggest challenges.

404
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:54,320
So do you have any strategies for how to safely drink from the fire hose?

405
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:06,760
I for me, it's been so as an indie hacker, you know, they always say, don't go with a

406
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,640
new shiny, go with what you know, the best framework to build your project in is the

407
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,720
thing that you know the best, whatever you're most comfortable in.

408
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,600
And, you know, majority of the time, that is true.

409
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:27,920
I think that's a great case unless your plan or your goal is to expand your portfolio of

410
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,700
technology for your resume or whatever.

411
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,960
If that's your goal, then sure, learn something new.

412
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,620
But for the most case, I think it's whatever you already know.

413
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:44,600
But if you're jumping in brand new and you don't know anything, what I found is jumping

414
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,760
into if you have resources, if you have contacts of somebody who's already in that field, maybe

415
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,720
learning something that they know, so that they can be a mentor, or at least just be

416
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,140
a source of support.

417
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,040
And then from there, you can branch out to whatever kind of comes your way.

418
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:09,440
For me, most of the technology I learned was a result of either somebody I knew or a job

419
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,380
I got.

420
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:18,160
And so it was not always my choice, but I got led down these paths because those are

421
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,000
the doors that opened to me.

422
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,680
And then some of the other ones, I kind of forced open myself because I would spend who

423
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,800
knows how many hours trying to learn new things because I wanted to learn it.

424
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:37,160
But I mean, that's how I spent half of my career in the e-commerce framework Magento.

425
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,120
It was one of those projects at that job where they were like, well, we don't have a Magento

426
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,160
person and we have a new Magento project, so you win.

427
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:51,400
And from then on, I was the Magento guy because I terribly built a website in Magento.

428
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:57,600
And five, six years later, no, four or five years later, I don't know.

429
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,640
I got a job as a Magento developer across the ocean in an entirely new continent.

430
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,160
And got to come over to France and work a job there as the Magento guy at this company.

431
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:14,160
And after that, I kind of decided I'm done with Magento.

432
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,560
I'm ready to go back to building tools.

433
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,620
Like I said, I want to build tools that people use and not e-commerce or marketing things.

434
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:27,200
So I kind of got out of that eventually, but that experience helped me get to where I am.

435
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:34,120
So yeah, I kind of went off on a tangent there, but that's all good, that's all good.

436
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,480
So to go further off on a tangent, there's two tools that I've seen that you've built

437
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
that really intrigues me.

438
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,920
And one is really funny.

439
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:50,100
And I can totally understand why you created that because I've heard so many developer

440
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,080
stories about how many domain names do you own?

441
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,160
And it's like, let me pull up my spreadsheet and see where I'm up to.

442
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,240
And I've also got probably more than I use.

443
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,600
So the two tools I'm talking about, the one is completely different, but I'm curious about

444
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
that one.

445
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,200
And that's My Cosplace.

446
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,260
And then the other one is Domain Goalie, which is such a cool name.

447
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,040
If you want to talk about those two.

448
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Yeah.

449
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,720
So Domain Goalie, exactly.

450
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
It's a silly product.

451
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,760
So yeah, we all know the joke, the running joke of developers and indie hackers both

452
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,220
of we have way too many domains.

453
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,940
We're kind of obsessed with buying them.

454
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,840
We have a graveyard of dead projects that we never finished, but we bought the domain

455
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,200
for it.

456
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,320
And it's just a running joke because it's true for a lot of us.

457
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,160
And I think one day I saw somebody on Twitter post something like, can I hire someone to

458
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,320
insult me every time I try to buy a domain or something silly like that.

459
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,380
And I just thought it was so funny.

460
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,040
And I thought, well, I mean, I can't be there to watch over your shoulder, but a browser

461
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,980
extension can be.

462
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,480
So I just spent like a couple hours that evening like, hey, I've never built a browser extension.

463
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,080
Let's figure out how to do that.

464
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,680
And just played around, built a super simple, silly browser extension that basically just

465
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,920
it's right now it only supports a few of the main websites where you buy domains, but it

466
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,040
checks to see if you're trying to buy a domain and it shows a pop up that basically tries

467
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,240
to talk sense into you to kind of say like, hey, will you be spending time on this in

468
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
two years?

469
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,800
Like, is this really worth your money right now?

470
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,840
And I mean, you know, it's not really useful.

471
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,640
It's kind of annoying, but it's just a fun little thing.

472
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,200
And I think I've got like one person using it.

473
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,440
And it is what it is.

474
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,880
It was just a fun response of like, hey, I built this in case you want to use it kind

475
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
of thing.

476
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,060
Yeah, that's, that's hilarious, but it's cool.

477
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,040
I like how that often leads you down the wrong path.

478
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,240
Like exactly here, it was a case of, I've never built a browser extension.

479
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,640
Let me see what that's all about.

480
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,280
And here's a project that we can talk about.

481
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,260
And so my cosplays, how does, how did that come about?

482
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,440
So yeah, my wife and I, we go to conventions like Dragon Con, similar to Comic Con, but

483
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
other ones.

484
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,720
And we usually will cosplay, we'll dress up in costume of different characters.

485
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,680
So my wife is great at making those cosplays.

486
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,560
I just put them on and wear them.

487
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:32,440
But one of the most annoying things about that is the hours, days, weeks you'll spend

488
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,520
afterwards searching for photos of yourself.

489
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,900
And a lot of times there are Facebook groups where people will just dump their hundreds

490
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,440
or thousands of photos they took and you'll just scroll through all of them trying to

491
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,440
find them.

492
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,720
And you know, it's annoying, but it is what it is.

493
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,440
And I've also found like at a lot of photo shoots at conventions, a lot of us would spend

494
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,080
time afterwards just looking each other up on our phones on Instagram right then and

495
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,960
there, following each other so we could post, you know, photos of each other.

496
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,720
And I just thought there's got to be a better way to do this.

497
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,280
So I decided it was, I think a year ago at the convention, I kind of thought, all right,

498
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,600
I want to, I want to think about this, see if I can find a way to make this easier for

499
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
us.

500
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,520
And so my first thought was, yeah, business cards would be cool, having pictures of you

501
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,440
and your cosplays on the business cards so that way the person won't forget, they're

502
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,720
going to take hundreds of photos at that convention.

503
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,760
They're going to forget who gave them that card.

504
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,680
And the problem with that is every year you're going to have new cosplays.

505
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,240
I have some friends, one of my friends last year brought, this year brought 16 cosplays.

506
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,960
I mean, there's no way he's going to fit all those photos on a card.

507
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,560
And then every year he'd have to get new cards printed.

508
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,180
So it's not, that's not really reasonable.

509
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,180
So then I thought, you know, a digital portfolio you can update whenever you want.

510
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,280
But how do you connect that?

511
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,240
And so then I thought, well, okay, QR codes, QR codes have been really popular, especially

512
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
through COVID.

513
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,960
They've kind of made a comeback because of the pandemic, I think, especially within Europe,

514
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,700
at least.

515
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:11,760
So I thought, okay, build a portfolio, get a QR code that points to that portfolio.

516
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,400
You can also have all your links to social media accounts.

517
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,040
So it's kind of like a link tree with a portfolio combined.

518
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,840
And then you can get business cards with a couple photos of your cosplays on them and

519
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,620
then that QR code.

520
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:30,000
So people can either at that moment scan the QR code and go to your website, or they can

521
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
take the card.

522
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,200
And then later, if they forget who you were, they can scan it and find a photo of the cosplay

523
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,500
that you were in.

524
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,360
And so I thought, okay, maybe that'll kind of connect everything.

525
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,080
So yeah, I built my cosplays as a way to try and do all of that.

526
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:50,000
This year at DragonCon was my first year really getting to try it out.

527
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,080
In the meantime, I've had a few other users test it out at a couple other conventions,

528
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
one in...

529
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:00,720
Oh, I've completely lost where it was.

530
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,720
So nevermind.

531
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:08,360
Anyway, it was somewhere here in Europe, I can't remember now.

532
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:13,840
So I've seen a few people try it out, and then I tested it out this year at DragonCon.

533
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,880
To be honest, I didn't get the reaction I thought it would.

534
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,680
It still seems to be missing something that really...

535
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,520
I think either people don't see its relevance or don't see its value right away.

536
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,120
So whether or not it's missing a feature or if it's missing just clear communication,

537
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,600
haven't quite figured that out yet.

538
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,520
But I think it's on the right track.

539
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,920
And I've got a group of friends who we all cosplay together and I've gotten a lot of

540
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,440
feedback from them about it and what they thought it was when they first saw it or what

541
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,480
they expect it to be.

542
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,200
So I think it'll continue to change.

543
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,800
There might be more of a social platform aspect to it.

544
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:02,760
A lot of cosplayers seem to use Facebook groups, but a lot of people hate using Facebook now.

545
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,400
I mean, there's a lot of drama around that.

546
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,800
So a lot of people don't want to be on the platform, but Facebook groups is really the

547
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,400
only place they can find that experience or those cosplay groups.

548
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,360
So maybe finding a way to implement a way for them to replace Facebook groups with this

549
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,080
platform might be useful.

550
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,280
Just some different ideas I'm playing with right now.

551
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Yeah.

552
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:37,720
I've totally heard talk about this idea that there is a need for very niche social networks.

553
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:46,920
And I think Web3 is an interesting topic that has multiple angles and depending on which

554
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,880
angle you approach it at, you'll have different people respond in different ways.

555
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,640
I think some of the underlying core concepts that has been forgotten isn't a bad idea.

556
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:06,000
The whole idea of being decentralized, owning what you make, forming smaller groups, I think

557
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
those are good ideas.

558
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,720
And I think that might be where it plays into because things like Mastodon and stuff like

559
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,800
that, where you can spin up your own little version of Twitter in a sense, but for a very

560
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,000
niche community.

561
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,800
And you can cross-link it between other Mastodon instances that is relevant, but different

562
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,100
enough to have their own niche.

563
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,280
So I think maybe you're onto something here.

564
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,880
I think maybe the cosplay community would like this.

565
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,280
Yeah, honestly, I was against it being anything similar to a social platform for a while.

566
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,200
I kept pushing back on that.

567
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,800
Part of that is I just didn't want to deal with a social platform.

568
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,480
There's always so much stuff that you have to deal with that with moderators and just

569
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,420
the worst people always ruin it for everybody else.

570
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,520
So I didn't want to deal with that.

571
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,760
But also I just kept thinking, there's so many great social platforms out there.

572
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,280
Who's going to want to use this random one that I built?

573
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,400
I mean, who am I kidding?

574
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,920
I'm not going to be able to compete with a platform like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,

575
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,640
things like that, nor do I want to.

576
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,480
But your point kind of has been what you just said has been made clear to me, I think by

577
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,960
multiple people who I've tried talking to about my cosplays is, yeah, well, they want

578
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,880
a more specific platform that is dedicated to cosplayers and just the cosplay community

579
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,360
wants somewhere to live, basically.

580
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,840
And there are other platforms that I think have been trying to do that.

581
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,080
And so again, I wasn't trying to compete with them.

582
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,080
And if they are doing a good job, great, let's go there.

583
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,920
But so far, I haven't seen any traction on any of them.

584
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,520
Some people have kind of said like, oh, this platform we thought was going to be great,

585
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,480
but it didn't really do what we wanted it to do or whatever.

586
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,360
So yeah, I think maybe there is a want for that.

587
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,440
But I kind of was closed minded about that for a little bit and wasn't open to trying

588
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
that.

589
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,520
But I think finally, they've talked me into it.

590
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:14,080
Yeah, I have a project that I've not abandoned, but it's been definitely put on the back burner

591
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
for quite some time.

592
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,520
And it's because of a lot of the same fears.

593
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,880
So that one is a very different audience.

594
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:28,160
The audience is finding small businesses in your own area and supporting small local businesses.

595
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,560
But I did think that one of the benefits or something like that would be the ability to

596
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,720
review.

597
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,440
And that scares me.

598
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:45,880
Because now you're opening it up to user comments and I'm like, I don't know if I want to go

599
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
down that road.

600
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,240
So I've kind of been, I think that's one of the reasons why I kind of just let the project,

601
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,040
it's live, it's up there.

602
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,000
It's working in a shape and form like I get these stats that four people visited it this

603
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
week.

604
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,480
Everybody visited this week.

605
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,480
Two people visited this week.

606
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,360
And I'm like, okay, so somehow people are stumbling upon it.

607
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,960
But again, I need to invest time and energy into that.

608
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,520
And I think there needs to be a social aspect to it.

609
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
And that scares me.

610
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,520
And I think that's why I've put up something as simple as people being able to upload a

611
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,360
profile photo scares me.

612
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,920
Because now you have to monitor that stuff because people can upload anything as their

613
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
profile picture.

614
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,360
Now you have to go think like, what machine learning thing can I put in?

615
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Is it going to be biased?

616
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:34,120
Is it going to flag stuff that is actually fine, but the data set it's been trained on

617
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,560
is biased.

618
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,160
And that's why it's flagging these things.

619
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,560
And it's causing me more work than it's helping me.

620
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,960
So I think it's those things that as an indie hacker and stuff like that, you often run

621
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,520
into and where you kind of lose steam with the thing because it's just like, oh my goodness,

622
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
I don't know.

623
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,840
But again, then I think that's where community comes in, where you can talk about these things

624
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
to other indie hackers.

625
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,280
And they might say, hey, you know what, I've actually had that fear, but this is how I

626
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
solved it.

627
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,360
And you can be like, oh my goodness, I did not know about this.

628
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,720
So I think that's where community comes into play.

629
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,840
So yeah, well, good luck with those.

630
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,480
I think there's something there.

631
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:19,840
And I hope it blossoms into something that the cosplay community can be excited about.

632
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:25,520
Another thing that I'm excited about, because I saw that you posted this in July-ish of

633
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:32,280
this year, I think is a blogging series about using DevTools for beginners, which is like

634
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,760
perfect for the audience of this podcast.

635
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,400
Two questions.

636
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,000
Why do you see as DevTools?

637
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,520
Because oftentimes when I think DevTools, I think you open command, what's it command

638
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,000
alt I, those DevTools, or do you mean more a broad sense of DevTools?

639
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,680
Yeah, maybe DevTools wasn't the best word to use there.

640
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:02,680
Yeah, so for me as a self-taught developer, one of the hardest parts, I think, of learning

641
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:09,080
things was tutorials and courses, things like that, would cover the language or the framework

642
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
you're on.

643
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,440
But they would kind of assume that you know how to set up your local development environment

644
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,760
or they might assume that you know how to use package handler or whatever.

645
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,600
And those are the things where it's like, wait, what is this NPM?

646
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,600
What does that even mean?

647
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,240
And then you have to go down rabbit hole after rabbit hole of figuring out how to do these

648
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,660
things and then connecting the pieces.

649
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:41,920
And I think that that's a part that's sorely lacking in educational content, or at least

650
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,960
it's hard to find it.

651
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,960
So I was considering a while back, I wanted to start writing more, blogging more, I kind

652
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,960
of enjoy doing it and I would like to give back to the development community that's taught

653
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,760
me so much over the years.

654
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,400
And so I asked an early stage developer that I've been mentoring for a while, what his

655
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,240
biggest pain points were, or things that he would love to have more resources about.

656
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,120
And he basically said exactly that, that connecting all those pieces of, yeah, sure, there's teaching

657
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,320
me how to code, but they're not teaching me how to set up my environment so I can be ready

658
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,000
to code or things like that.

659
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,480
And as soon as he said that, it kind of clicked that, oh, yeah, I had that same problem.

660
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,520
It makes sense, I would love to write about something like that then.

661
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,880
To be honest, I haven't, since I posted that, I haven't made any progress, I've been dealing

662
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,000
with a new job and an international move.

663
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,840
So things have been falling a little bit behind schedule, but I'm hoping to get started working

664
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,120
on the actual posts soon.

665
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,320
And I'm also open to, I'm hoping it'll be a growing, living thing.

666
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,680
So I'm open to if somebody asks, you know, hey, could you cover this topic, if it's something

667
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:59,720
that I'm able to cover, then I'd be happy to add it to the list and to the series and

668
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,720
write about it.

669
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
Yeah.

670
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,720
But yeah, I'm excited to do it.

671
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,800
I'm hoping to learn a lot about it while I write too.

672
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,680
Yeah, no, that's one of my, like, again, I've also neglected blogging.

673
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,280
I used to do it in the early days a lot.

674
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,680
And then I kind of stopped, I think I hit a serious case of imposter syndrome and I

675
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,440
was literally too scared to post anything because I was like, what if I'm completely

676
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,360
wrong here and somebody points it out?

677
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,600
Yeah, that's one of the biggest things that's held me back from writing for years.

678
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Yeah.

679
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,480
And also the other thing of there's so much on the internet, what is it going to help

680
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,240
me to just write yet another blog post?

681
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
Exactly.

682
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,800
And it's, you know, it's both of those things are like, you're trying to, it's your amygdala

683
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,920
trying to keep you safe.

684
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,360
But there's no real danger here.

685
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,440
But try convincing that little monkey mind that it's wrong.

686
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,440
Exactly.

687
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,620
I mean, that's always been the big thing pushing me back is, yeah, but what do I know?

688
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,240
Because everything I know, I've already learned from the internet, so it's already out there.

689
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,360
When am I going to contribute to that?

690
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,680
But over time, I've had to just learn that I have a unique perspective, just like everyone

691
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,600
else has their own unique perspective given because of their experiences.

692
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,980
And you know, maybe my unique perspective might help one person.

693
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,640
So why not?

694
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,000
Yeah, I agree.

695
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,840
I think that's the key is everybody has a unique way of approaching things and the way

696
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:35,480
you do it might just be the way that helps somebody else understand it where all the

697
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,920
other things they read, just it didn't click.

698
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,160
I mean, I for the longest time didn't quite click with closures.

699
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:46,640
And then I followed a course on front end masters where one person was talking about

700
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,640
it.

701
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
I can't remember her name now.

702
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:56,240
But and the way that she explained it was just like, oh, it's actually kind of obvious

703
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
now that I understand what it is.

704
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,320
So exactly.

705
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,440
I think the more voices I think the whole talk about diversity, it leads this is part

706
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,520
of it, diverse, diverse voices, I think is important.

707
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,080
Because again, somebody that I also mentor just yesterday told me I don't understand

708
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,600
what the package of JSON is.

709
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,760
And I was like, yeah, right, right, it is kind of confusing, right?

710
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,440
It's this thing that you have in the root folder and you kind of think that you have

711
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,600
to have it.

712
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,280
But you're like, I put it there because it seems like it needs to be there.

713
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,880
But honest to goodness, I don't know what it does.

714
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,880
And so I'd like, I want to dig into it a little bit more.

715
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,560
And I think this is the kind of stuff that you want to cover in your blog series.

716
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,600
Because it is, it is like, what is it?

717
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,600
What's the point of it?

718
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,560
And there is a reason, there's a point for it.

719
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,160
But it's not obvious if you don't go and really dig into it.

720
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,040
And it's actually important to understand what its purpose is.

721
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
Right.

722
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,040
Yeah.

723
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
So that's super interesting.

724
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:58,400
So with that, and the fact that you've mentioned that you do mentor folks, what advice do you

725
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,800
have like for early stage web developers, as I like to call it, you know, either from

726
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,400
a technical perspective or a career growth finding work thing or both?

727
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,400
Yeah.

728
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:17,440
Yeah, I'd say I've got kind of two main things that I usually try to try to tell people.

729
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,020
First of all, build something real, tutorials, courses, things like that are great and all,

730
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,400
but they only go so far.

731
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,920
The first time you have a project where it's, hey, here's a list of requirements or we

732
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,420
want to accomplish XYZ, whatever, and you just have to use critical thinking to figure

733
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,960
out how to build it.

734
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,640
And sure, you can, you know, you're going to Google a lot and you're going to probably

735
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,660
copy a lot of things from Stack Overflow, although preferably you would write it while

736
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,060
reading because it'll stick better.

737
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,520
But either way, you're going to do a lot of that.

738
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,920
And the fact that you had to use critical thinking to connect those pieces and to make

739
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,640
each little piece work together as opposed to just following a course, you're going to

740
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:13,880
learn wildly more than you would have in months of courses versus one project like that.

741
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:20,200
It's just, it's going to grow your learning and your experience exponentially.

742
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,400
And I think not only that, but it also helps your portfolio, right?

743
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,760
I mean, there's a portfolio of, hey, I did this.

744
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,680
And as someone who doesn't have a degree, I learned early on that for my resume to even

745
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,160
be considered, I had to have a portfolio of real things that I built.

746
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,880
You know, tutorial things that I built are fine and all, but they don't go very far.

747
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,160
You need to show, hey, I built this thing on my own.

748
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,300
I didn't follow tutorial.

749
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,480
It was my creation.

750
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,440
It doesn't have to be complicated, but just something.

751
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,000
And you know, going into that, the first time we do that, it's going to be overwhelming.

752
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,320
It's going to be terrifying.

753
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:02,680
You're probably going to think that nobody should pay you right now because of your inexperience

754
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,880
or maybe you don't feel worthy of being paid or you don't think that they will think you're

755
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,520
worthy of being paid or whatever, right?

756
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,640
But I mean, veteran developers have these same thoughts.

757
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,640
It's called imposter syndrome.

758
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,680
Like you already said, we always think about this.

759
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,640
But your first project, now don't lie, you know, be transparent.

760
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,040
I'm an early stage developer, I'm learning, but I'm confident that I will do whatever

761
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,520
it takes to get this done and to build the product that you want.

762
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,080
I'm going to learn a lot along the way.

763
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,980
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm going to figure it out.

764
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,880
And that's kind of the whole point of a job of a developer is figuring it out.

765
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:49,980
I mean, even now, it's not always just coding, it's figuring it out.

766
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:55,260
So I think, you know, you have to just push yourself past that and jump on a project and

767
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,880
make sure you can do a free project for some people.

768
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,860
But getting paid for an actual project, whether it's freelance or whatever, even if it's just

769
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:07,280
a small amount, it, I don't know, it's a world of difference and it makes you feel more confident

770
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,280
too.

771
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,040
And it's just a great feeling of, hey, I built that people are using it.

772
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,040
I got paid for it.

773
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,440
It'll change a lot.

774
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,300
So I think that's a huge milestone for early stage developers that you have to try and

775
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,000
get over as soon as you can.

776
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,760
And the second thing, which kind of ties into the first one is contribute to open source.

777
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:32,080
You know, you can either get into open source as a gateway into building things on your

778
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,880
own so you can seek those things out.

779
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,440
A lot of open source software, they have, you know, public get hubs, things like that.

780
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,760
You can go search through their issue list.

781
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,400
And a lot of times they have them tagged for like good first time issues or something like

782
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,960
that that are great to just kind of introduce you into working on something, a project that

783
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,160
other people work on.

784
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,600
Or it can be a side effect of the first thing where you start building things that use open

785
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,640
source and then you start finding bugs or you start finding missing features that you

786
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,280
think they would, that it could use.

787
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,240
And then you contribute to add those things, which is how I got into it.

788
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:17,440
And either way, it's great because it not only gives you more experience to work on

789
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:22,480
different technologies or even if the same technology, just different projects.

790
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,360
But it helps you get involved with the community.

791
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,640
You get to meet new people.

792
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,820
It helps you learn how to contribute to a project where you're not the only contributor.

793
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:37,380
So it kind of helps maybe teach you things about Git and how that works or just in general,

794
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,200
like code reviews, things like that.

795
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:46,880
Speaking of code reviews, it also means that other developers who are successfully maintaining

796
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,120
a software are going to be reviewing your code, which just means that it gives you new

797
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,360
perspectives on your code reviews.

798
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,160
Don't take offense if they tell you you did something wrong or you should change it this

799
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,360
way or that way.

800
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,680
Just be open minded about that and understand that they are successfully maintaining the

801
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,060
software.

802
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,060
You're contributing to it.

803
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,120
So use that as a learning experience.

804
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,080
You can push back if you disagree, but just be civil about it.

805
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,240
And then it also can get your name out there.

806
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:24,040
I mean, I had a job offer simply because I was contributing to certain open source software.

807
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,680
And when they found out I was leaving my job at the time, they reached out to me and they

808
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,700
were like, hey, is it too late to offer you a job?

809
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,320
So I mean, it can open up great opportunities.

810
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,540
Plus, it looks good on a resume.

811
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,100
You can always put that on a resume that you contributed to these open source software.

812
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:47,340
And then it also just, I don't know, it's a different feeling to successfully have code

813
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:52,280
that you wrote be merged into open source software that who knows how many other people

814
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,280
use.

815
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,280
It's super rewarding.

816
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,280
It feels really cool.

817
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,280
Yeah.

818
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
Yeah.

819
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
That's incredible advice.

820
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,280
Thanks for sharing that.

821
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:09,920
And that leads me to one of the most questions I have for you and it is, so you've built

822
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:16,000
a SaaS product that you are very proud of and as you should be.

823
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,760
What have you learned about product development in the process of building this project?

824
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,840
Yeah.

825
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,600
So the project is Status Tracker.

826
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,960
It was my first SaaS product.

827
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,960
It was my first time really delving into the indie hacking community and trying to build

828
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,520
my own thing.

829
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:41,600
So I mean, I've learned a lot from that project.

830
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,560
One of the things I learned in that project was something I said earlier, which was the

831
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,120
best tool or the best technology to use is a technology that you know well.

832
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:55,280
I use this as an excuse to learn some new things, but kind of a combination of some

833
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,960
new things, some things I was familiar with.

834
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,640
So it meant that I didn't build it as well as I could have, but I did learn some new

835
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:07,440
stuff and so I built it on Next.js and I used a boilerplate so it kind of came with some

836
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:15,000
TypeScript baked in and some other stuff with GraphQL and a few other tools.

837
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:22,280
So I was able to learn a few new things that I've since used on following projects, but

838
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:31,280
it also kind of taught me personally, I am not great at the non-technical part of building

839
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,240
and maintaining a product.

840
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:41,680
I need the yin to my yang to be able to handle those non-technological, non-tech parts.

841
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:49,780
I can try to do them poorly, but I don't enjoy them and I'm not great at them.

842
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:57,960
So things like reaching out to the community and talking to potential users and just typical

843
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:04,680
sales marketing type things, they're just not an area that I'm comfortable in.

844
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:10,360
And I tried it and I kind of lost my interest, I kind of lost my interest in the project

845
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,120
entirely while trying to do those things.

846
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,880
So some people are able to jump in and do those things and some people aren't and you

847
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,320
kind of have to figure that out for yourself.

848
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,720
For me, I figured out that it's not the right fit for me and I need to find someone else

849
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,720
to help me with that.

850
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,000
Now some of that could though be the subject matter.

851
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,320
With my cosplays, I feel a lot better doing those things because it's a community that

852
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,440
I'm already involved in.

853
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:40,680
I'm my own user, so it helps a lot and I am a cosplayer, I talk with other cosplayers,

854
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,360
I enjoy that community and being involved with them, so it's a little different.

855
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,080
So I think part of that too is if you're going to build something like this and maintain

856
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:56,640
a product, maybe focus on something that the target audience is an audience that you want

857
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:01,320
to be a part of, or that you are a part of, or that you enjoy working with.

858
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,720
Something like that where you're not going to get burnt out dealing with them every day.

859
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,680
Yeah, that's great advice, I 100% agree with all of that.

860
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:16,640
Me building a company, it's turned into an agency and that's what I didn't want it to

861
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,640
be.

862
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:25,720
I have to 180 and I have to ask myself these tough questions about how did I get here and

863
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:31,160
how do I walk it back to being the thing that I actually wanted it to be to start off with

864
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,920
and also defining what those things are.

865
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:36,040
I think the reason why it happened is I never defined them.

866
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:41,840
I never wrote the company mission, if you want to put it that way and so if you don't

867
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:47,960
have a north star, then it's easy to get off course without realizing it.

868
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,680
If you don't have questions to ask yourself when somebody reaches out to you to do work,

869
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,080
you don't have those questions like does this go towards the mission of the company?

870
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,320
No, then don't take the work.

871
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:07,760
And of course, circumstances can affect that, like if a pandemic hits and you suddenly find

872
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:14,320
that oh boy, you might put the mission on the side for a little bit and say yes to things

873
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:19,200
you wouldn't normally do but yeah, it's one of those things that happens.

874
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,640
So in closing, I know you enjoy traveling.

875
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:28,360
I used to love it when I used to be able to do that through one of the clients that I

876
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:29,360
work with.

877
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,360
Cool, yeah.

878
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:35,640
As you mentioned, you've been doing less of that for the same reason everybody else has

879
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:42,000
been doing this, but I'm curious, what has been some of the favorite places that you've

880
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,040
visited and why those places?

881
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,400
Yeah, yeah, that's a tough question.

882
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:57,120
I'm not much of a favorite person, like I'm terrible at picking favorites.

883
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:03,140
But I think, I guess I would probably have to say just France in general, but mostly

884
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:07,640
that's because we lived there for the past four years, so we've been able to travel it

885
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,800
and see more of it than we have really anything else.

886
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:16,280
So I've been able to have a few kind of really cool memories of, we've taken a couple of

887
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:22,560
road trips through France, the first time we, so we lived in Paris and we drove down

888
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:29,200
through France, down south, went down to Nice, and then we kind of spent about a week driving

889
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,280
along the Cote d'Azur or the French Riviera.

890
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,920
And so we kind of drove our way west over to Montpellier and then kind of drove back

891
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,400
up north to Paris again.

892
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,680
So we kind of got to see quite a bit of the coast, but then also, you know, southern France

893
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,040
and things like that.

894
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,200
We got to see a lot of really cool stuff.

895
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,100
We didn't spend a lot of time in any one location, but it was just being able to see as much

896
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,440
of it as we could was really cool.

897
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:01,680
And I think that was right after things started opening up after the pandemic, well, after

898
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,600
the pandemic, during the pandemic when things started opening up.

899
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,800
And so we decided, well, we don't want to take a train, you know, we don't want to be

900
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,720
enclosed with other humans right now.

901
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,000
So let's take a car, let's drive, be on our own.

902
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,120
And so we got to do stuff like that.

903
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,240
And then we got a little bit later, my parents came to visit.

904
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,300
And so we took a road trip through the north of France and went through a lot of Normandy

905
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,680
and places like that.

906
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,440
And so we've been able to see so much of France, it's just been really cool.

907
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,500
But I look forward to being able to do that in other locations.

908
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,920
Now that we're in Ireland, I'd like to do that more here.

909
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:41,600
But also, there's still plenty more of the world in general that we would like to travel

910
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,600
to more.

911
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:48,720
And I think my number one place that we are wanting to go to that we were supposed to

912
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,040
have gone to during the pandemic was for our 10 year wedding anniversary, we were going

913
01:00:54,040 --> 01:01:00,800
to New Zealand, we were going to do the whole Hobbit trail thing, all that stuff.

914
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,140
But of course, COVID ruined that.

915
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,800
So that's on our plans.

916
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,880
We're hoping to get that rescheduled soon.

917
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,720
But I think that's kind of my number one, like, I'm excited.

918
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,320
I've been excited to go to New Zealand for years.

919
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,320
So I really look forward to it.

920
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
Yeah, sounds exciting.

921
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:22,160
Yeah, I think that's also a place that I'd like to visit more so than Australia, to be

922
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160
honest.

923
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,000
I just have too many bugs.

924
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I don't do good with bugs.

925
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,760
And some of the freaky stuff that I've seen there, it just comes out of your shoes in

926
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,760
the morning.

927
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,280
I'm just like, no, no.

928
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,280
It is terrifying.

929
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,280
It is.

930
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,880
I mean, I'm morbidly curious to go.

931
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,200
We have some friends that we met in France who now live in Australia.

932
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,760
So you know, they've offered to house us if we go visit.

933
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,360
So we might do it one day, but I'm kind of the same, a little nervous, but still really

934
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,360
would like to go.

935
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,360
Yeah, it's a beautiful country.

936
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,360
I mean, don't get me wrong.

937
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:04,840
It's just there's a lot of creepy crawlies and I don't do good with those creepy crawlies.

938
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
Sure.

939
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,960
Well, Joel, thanks.

940
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,960
This is really, really good.

941
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,240
I really enjoyed speaking with you.

942
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,760
It's really easy to talk to you.

943
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,440
And I think we share a lot of the same interests, so that helps and the same viewpoints.

944
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,440
Thanks so much.

945
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,920
I hope you enjoy the rest of your Friday.

946
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,280
I hope you have a lovely weekend and yeah.

947
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,280
Thanks so much for joining.

948
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,280
Yeah, you too.

949
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,280
Thanks for having me.

950
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,280
