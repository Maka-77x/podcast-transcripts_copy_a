Welcome to the Marsilian Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.680 --> 00:10.160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.840
Hey Joel, welcome to the Marsilian Network Podcast.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.040
Hey, yeah, thanks for having me.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.040
Super excited to be here.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.040
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.720
So I always ask people to write a short introduction in the doc.

00:22.720 --> 00:27.000
The idea is that I'll put it in the show notes eventually.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.480
I used to read them out, but then I thought, no, I don't want to be the person telling

00:32.480 --> 00:33.480
your story.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.640
You should tell your story.

00:34.640 --> 00:41.160
But what I like about the one that you wrote here is it's going to lead us into my first

00:41.160 --> 00:46.640
question because you say you're a software developer who's gone from building really

00:46.640 --> 00:53.000
basic HTML and CSS websites to being a fractional CEO of a startup and a whole lot in between.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.280
So can you tell us about that whole lot in between?

00:57.280 --> 01:00.600
Wow, that's a lot.

01:00.600 --> 01:06.160
Yeah, I mean, so like I said, I'm self-taught.

01:06.160 --> 01:11.160
I started playing around with code when I was in middle school.

01:11.160 --> 01:16.360
I built a website with the website builder, Angelfire.

01:16.360 --> 01:21.240
I doubt most of the listeners will know that, the veterans might.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.960
So but it wasn't good enough.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.080
So I started playing around with it to customize some of the CSS here and there, things like

01:29.080 --> 01:30.080
that.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.420
And then I just kind of fell in love with it.

01:31.420 --> 01:38.200
So ever since I've just been addicted to writing code and building things and customizing things,

01:38.200 --> 01:45.240
back in the day of MySpace, I'd customize everyone's themes for them, things like that.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.560
But yeah, I mean, eventually I got into it as a career.

01:47.560 --> 01:56.760
I used to do audio engineering and used to be a musician, but kind of realized that I

01:56.760 --> 02:06.960
prefer working better hours than running sound at a bar overnight until 4 a.m. or having

02:06.960 --> 02:10.160
a more consistent paycheck.

02:10.160 --> 02:17.200
So I eventually decided to chase development instead, and getting my foot in the door was

02:17.200 --> 02:23.000
pretty tough, not having a degree at that time, especially.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.360
And once I finally got my foot in the door, then it was just, you know, I couldn't stop.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.640
I was working day jobs, I was working on the side, I was doing freelance, I was doing anything

02:33.640 --> 02:38.560
I could to get my hands on some code and might call it a bit of an addiction.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.740
But it was fun.

02:40.740 --> 02:44.600
And I felt like I was trying to compensate for my lack of education.

02:44.600 --> 02:50.840
So I felt like I constantly had to be working on something and learning new technologies.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.120
But yeah, because of that, I've been able to work on a lot of different technologies.

02:54.120 --> 03:00.600
I've been able to work in different industries, hold different positions, part-time, full-time,

03:00.600 --> 03:06.800
contract, freelance, consultant, fractional CTO, all kinds of stuff.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.360
It's just been a wild ride, but it's been a blast.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.360
Yeah, I love that.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.360
That sounds very familiar.

03:11.360 --> 03:14.960
I also used to be a musician before I got into tech.

03:14.960 --> 03:21.280
And kind of switched for the same reason, I couldn't make a decent living enough out

03:21.280 --> 03:22.280
of it.

03:22.280 --> 03:28.360
It was just, I was in classical guitar, and so that's a very niche audience.

03:28.360 --> 03:34.360
And in South Africa, there wasn't a big audience for that and going international is even harder.

03:34.360 --> 03:39.000
So you know, I eventually started toying with tech and then kind of that just one thing

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
led to the other.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.400
I eventually ended up in tech.

03:42.400 --> 03:48.280
So that's a very familiar story to me.

03:48.280 --> 03:52.480
So you've mentioned that you've had access to play with a lot of different technologies

03:52.480 --> 03:57.920
and no kidding, because when I went on your website, you have the section where you can

03:57.920 --> 04:01.840
learn more about the work you've done and then you have this filter by technology.

04:01.840 --> 04:07.200
And I clicked on that and I was like, holy Moses, there's a lot here.

04:07.200 --> 04:12.720
So is this just a side effect of, like you said, you felt you had to like compensate

04:12.720 --> 04:18.000
for the fact you didn't have an official or whatever degree in tech?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.840
Or is it just curiosity that drives you to this?

04:20.840 --> 04:25.280
Yeah, no, it's a bit of both, I think.

04:25.280 --> 04:31.840
What's funny is on my website, that's only the interesting projects that I thought were

04:31.840 --> 04:32.960
worth putting on there.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.360
There's plenty of other ones that I didn't even bother putting on there.

04:36.360 --> 04:41.640
So the amount of technology I've touched is probably even more than that and I've forgotten

04:41.640 --> 04:44.280
half of it.

04:44.280 --> 04:48.200
A lot of it is, yeah, I'm just really fascinated by the technology and I'm always interested

04:48.200 --> 04:53.480
in learning new technology.

04:53.480 --> 05:00.640
I'm not in favor of these tech wars of react versus view or whatever.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.120
I'm not a fan of it.

05:02.120 --> 05:06.040
I think all technologies are great and I think they all have pros and cons.

05:06.040 --> 05:11.280
And I want to play around with all of them, learn all of them just for the heck of it.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.280
And that's part of it.

05:12.280 --> 05:16.560
A part of it is, yeah, feeling like I had to compensate for my lack of education.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.800
At this point, I don't feel like I need to anymore.

05:18.800 --> 05:25.040
But for the first few years of my career, especially, I really felt like I did.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.800
Part of it wasn't exactly my choice either.

05:27.800 --> 05:33.120
One of the jobs I held, almost every project I worked on, they were like, hey, so you've

05:33.120 --> 05:34.120
got this project.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.120
It's in this technology.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.520
Everybody here knows it, so good luck.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.640
And I had to figure it out.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.120
So there was a lot of those that I'm thankful for the experience, but at the time, it was

05:45.120 --> 05:46.120
a bit, it was rough.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.120
Yeah, not for sure.

05:47.120 --> 05:54.000
Having to kind of, and I think that that is the, it comes to this point that I've said

05:54.000 --> 05:57.120
that everybody is a beginner at something at some point.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.000
It doesn't matter how many years experience you have.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.440
And I think that story exemplifies that, where you work on this project and you gain this

06:04.440 --> 06:08.200
experience with these set of technologies, and then somebody comes to you and says, hey,

06:08.200 --> 06:09.200
here's a new project.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.200
Nobody knows what to do.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.200
Good luck with that.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.360
And you feel completely like a newbie again, how you have to learn.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.400
And sometimes it can even be in the same language.

06:16.400 --> 06:22.720
I've told people, the fact that you know JavaScript is going to help you with React, but there

06:22.720 --> 06:28.680
is core concepts of React that is going to trip you up in the beginning, that you need

06:28.680 --> 06:33.480
to, the whole thing of thinking in React, you need to read that part before you jump

06:33.480 --> 06:34.480
into it.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.800
Because it's a, you have to have a mental shift.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.440
And then when you go to view, you kind of have to have a different mental shift again.

06:41.440 --> 06:46.280
Because there's similarities, but there's differences as well, even though the underlying

06:46.280 --> 06:49.480
language is the same for all of them.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.480
Exactly.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.480
Yeah.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.760
I mean, I, when I, you know, my early days, I was working in JavaScript with jQuery for

06:54.760 --> 06:55.760
a long time.

06:55.760 --> 07:02.040
And so making that transition from jQuery to View or React or whatever, it was a complete

07:02.040 --> 07:05.600
180 in how I had to think about how to do things.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.460
And at one point I ended up having to go back to a project that was on jQuery after spending

07:09.460 --> 07:11.880
years working in View.

07:11.880 --> 07:12.880
And it was rough.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.040
I've forgotten how to think that way.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.940
And I kept trying to do things in the View way with jQuery, and it just doesn't work

07:19.940 --> 07:21.520
that way.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.520
So yeah, it is.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.640
It's same language, but entirely different experience.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.760
Yeah.

07:26.760 --> 07:32.720
I found myself often when I'm in a, let's say I'm in a lot of JavaScript project, wanting

07:32.720 --> 07:37.400
to reach for a use state look, and I'm like, oh wait, that doesn't exist here.

07:37.400 --> 07:41.640
You have to manage state differently.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.760
Yeah.

07:43.760 --> 07:49.480
So one of the other things I saw is that you mentioned the words, Indie hacking.

07:49.480 --> 07:55.840
And I'm really interested in that whole ecosystem, like the Indie web and this idea of owning

07:55.840 --> 08:02.360
your own content, running your own website, having your own domain, and then basically

08:02.360 --> 08:08.800
sharing to the social networks, but the social networks is not where you post.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
That's where you share.

08:09.800 --> 08:14.600
And I kind of think that's kind of what social media was really for, but it turned into like

08:14.600 --> 08:16.640
it became where people's content live.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.640
And then if one of these platforms goes away, people are like, oh my goodness, all my content's

08:20.640 --> 08:22.680
gone.

08:22.680 --> 08:29.280
And then another thing that you said is that on your Twitter profile, it says like you

08:29.280 --> 08:31.040
make everything in the open.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.520
So those two are very closely related.

08:32.520 --> 08:39.040
Do you want to dig a little bit into the concepts of Indie web and making things in the open?

08:39.040 --> 08:40.040
Sure.

08:40.040 --> 08:41.040
Yeah.

08:41.040 --> 08:44.440
And maybe also with the angle of how has that helped you in your career?

08:44.440 --> 08:46.960
I think that might be interesting to know as well.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.960
Definitely.

08:47.960 --> 08:48.960
Yeah.

08:48.960 --> 08:54.920
I don't remember how I stumbled upon the Indie hacking community.

08:54.920 --> 09:00.320
It was through Twitter, but I think it was just, I don't know, trying to find tech-based

09:00.320 --> 09:04.860
people that were interesting and then over time it eventually kind of led into that.

09:04.860 --> 09:11.440
But somehow now I'm kind of inundated with the Indie hacker community really, and it's

09:11.440 --> 09:12.440
pretty great.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.520
They're all very supportive.

09:13.520 --> 09:20.680
So yeah, a lot of things are based around, for example, the website IndieHackers.com.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.920
Cortlandt Allen built that and eventually Stripe acquired it.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.840
He still runs it.

09:26.840 --> 09:32.840
And it's a really cool resource to let Indie hackers, bootstrappers be able to just kind

09:32.840 --> 09:37.820
of share their information, share their stories, their successes, their failures, what they

09:37.820 --> 09:39.920
learned from that, things like that.

09:39.920 --> 09:46.160
And that's what I like about it is it's different than just my whole career.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.240
Like I said, I've been playing around with technology.

09:48.240 --> 09:53.360
I've built who knows how many things just because they were useless things, but they

09:53.360 --> 09:55.040
were just something to build and learn.

09:55.040 --> 10:02.360
And so it kind of shifts that into building something to solve problems, whether it's

10:02.360 --> 10:07.120
solving your own problem, solving someone else's problem that you know.

10:07.120 --> 10:12.320
It's making other people's lives easier by building something interesting.

10:12.320 --> 10:18.480
And that's kind of that's exactly where I want to be as a developer is the most rewarding

10:18.480 --> 10:23.560
and the most enjoyable thing for me is I want to build something that makes someone else's

10:23.560 --> 10:25.820
life easier.

10:25.820 --> 10:30.240
And so that's what got me sucked into it.

10:30.240 --> 10:36.160
And so I started playing around building different web apps, different, a few different projects

10:36.160 --> 10:37.680
here and there.

10:37.680 --> 10:43.160
And the thing about the community is everyone, you know, a lot of people share, everybody

10:43.160 --> 10:46.860
shares different levels of information, but everybody in that community is pretty open

10:46.860 --> 10:49.320
about their startup and what they're doing.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.760
Some of them share screenshots of their revenue every month.

10:52.760 --> 10:57.840
And some of them, you know, just show like this is the technology I'm using or this is

10:57.840 --> 11:03.080
the problem I had or this was an experience I had with someone reaching out to customer

11:03.080 --> 11:05.760
service and how I solved it.

11:05.760 --> 11:11.840
Everything you don't the thing about building in public and with the indie community is

11:11.840 --> 11:15.680
you don't have to follow a specific rule set.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.320
It's whatever you want to share, share and everybody's just kind of there to help each

11:19.320 --> 11:22.600
other and you learn from everyone's experience.

11:22.600 --> 11:27.280
So you know, that's kind of what got me into it and how I was able to learn a lot from

11:27.280 --> 11:34.760
them and hopefully was able to bypass some mistakes, common mistakes because I learned

11:34.760 --> 11:38.840
from other people who had already made those mistakes.

11:38.840 --> 11:48.640
Now as far as how that's helped me in my career, I think that could go a few different ways.

11:48.640 --> 11:54.000
In one side, a lot, I see a lot of indie hackers say that because they've started their own

11:54.000 --> 11:58.240
business and ran their own business, they now consider themselves unhireable.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.920
And for some people, that's their goal.

12:00.920 --> 12:07.280
They want to be unhireable because they just either can't imagine being reporting to a

12:07.280 --> 12:14.880
boss, you know, or they just can't deal with the day in, day out of the office work or

12:14.880 --> 12:19.680
whatever the situation is, a lot of people in that community, that's their goal.

12:19.680 --> 12:26.480
For me, it's just been a way to expand my knowledge and my experience of the community,

12:26.480 --> 12:31.320
of the technologies, of new ways of looking at how to build things.

12:31.320 --> 12:36.720
I've been able to bring those experiences into my work and say, hey, I learned something

12:36.720 --> 12:45.160
new about React or why don't we think about the customer in this mindset or anything from

12:45.160 --> 12:50.040
technology to just the critical thinking about how you think about things.

12:50.040 --> 12:57.220
And I think it can help you see things from your leader's perspective.

12:57.220 --> 13:03.400
So whether that's your direct boss, manager, or if that's the CEO, CTO of the company,

13:03.400 --> 13:07.400
whatever that situation is, I think it can help you see things from their perspective.

13:07.400 --> 13:14.360
Having attempted to run your own small thing, startup, whatever you want to call it, you

13:14.360 --> 13:18.680
can kind of see like, oh, okay, I understand these pain points or I understand that they

13:18.680 --> 13:22.160
have to consider all of these different things.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.600
It's not as straightforward as I thought.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.720
So yeah, I think it can help in a lot of different ways.

13:26.720 --> 13:28.800
Yeah, that's the last part.

13:28.800 --> 13:37.400
A friend of mine, Peter, oftentimes when we've had problems and you have these different

13:37.400 --> 13:43.440
potential avenues and you maybe don't understand why you would choose one over the other, he's

13:43.440 --> 13:49.400
often said, imagine that you and your buddy in a garage trying to build something and

13:49.400 --> 13:53.520
you got a million dollars, how would you spend it?

13:53.520 --> 13:55.120
Think about it from that perspective.

13:55.120 --> 13:59.440
And that's a good thing because now you can put yourself in that situation.

13:59.440 --> 14:03.960
If this was my product and I had a million dollars and it's only the two of us, so we

14:03.960 --> 14:09.400
have constraints of finances and we have the constraints if it's only the two of us, which

14:09.400 --> 14:13.640
of these things would you have invested in if it was your company?

14:13.640 --> 14:14.880
So I think it is great.

14:14.880 --> 14:20.560
I think what I'm curious about is the unhireable aspect of that.

14:20.560 --> 14:27.600
Is that like just because you turn more and more into a cat and it's less able to be heard,

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
you know, herding cats?

14:28.600 --> 14:32.000
Is it that you turn more into a cat and so it's too hard to herd you?

14:32.000 --> 14:35.200
So employers are like, ah, go and work with this guy.

14:35.200 --> 14:41.560
Or is it just that literally working a nine to five, doing the same thing is just going

14:41.560 --> 14:44.320
to be soul crushing?

14:44.320 --> 14:49.200
I think it's more of the latter for a lot of people.

14:49.200 --> 14:54.400
The way I understood it, the way I take it when I hear people talk about that is that

14:54.400 --> 15:02.100
they I guess they imagined that it would be too impossible for an employer to satisfy

15:02.100 --> 15:05.780
all of their needs to be able to hire them.

15:05.780 --> 15:11.200
So they might have a high set of requirements now of, yeah, well, you know, my time is my

15:11.200 --> 15:12.200
own now.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.120
So I'm considered free.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.520
So I'm going to need to be able to work whatever hours I want.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.120
I'm going to need to be able to have this, you know, who knows how big of a salary.

15:21.120 --> 15:26.560
I'm going to need the freedom to work wherever I want, whenever I want.

15:26.560 --> 15:30.360
And who knows what other requirements they might have.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.360
So I don't know.

15:31.360 --> 15:36.160
I think that might be part of the unhireable approach or mindset.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.760
But again, I think it might be different for everybody.

15:38.760 --> 15:42.680
Some people might just be that they can no longer even imagine going back to working

15:42.680 --> 15:43.680
the nine to five.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.480
It's too soul crushing for them or whatever.

15:46.480 --> 15:52.440
That's interesting, because I've also been doing the hackers on the website, but I haven't

15:52.440 --> 15:55.080
in a while.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.440
I need to get back there because it is an inspiring place.

15:58.440 --> 16:07.640
Do you think, do you see like, because I discovered, I found out about you through Polywork.

16:07.640 --> 16:11.560
And this is how this conversation happened.

16:11.560 --> 16:21.760
So do you think Polywork is like, Polywork and IndieHackers, are they like birds of the

16:21.760 --> 16:26.320
same feather or are they mutually exclusive?

16:26.320 --> 16:28.240
I'm trying to think.

16:28.240 --> 16:32.000
I so I don't use Polywork a whole lot.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.400
Most of that is because I just forget to do things like that to go and look at these communities.

16:38.400 --> 16:43.760
I'm terrible about keeping up with social media and being involved with the communities.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.680
But I want to I just I never take the time to do it.

16:46.680 --> 16:53.440
So from my perspective, I think that they're they're somewhat independent.

16:53.440 --> 17:02.680
But Polywork to me is what LinkedIn should have been for people who are IndieHackers,

17:02.680 --> 17:04.720
but not just IndieHackers.

17:04.720 --> 17:09.560
But I think it's better than LinkedIn for people who are IndieHackers or other similar

17:09.560 --> 17:14.800
things where basically you have the whole concept behind it is you're not just one job,

17:14.800 --> 17:18.600
you know, you're not one title, you have all these different roles, whether you're on the

17:18.600 --> 17:24.960
board at another company or whether you're doing freelance or you're running three startups

17:24.960 --> 17:26.960
or whatever.

17:26.960 --> 17:31.080
I think Polywork is a lot more inclusive for those types of roles.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.680
So I think it's helpful for IndieHackers, but I don't necessarily think they're dependent

17:34.680 --> 17:35.680
on each other.

17:35.680 --> 17:36.680
Okay.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.680
Yeah, that's a good point of view.

17:37.680 --> 17:38.960
I agree with that.

17:38.960 --> 17:47.240
And I didn't realize that I didn't connect this poly aspect of the poly work with what

17:47.240 --> 17:52.760
you just said until I saw the very first video they posted on the YouTube channel where the

17:52.760 --> 17:56.720
founder of Polywork talked about what the idea behind Polywork is.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.400
And he talked about exactly that.

17:58.400 --> 18:03.200
Like you're undefined by a single role or a single title.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.800
You are multi like what's another TED Talker multi potentialite.

18:07.800 --> 18:12.280
You have all these potentials and you have all these things that you're doing.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.240
And then I was like, gotcha, that makes a lot of sense.

18:15.240 --> 18:21.680
And yeah, I do think like the LinkedIn for IndieHackers, it does sound like a very good

18:21.680 --> 18:24.240
analogy of what it is.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.240
I'm enjoying it and I'm trying to use it more and more.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.960
And I know they're investing quite a bit in the platform and really trying to grow it.

18:29.960 --> 18:34.360
And I wish them all the best of success.

18:34.360 --> 18:42.200
This podcast exists largely because of the amazing people I got that just offered to

18:42.200 --> 18:46.360
come on the podcast, even though it didn't even exist.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.520
So I'm thankful for that.

18:48.520 --> 18:54.080
So I read that you were also considered yourself primarily a backend developer, but then more

18:54.080 --> 18:57.820
and more you found yourself leaning towards front end and especially JavaScript was one

18:57.820 --> 19:01.220
of the things that drew you to the front end.

19:01.220 --> 19:07.240
So what are the things about JavaScript that got you really excited and maybe that you're

19:07.240 --> 19:12.240
looking that you enjoy at the moment that you're really excited about right now in the

19:12.240 --> 19:14.960
world and maybe things that's like on the horizon?

19:14.960 --> 19:16.760
Yeah, yeah, sure.

19:16.760 --> 19:22.360
So yeah, I mean, most of my experience has been full stack and I usually would lean more

19:22.360 --> 19:24.900
towards the backend, like you said.

19:24.900 --> 19:30.200
The front end, I don't mind it, but I'm just not a very visual person.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.160
So I'm not great at the UI, UX kind of stuff.

19:33.160 --> 19:37.920
I need someone else like a designer to kind of help me along with those things.

19:37.920 --> 19:42.200
But otherwise, front end can be enjoyable whenever it's more about the logic and things

19:42.200 --> 19:43.240
like that.

19:43.240 --> 19:49.520
So what excites me about JavaScript, I love as a full stack developer, I love that I can

19:49.520 --> 19:52.560
use the same language full stack.

19:52.560 --> 19:58.800
It's super exciting now that Node is becoming so popular and frameworks like Nuxt and Next

19:58.800 --> 20:04.400
JS are out there where you can build your full stack all in the same project with the

20:04.400 --> 20:05.400
same language.

20:05.400 --> 20:11.280
And if you're using things like TypeScript, you can have full stack type safety and things

20:11.280 --> 20:12.280
like that.

20:12.280 --> 20:16.360
It's really, really cool to be able to have this cohesive system instead of, well, I've

20:16.360 --> 20:21.320
got to have this one environment for my backend with Python, PHP, Go, whatever.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.520
And then this other entirely different environment for front end, which you can still do.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.480
And it's still great if you want to do that.

20:27.480 --> 20:31.600
But the convenience of being able to do it all together in one language, it's really

20:31.600 --> 20:32.600
cool.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.600
Yeah, that's very true.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.600
It is freeing.

20:35.600 --> 20:41.360
I definitely always saw myself as more of a front end developer, but when Node came along,

20:41.360 --> 20:44.320
it opened up avenues that I didn't have before.

20:44.320 --> 20:50.080
And to some extent, I still see myself as primarily front end, but I definitely can

20:50.080 --> 20:52.600
do the full stack, that's for sure.

20:52.600 --> 20:59.920
I do build projects for some folks that do use Prisma and MongoDB, and it's doing that

20:59.920 --> 21:02.920
all through Node.

21:02.920 --> 21:11.920
So there's some talk, a proposal from Microsoft about bringing the core concepts of TypeScript

21:11.920 --> 21:12.920
to JavaScript.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.600
It's a bit of a hard topic.

21:15.600 --> 21:20.620
Do you think that's a good idea, or do you think it should be rather two separate things

21:20.620 --> 21:21.620
that you...

21:21.620 --> 21:23.160
Well, the thing is the way that they are...

21:23.160 --> 21:28.200
Because that is a thing you can't just change JavaScript to be a typed language, right?

21:28.200 --> 21:31.720
Because there's way too much code out there that'll break.

21:31.720 --> 21:36.900
That's always the thing with JavaScript is you have to be so careful how you introduce

21:36.900 --> 21:39.860
new features that you don't break things going back.

21:39.860 --> 21:46.280
So it looks to me, if what I've read from the proposal is that it's almost like this

21:46.280 --> 21:52.160
JS doc style type of thing where you use annotations, and it's just that that becomes part of the

21:52.160 --> 21:55.400
core language as opposed to it being a TypeScript thing.

21:55.400 --> 22:00.960
Do you think that would be good to have it part of the JavaScript language and therefore

22:00.960 --> 22:05.680
part of ECMA and the standards body as opposed to this thing that Microsoft runs?

22:05.680 --> 22:06.960
Well, that's really interesting.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.480
I hadn't heard that.

22:09.480 --> 22:17.840
I mean, I think what you said is pretty much right on it is, sure, it would be really cool

22:17.840 --> 22:21.720
to have that, but man, that would break so much stuff.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.040
So yeah, finding that right balance.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.880
I mean, I guess PHP did similar things, right?

22:26.880 --> 22:33.400
So they started implementing strict types, and you could optionally on each PHP file,

22:33.400 --> 22:38.440
you could optionally put strict type enabled at the top of it, and it would force it.

22:38.440 --> 22:44.680
And it would throw compiling errors basically if it didn't match the types, which I started

22:44.680 --> 22:51.680
doing eventually and started forcing all my code to be strictly typed in PHP, but it didn't

22:51.680 --> 22:56.320
break things before that because you had to explicitly enable it per file.

22:56.320 --> 23:02.120
And then eventually maybe moving into having that by default enabled over time could be

23:02.120 --> 23:03.280
useful.

23:03.280 --> 23:08.120
So I think if JavaScript were able to implement something like that, I think it could be cool.

23:08.120 --> 23:13.280
I mean, I think having the type safety in JavaScript helps a lot, and I think it's really

23:13.280 --> 23:14.280
useful.

23:14.280 --> 23:20.480
I think it does make the learning curve much higher for newer developers.

23:20.480 --> 23:24.080
So that's a bit dangerous.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.520
JavaScript is such a common language right now, and it's so easy to be able to tell newer

23:27.520 --> 23:29.280
developers, yeah, just play around JavaScript.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.440
You can pretty much guarantee to get a job.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.080
You can play with it directly in the browser.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.760
You can test it around very easily.

23:36.760 --> 23:41.040
And don't worry about TypeScript at first, because first you just need to learn how to

23:41.040 --> 23:45.880
write in a programming language, and doing TypeScript I think could be overwhelming to

23:45.880 --> 23:47.360
someone who's new.

23:47.360 --> 23:50.280
So I mean, I don't know.

23:50.280 --> 23:56.120
That's a really interesting concept, but personally I would love it, but I don't think as a whole

23:56.120 --> 23:58.360
I don't think it might be the best idea.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.440
Yeah, I agree with that.

24:01.440 --> 24:05.600
That is also the concern for me is because I can't remember if it was a question I wanted

24:05.600 --> 24:12.080
to ask somebody or whether it is something I did pose to someone.

24:12.080 --> 24:20.120
But I was asking this question, when do you start introducing TypeScript to new developers?

24:20.120 --> 24:21.720
When is the right time?

24:21.720 --> 24:25.200
And it's pretty far down the line as far as I'm concerned.

24:25.200 --> 24:28.440
There's quite a lot in JavaScript to just wrap your head around.

24:28.440 --> 24:34.320
If you don't understand the whole idea of closures and the whole idea of how you do

24:34.320 --> 24:37.880
functional programming in JavaScript, because that seems to be like where JavaScript is

24:37.880 --> 24:45.640
moving more and more, then adding types on top of that, it's going to be...

24:45.640 --> 24:52.240
I think one of the nice things about frontend, but just web in general, is how approachable

24:52.240 --> 24:54.400
it is.

24:54.400 --> 25:03.160
It's not easy, but it's definitely easier than trying to get into like an enterprise

25:03.160 --> 25:06.080
level language as your first language.

25:06.080 --> 25:09.800
Yeah, the entry point is a lot lower.

25:09.800 --> 25:18.080
You can do quite a bit without having to have this breadth of programming experience.

25:18.080 --> 25:24.160
I think it's almost like you can already now, if you write some JavaScript and it's not

25:24.160 --> 25:28.800
like using ESM, then you can put the little use strict at the top.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.440
And then it tells the JavaScript parser, hey, if you're running into a thing, just don't

25:32.440 --> 25:33.440
try and help me.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.360
Just throw an error, which is like PHP, like you said.

25:36.360 --> 25:41.440
So maybe though, if this comes to pass, maybe it'll be something like that.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.480
Maybe we'll have a type annotation to say, add type safe or something, and then it kicks

25:45.480 --> 25:48.320
into a different JavaScript engine.

25:48.320 --> 25:54.880
It would have to be an optional opt-in that over time, we could potentially move to be

25:54.880 --> 26:01.560
default to true, but for now, for a long time, it would have to be something like that, yeah.

26:01.560 --> 26:11.000
So another tricky potentially question, what do you see as the biggest challenges in tech?

26:11.000 --> 26:15.720
Yeah, that's a great question.

26:15.720 --> 26:20.240
Specifically in web development too, I think this applies more so in web development than

26:20.240 --> 26:22.920
most other areas, although maybe not.

26:22.920 --> 26:28.000
I don't have that much experience outside of web, but analysis paralysis.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.600
I think there are way too many cool tools in web development and technologies, programming

26:34.600 --> 26:39.600
languages, frameworks, whatever, that how do you decide what to use for each project?

26:39.600 --> 26:44.960
And do you keep using the same thing or do you use the new shiny thing every day?

26:44.960 --> 26:47.040
There's just too much of that.

26:47.040 --> 26:51.960
And it's great, but it is super overwhelming, especially for newer developers.

26:51.960 --> 26:57.000
But even today, I struggle with that regularly of if I'm starting a new project, oh, I would

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
love to play around with this new cool technology, but I could use the same thing that's safe,

27:03.000 --> 27:07.920
I know it, and I could do it a lot faster and it would be a better end result because

27:07.920 --> 27:10.240
I know it so well.

27:10.240 --> 27:16.600
So I think that's one of the big challenges and kind of along the same lines is it changes

27:16.600 --> 27:17.760
so rapidly.

27:17.760 --> 27:24.800
Every day there's something new or things are updated every day where new features or

27:24.800 --> 27:32.080
deprecated or whatever, the rapid changing of the front end technologies is it can feel

27:32.080 --> 27:37.560
overwhelming to keep up with whether you're an early stage developer or a veteran, especially

27:37.560 --> 27:39.400
in the front end.

27:39.400 --> 27:45.120
And for me, I think those are two of the biggest challenges.

27:45.120 --> 27:54.320
So do you have any strategies for how to safely drink from the fire hose?

27:54.320 --> 28:06.760
I for me, it's been so as an indie hacker, you know, they always say, don't go with a

28:06.760 --> 28:10.640
new shiny, go with what you know, the best framework to build your project in is the

28:10.640 --> 28:13.720
thing that you know the best, whatever you're most comfortable in.

28:13.720 --> 28:17.600
And, you know, majority of the time, that is true.

28:17.600 --> 28:27.920
I think that's a great case unless your plan or your goal is to expand your portfolio of

28:27.920 --> 28:30.700
technology for your resume or whatever.

28:30.700 --> 28:33.960
If that's your goal, then sure, learn something new.

28:33.960 --> 28:37.620
But for the most case, I think it's whatever you already know.

28:37.620 --> 28:44.600
But if you're jumping in brand new and you don't know anything, what I found is jumping

28:44.600 --> 28:50.760
into if you have resources, if you have contacts of somebody who's already in that field, maybe

28:50.760 --> 28:54.720
learning something that they know, so that they can be a mentor, or at least just be

28:54.720 --> 28:58.140
a source of support.

28:58.140 --> 29:02.040
And then from there, you can branch out to whatever kind of comes your way.

29:02.040 --> 29:09.440
For me, most of the technology I learned was a result of either somebody I knew or a job

29:09.440 --> 29:11.380
I got.

29:11.380 --> 29:18.160
And so it was not always my choice, but I got led down these paths because those are

29:18.160 --> 29:21.000
the doors that opened to me.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.680
And then some of the other ones, I kind of forced open myself because I would spend who

29:24.680 --> 29:29.800
knows how many hours trying to learn new things because I wanted to learn it.

29:29.800 --> 29:37.160
But I mean, that's how I spent half of my career in the e-commerce framework Magento.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.120
It was one of those projects at that job where they were like, well, we don't have a Magento

29:40.120 --> 29:44.160
person and we have a new Magento project, so you win.

29:44.160 --> 29:51.400
And from then on, I was the Magento guy because I terribly built a website in Magento.

29:51.400 --> 29:57.600
And five, six years later, no, four or five years later, I don't know.

29:57.600 --> 30:03.640
I got a job as a Magento developer across the ocean in an entirely new continent.

30:03.640 --> 30:09.160
And got to come over to France and work a job there as the Magento guy at this company.

30:09.160 --> 30:14.160
And after that, I kind of decided I'm done with Magento.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.560
I'm ready to go back to building tools.

30:16.560 --> 30:21.620
Like I said, I want to build tools that people use and not e-commerce or marketing things.

30:21.620 --> 30:27.200
So I kind of got out of that eventually, but that experience helped me get to where I am.

30:27.200 --> 30:34.120
So yeah, I kind of went off on a tangent there, but that's all good, that's all good.

30:34.120 --> 30:40.480
So to go further off on a tangent, there's two tools that I've seen that you've built

30:40.480 --> 30:42.480
that really intrigues me.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.920
And one is really funny.

30:43.920 --> 30:50.100
And I can totally understand why you created that because I've heard so many developer

30:50.100 --> 30:53.080
stories about how many domain names do you own?

30:53.080 --> 30:57.160
And it's like, let me pull up my spreadsheet and see where I'm up to.

30:57.160 --> 31:01.240
And I've also got probably more than I use.

31:01.240 --> 31:05.600
So the two tools I'm talking about, the one is completely different, but I'm curious about

31:05.600 --> 31:06.600
that one.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.200
And that's My Cosplace.

31:08.200 --> 31:12.260
And then the other one is Domain Goalie, which is such a cool name.

31:12.260 --> 31:14.040
If you want to talk about those two.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.040
Yeah.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.720
So Domain Goalie, exactly.

31:16.720 --> 31:19.720
It's a silly product.

31:19.720 --> 31:24.760
So yeah, we all know the joke, the running joke of developers and indie hackers both

31:24.760 --> 31:27.220
of we have way too many domains.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.940
We're kind of obsessed with buying them.

31:28.940 --> 31:32.840
We have a graveyard of dead projects that we never finished, but we bought the domain

31:32.840 --> 31:35.200
for it.

31:35.200 --> 31:39.320
And it's just a running joke because it's true for a lot of us.

31:39.320 --> 31:46.160
And I think one day I saw somebody on Twitter post something like, can I hire someone to

31:46.160 --> 31:51.320
insult me every time I try to buy a domain or something silly like that.

31:51.320 --> 31:52.380
And I just thought it was so funny.

31:52.380 --> 31:58.040
And I thought, well, I mean, I can't be there to watch over your shoulder, but a browser

31:58.040 --> 32:00.980
extension can be.

32:00.980 --> 32:04.480
So I just spent like a couple hours that evening like, hey, I've never built a browser extension.

32:04.480 --> 32:07.080
Let's figure out how to do that.

32:07.080 --> 32:12.680
And just played around, built a super simple, silly browser extension that basically just

32:12.680 --> 32:17.920
it's right now it only supports a few of the main websites where you buy domains, but it

32:17.920 --> 32:22.040
checks to see if you're trying to buy a domain and it shows a pop up that basically tries

32:22.040 --> 32:27.240
to talk sense into you to kind of say like, hey, will you be spending time on this in

32:27.240 --> 32:28.240
two years?

32:28.240 --> 32:31.800
Like, is this really worth your money right now?

32:31.800 --> 32:34.840
And I mean, you know, it's not really useful.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.640
It's kind of annoying, but it's just a fun little thing.

32:38.640 --> 32:42.200
And I think I've got like one person using it.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.440
And it is what it is.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.880
It was just a fun response of like, hey, I built this in case you want to use it kind

32:47.880 --> 32:48.880
of thing.

32:48.880 --> 32:52.060
Yeah, that's, that's hilarious, but it's cool.

32:52.060 --> 32:55.040
I like how that often leads you down the wrong path.

32:55.040 --> 32:58.240
Like exactly here, it was a case of, I've never built a browser extension.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.640
Let me see what that's all about.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.280
And here's a project that we can talk about.

33:03.280 --> 33:08.260
And so my cosplays, how does, how did that come about?

33:08.260 --> 33:14.440
So yeah, my wife and I, we go to conventions like Dragon Con, similar to Comic Con, but

33:14.440 --> 33:15.440
other ones.

33:15.440 --> 33:19.720
And we usually will cosplay, we'll dress up in costume of different characters.

33:19.720 --> 33:22.680
So my wife is great at making those cosplays.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.560
I just put them on and wear them.

33:25.560 --> 33:32.440
But one of the most annoying things about that is the hours, days, weeks you'll spend

33:32.440 --> 33:35.520
afterwards searching for photos of yourself.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.900
And a lot of times there are Facebook groups where people will just dump their hundreds

33:38.900 --> 33:42.440
or thousands of photos they took and you'll just scroll through all of them trying to

33:42.440 --> 33:44.440
find them.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.720
And you know, it's annoying, but it is what it is.

33:47.720 --> 33:52.440
And I've also found like at a lot of photo shoots at conventions, a lot of us would spend

33:52.440 --> 33:56.080
time afterwards just looking each other up on our phones on Instagram right then and

33:56.080 --> 34:00.960
there, following each other so we could post, you know, photos of each other.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.720
And I just thought there's got to be a better way to do this.

34:03.720 --> 34:10.280
So I decided it was, I think a year ago at the convention, I kind of thought, all right,

34:10.280 --> 34:13.600
I want to, I want to think about this, see if I can find a way to make this easier for

34:13.600 --> 34:14.600
us.

34:14.600 --> 34:19.520
And so my first thought was, yeah, business cards would be cool, having pictures of you

34:19.520 --> 34:24.440
and your cosplays on the business cards so that way the person won't forget, they're

34:24.440 --> 34:26.720
going to take hundreds of photos at that convention.

34:26.720 --> 34:28.760
They're going to forget who gave them that card.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.680
And the problem with that is every year you're going to have new cosplays.

34:31.680 --> 34:36.240
I have some friends, one of my friends last year brought, this year brought 16 cosplays.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.960
I mean, there's no way he's going to fit all those photos on a card.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.560
And then every year he'd have to get new cards printed.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.180
So it's not, that's not really reasonable.

34:44.180 --> 34:49.180
So then I thought, you know, a digital portfolio you can update whenever you want.

34:49.180 --> 34:51.280
But how do you connect that?

34:51.280 --> 34:55.240
And so then I thought, well, okay, QR codes, QR codes have been really popular, especially

34:55.240 --> 34:57.240
through COVID.

34:57.240 --> 35:02.960
They've kind of made a comeback because of the pandemic, I think, especially within Europe,

35:02.960 --> 35:04.700
at least.

35:04.700 --> 35:11.760
So I thought, okay, build a portfolio, get a QR code that points to that portfolio.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.400
You can also have all your links to social media accounts.

35:14.400 --> 35:18.040
So it's kind of like a link tree with a portfolio combined.

35:18.040 --> 35:22.840
And then you can get business cards with a couple photos of your cosplays on them and

35:22.840 --> 35:24.620
then that QR code.

35:24.620 --> 35:30.000
So people can either at that moment scan the QR code and go to your website, or they can

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
take the card.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.200
And then later, if they forget who you were, they can scan it and find a photo of the cosplay

35:34.200 --> 35:36.500
that you were in.

35:36.500 --> 35:40.360
And so I thought, okay, maybe that'll kind of connect everything.

35:40.360 --> 35:45.080
So yeah, I built my cosplays as a way to try and do all of that.

35:45.080 --> 35:50.000
This year at DragonCon was my first year really getting to try it out.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.080
In the meantime, I've had a few other users test it out at a couple other conventions,

35:54.080 --> 35:55.080
one in...

35:55.080 --> 36:00.720
Oh, I've completely lost where it was.

36:00.720 --> 36:01.720
So nevermind.

36:01.720 --> 36:08.360
Anyway, it was somewhere here in Europe, I can't remember now.

36:08.360 --> 36:13.840
So I've seen a few people try it out, and then I tested it out this year at DragonCon.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.880
To be honest, I didn't get the reaction I thought it would.

36:17.880 --> 36:21.680
It still seems to be missing something that really...

36:21.680 --> 36:28.520
I think either people don't see its relevance or don't see its value right away.

36:28.520 --> 36:34.120
So whether or not it's missing a feature or if it's missing just clear communication,

36:34.120 --> 36:35.600
haven't quite figured that out yet.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.520
But I think it's on the right track.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.920
And I've got a group of friends who we all cosplay together and I've gotten a lot of

36:42.920 --> 36:47.440
feedback from them about it and what they thought it was when they first saw it or what

36:47.440 --> 36:49.480
they expect it to be.

36:49.480 --> 36:52.200
So I think it'll continue to change.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.800
There might be more of a social platform aspect to it.

36:55.800 --> 37:02.760
A lot of cosplayers seem to use Facebook groups, but a lot of people hate using Facebook now.

37:02.760 --> 37:05.400
I mean, there's a lot of drama around that.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.800
So a lot of people don't want to be on the platform, but Facebook groups is really the

37:08.800 --> 37:13.400
only place they can find that experience or those cosplay groups.

37:13.400 --> 37:19.360
So maybe finding a way to implement a way for them to replace Facebook groups with this

37:19.360 --> 37:22.080
platform might be useful.

37:22.080 --> 37:25.280
Just some different ideas I'm playing with right now.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.280
Yeah.

37:26.280 --> 37:37.720
I've totally heard talk about this idea that there is a need for very niche social networks.

37:37.720 --> 37:46.920
And I think Web3 is an interesting topic that has multiple angles and depending on which

37:46.920 --> 37:51.880
angle you approach it at, you'll have different people respond in different ways.

37:51.880 --> 37:57.640
I think some of the underlying core concepts that has been forgotten isn't a bad idea.

37:57.640 --> 38:06.000
The whole idea of being decentralized, owning what you make, forming smaller groups, I think

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
those are good ideas.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.720
And I think that might be where it plays into because things like Mastodon and stuff like

38:11.720 --> 38:17.800
that, where you can spin up your own little version of Twitter in a sense, but for a very

38:17.800 --> 38:19.000
niche community.

38:19.000 --> 38:25.800
And you can cross-link it between other Mastodon instances that is relevant, but different

38:25.800 --> 38:28.100
enough to have their own niche.

38:28.100 --> 38:31.280
So I think maybe you're onto something here.

38:31.280 --> 38:35.880
I think maybe the cosplay community would like this.

38:35.880 --> 38:42.280
Yeah, honestly, I was against it being anything similar to a social platform for a while.

38:42.280 --> 38:45.200
I kept pushing back on that.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.800
Part of that is I just didn't want to deal with a social platform.

38:48.800 --> 38:54.480
There's always so much stuff that you have to deal with that with moderators and just

38:54.480 --> 38:58.420
the worst people always ruin it for everybody else.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.520
So I didn't want to deal with that.

39:00.520 --> 39:04.760
But also I just kept thinking, there's so many great social platforms out there.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.280
Who's going to want to use this random one that I built?

39:07.280 --> 39:09.400
I mean, who am I kidding?

39:09.400 --> 39:12.920
I'm not going to be able to compete with a platform like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,

39:12.920 --> 39:15.640
things like that, nor do I want to.

39:15.640 --> 39:21.480
But your point kind of has been what you just said has been made clear to me, I think by

39:21.480 --> 39:26.960
multiple people who I've tried talking to about my cosplays is, yeah, well, they want

39:26.960 --> 39:31.880
a more specific platform that is dedicated to cosplayers and just the cosplay community

39:31.880 --> 39:36.360
wants somewhere to live, basically.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.840
And there are other platforms that I think have been trying to do that.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.080
And so again, I wasn't trying to compete with them.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.080
And if they are doing a good job, great, let's go there.

39:44.080 --> 39:47.920
But so far, I haven't seen any traction on any of them.

39:47.920 --> 39:51.520
Some people have kind of said like, oh, this platform we thought was going to be great,

39:51.520 --> 39:54.480
but it didn't really do what we wanted it to do or whatever.

39:54.480 --> 39:58.360
So yeah, I think maybe there is a want for that.

39:58.360 --> 40:03.440
But I kind of was closed minded about that for a little bit and wasn't open to trying

40:03.440 --> 40:04.440
that.

40:04.440 --> 40:06.520
But I think finally, they've talked me into it.

40:06.520 --> 40:14.080
Yeah, I have a project that I've not abandoned, but it's been definitely put on the back burner

40:14.080 --> 40:15.080
for quite some time.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.520
And it's because of a lot of the same fears.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.880
So that one is a very different audience.

40:20.880 --> 40:28.160
The audience is finding small businesses in your own area and supporting small local businesses.

40:28.160 --> 40:34.560
But I did think that one of the benefits or something like that would be the ability to

40:34.560 --> 40:36.720
review.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.440
And that scares me.

40:38.440 --> 40:45.880
Because now you're opening it up to user comments and I'm like, I don't know if I want to go

40:45.880 --> 40:46.880
down that road.

40:46.880 --> 40:50.240
So I've kind of been, I think that's one of the reasons why I kind of just let the project,

40:50.240 --> 40:52.040
it's live, it's up there.

40:52.040 --> 40:57.000
It's working in a shape and form like I get these stats that four people visited it this

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
week.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.480
Everybody visited this week.

40:59.480 --> 41:00.480
Two people visited this week.

41:00.480 --> 41:05.360
And I'm like, okay, so somehow people are stumbling upon it.

41:05.360 --> 41:08.960
But again, I need to invest time and energy into that.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.520
And I think there needs to be a social aspect to it.

41:11.520 --> 41:12.520
And that scares me.

41:12.520 --> 41:16.520
And I think that's why I've put up something as simple as people being able to upload a

41:16.520 --> 41:18.360
profile photo scares me.

41:18.360 --> 41:22.920
Because now you have to monitor that stuff because people can upload anything as their

41:22.920 --> 41:23.920
profile picture.

41:23.920 --> 41:27.360
Now you have to go think like, what machine learning thing can I put in?

41:27.360 --> 41:28.360
Is it going to be biased?

41:28.360 --> 41:34.120
Is it going to flag stuff that is actually fine, but the data set it's been trained on

41:34.120 --> 41:35.560
is biased.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.160
And that's why it's flagging these things.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.560
And it's causing me more work than it's helping me.

41:39.560 --> 41:43.960
So I think it's those things that as an indie hacker and stuff like that, you often run

41:43.960 --> 41:48.520
into and where you kind of lose steam with the thing because it's just like, oh my goodness,

41:48.520 --> 41:49.520
I don't know.

41:49.520 --> 41:54.840
But again, then I think that's where community comes in, where you can talk about these things

41:54.840 --> 41:55.840
to other indie hackers.

41:55.840 --> 42:00.280
And they might say, hey, you know what, I've actually had that fear, but this is how I

42:00.280 --> 42:01.280
solved it.

42:01.280 --> 42:04.360
And you can be like, oh my goodness, I did not know about this.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.720
So I think that's where community comes into play.

42:07.720 --> 42:11.840
So yeah, well, good luck with those.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.480
I think there's something there.

42:13.480 --> 42:19.840
And I hope it blossoms into something that the cosplay community can be excited about.

42:19.840 --> 42:25.520
Another thing that I'm excited about, because I saw that you posted this in July-ish of

42:25.520 --> 42:32.280
this year, I think is a blogging series about using DevTools for beginners, which is like

42:32.280 --> 42:35.760
perfect for the audience of this podcast.

42:35.760 --> 42:39.400
Two questions.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.000
Why do you see as DevTools?

42:41.000 --> 42:45.520
Because oftentimes when I think DevTools, I think you open command, what's it command

42:45.520 --> 42:51.000
alt I, those DevTools, or do you mean more a broad sense of DevTools?

42:51.000 --> 42:54.680
Yeah, maybe DevTools wasn't the best word to use there.

42:54.680 --> 43:02.680
Yeah, so for me as a self-taught developer, one of the hardest parts, I think, of learning

43:02.680 --> 43:09.080
things was tutorials and courses, things like that, would cover the language or the framework

43:09.080 --> 43:10.080
you're on.

43:10.080 --> 43:14.440
But they would kind of assume that you know how to set up your local development environment

43:14.440 --> 43:20.760
or they might assume that you know how to use package handler or whatever.

43:20.760 --> 43:24.600
And those are the things where it's like, wait, what is this NPM?

43:24.600 --> 43:25.600
What does that even mean?

43:25.600 --> 43:30.240
And then you have to go down rabbit hole after rabbit hole of figuring out how to do these

43:30.240 --> 43:32.660
things and then connecting the pieces.

43:32.660 --> 43:41.920
And I think that that's a part that's sorely lacking in educational content, or at least

43:41.920 --> 43:44.960
it's hard to find it.

43:44.960 --> 43:50.960
So I was considering a while back, I wanted to start writing more, blogging more, I kind

43:50.960 --> 43:55.960
of enjoy doing it and I would like to give back to the development community that's taught

43:55.960 --> 43:57.760
me so much over the years.

43:57.760 --> 44:03.400
And so I asked an early stage developer that I've been mentoring for a while, what his

44:03.400 --> 44:08.240
biggest pain points were, or things that he would love to have more resources about.

44:08.240 --> 44:14.120
And he basically said exactly that, that connecting all those pieces of, yeah, sure, there's teaching

44:14.120 --> 44:17.320
me how to code, but they're not teaching me how to set up my environment so I can be ready

44:17.320 --> 44:20.000
to code or things like that.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.480
And as soon as he said that, it kind of clicked that, oh, yeah, I had that same problem.

44:24.480 --> 44:29.520
It makes sense, I would love to write about something like that then.

44:29.520 --> 44:33.880
To be honest, I haven't, since I posted that, I haven't made any progress, I've been dealing

44:33.880 --> 44:37.000
with a new job and an international move.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.840
So things have been falling a little bit behind schedule, but I'm hoping to get started working

44:41.840 --> 44:45.120
on the actual posts soon.

44:45.120 --> 44:49.320
And I'm also open to, I'm hoping it'll be a growing, living thing.

44:49.320 --> 44:54.680
So I'm open to if somebody asks, you know, hey, could you cover this topic, if it's something

44:54.680 --> 44:59.720
that I'm able to cover, then I'd be happy to add it to the list and to the series and

44:59.720 --> 45:00.720
write about it.

45:00.720 --> 45:01.720
Yeah.

45:01.720 --> 45:02.720
But yeah, I'm excited to do it.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.800
I'm hoping to learn a lot about it while I write too.

45:04.800 --> 45:09.680
Yeah, no, that's one of my, like, again, I've also neglected blogging.

45:09.680 --> 45:13.280
I used to do it in the early days a lot.

45:13.280 --> 45:18.680
And then I kind of stopped, I think I hit a serious case of imposter syndrome and I

45:18.680 --> 45:24.440
was literally too scared to post anything because I was like, what if I'm completely

45:24.440 --> 45:27.360
wrong here and somebody points it out?

45:27.360 --> 45:31.600
Yeah, that's one of the biggest things that's held me back from writing for years.

45:31.600 --> 45:32.600
Yeah.

45:32.600 --> 45:36.480
And also the other thing of there's so much on the internet, what is it going to help

45:36.480 --> 45:39.240
me to just write yet another blog post?

45:39.240 --> 45:40.240
Exactly.

45:40.240 --> 45:46.800
And it's, you know, it's both of those things are like, you're trying to, it's your amygdala

45:46.800 --> 45:49.920
trying to keep you safe.

45:49.920 --> 45:52.360
But there's no real danger here.

45:52.360 --> 45:56.440
But try convincing that little monkey mind that it's wrong.

45:56.440 --> 45:57.440
Exactly.

45:57.440 --> 46:03.620
I mean, that's always been the big thing pushing me back is, yeah, but what do I know?

46:03.620 --> 46:07.240
Because everything I know, I've already learned from the internet, so it's already out there.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.360
When am I going to contribute to that?

46:09.360 --> 46:13.680
But over time, I've had to just learn that I have a unique perspective, just like everyone

46:13.680 --> 46:18.600
else has their own unique perspective given because of their experiences.

46:18.600 --> 46:22.980
And you know, maybe my unique perspective might help one person.

46:22.980 --> 46:24.640
So why not?

46:24.640 --> 46:26.000
Yeah, I agree.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.840
I think that's the key is everybody has a unique way of approaching things and the way

46:30.840 --> 46:35.480
you do it might just be the way that helps somebody else understand it where all the

46:35.480 --> 46:37.920
other things they read, just it didn't click.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.160
I mean, I for the longest time didn't quite click with closures.

46:41.160 --> 46:46.640
And then I followed a course on front end masters where one person was talking about

46:46.640 --> 46:47.640
it.

46:47.640 --> 46:48.640
I can't remember her name now.

46:48.640 --> 46:56.240
But and the way that she explained it was just like, oh, it's actually kind of obvious

46:56.240 --> 46:58.240
now that I understand what it is.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.320
So exactly.

46:59.320 --> 47:03.440
I think the more voices I think the whole talk about diversity, it leads this is part

47:03.440 --> 47:08.520
of it, diverse, diverse voices, I think is important.

47:08.520 --> 47:12.080
Because again, somebody that I also mentor just yesterday told me I don't understand

47:12.080 --> 47:13.600
what the package of JSON is.

47:13.600 --> 47:17.760
And I was like, yeah, right, right, it is kind of confusing, right?

47:17.760 --> 47:20.440
It's this thing that you have in the root folder and you kind of think that you have

47:20.440 --> 47:21.600
to have it.

47:21.600 --> 47:25.280
But you're like, I put it there because it seems like it needs to be there.

47:25.280 --> 47:27.880
But honest to goodness, I don't know what it does.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.880
And so I'd like, I want to dig into it a little bit more.

47:30.880 --> 47:36.560
And I think this is the kind of stuff that you want to cover in your blog series.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.600
Because it is, it is like, what is it?

47:38.600 --> 47:39.600
What's the point of it?

47:39.600 --> 47:41.560
And there is a reason, there's a point for it.

47:41.560 --> 47:46.160
But it's not obvious if you don't go and really dig into it.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.040
And it's actually important to understand what its purpose is.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.040
Right.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.040
Yeah.

47:51.040 --> 47:52.040
So that's super interesting.

47:52.040 --> 47:58.400
So with that, and the fact that you've mentioned that you do mentor folks, what advice do you

47:58.400 --> 48:03.800
have like for early stage web developers, as I like to call it, you know, either from

48:03.800 --> 48:09.400
a technical perspective or a career growth finding work thing or both?

48:09.400 --> 48:10.400
Yeah.

48:10.400 --> 48:17.440
Yeah, I'd say I've got kind of two main things that I usually try to try to tell people.

48:17.440 --> 48:24.020
First of all, build something real, tutorials, courses, things like that are great and all,

48:24.020 --> 48:26.400
but they only go so far.

48:26.400 --> 48:31.920
The first time you have a project where it's, hey, here's a list of requirements or we

48:31.920 --> 48:37.420
want to accomplish XYZ, whatever, and you just have to use critical thinking to figure

48:37.420 --> 48:38.960
out how to build it.

48:38.960 --> 48:44.640
And sure, you can, you know, you're going to Google a lot and you're going to probably

48:44.640 --> 48:48.660
copy a lot of things from Stack Overflow, although preferably you would write it while

48:48.660 --> 48:50.060
reading because it'll stick better.

48:50.060 --> 48:54.520
But either way, you're going to do a lot of that.

48:54.520 --> 48:59.920
And the fact that you had to use critical thinking to connect those pieces and to make

48:59.920 --> 49:05.640
each little piece work together as opposed to just following a course, you're going to

49:05.640 --> 49:13.880
learn wildly more than you would have in months of courses versus one project like that.

49:13.880 --> 49:20.200
It's just, it's going to grow your learning and your experience exponentially.

49:20.200 --> 49:23.400
And I think not only that, but it also helps your portfolio, right?

49:23.400 --> 49:26.760
I mean, there's a portfolio of, hey, I did this.

49:26.760 --> 49:33.680
And as someone who doesn't have a degree, I learned early on that for my resume to even

49:33.680 --> 49:38.160
be considered, I had to have a portfolio of real things that I built.

49:38.160 --> 49:42.880
You know, tutorial things that I built are fine and all, but they don't go very far.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.160
You need to show, hey, I built this thing on my own.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.300
I didn't follow tutorial.

49:46.300 --> 49:48.480
It was my creation.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.440
It doesn't have to be complicated, but just something.

49:51.440 --> 49:56.000
And you know, going into that, the first time we do that, it's going to be overwhelming.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.320
It's going to be terrifying.

49:57.320 --> 50:02.680
You're probably going to think that nobody should pay you right now because of your inexperience

50:02.680 --> 50:07.880
or maybe you don't feel worthy of being paid or you don't think that they will think you're

50:07.880 --> 50:10.520
worthy of being paid or whatever, right?

50:10.520 --> 50:15.640
But I mean, veteran developers have these same thoughts.

50:15.640 --> 50:16.640
It's called imposter syndrome.

50:16.640 --> 50:20.680
Like you already said, we always think about this.

50:20.680 --> 50:24.640
But your first project, now don't lie, you know, be transparent.

50:24.640 --> 50:30.040
I'm an early stage developer, I'm learning, but I'm confident that I will do whatever

50:30.040 --> 50:34.520
it takes to get this done and to build the product that you want.

50:34.520 --> 50:37.080
I'm going to learn a lot along the way.

50:37.080 --> 50:39.980
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm going to figure it out.

50:39.980 --> 50:43.880
And that's kind of the whole point of a job of a developer is figuring it out.

50:43.880 --> 50:49.980
I mean, even now, it's not always just coding, it's figuring it out.

50:49.980 --> 50:55.260
So I think, you know, you have to just push yourself past that and jump on a project and

50:55.260 --> 50:57.880
make sure you can do a free project for some people.

50:57.880 --> 51:01.860
But getting paid for an actual project, whether it's freelance or whatever, even if it's just

51:01.860 --> 51:07.280
a small amount, it, I don't know, it's a world of difference and it makes you feel more confident

51:07.280 --> 51:08.280
too.

51:08.280 --> 51:11.040
And it's just a great feeling of, hey, I built that people are using it.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.040
I got paid for it.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.440
It'll change a lot.

51:14.440 --> 51:18.300
So I think that's a huge milestone for early stage developers that you have to try and

51:18.300 --> 51:21.000
get over as soon as you can.

51:21.000 --> 51:26.760
And the second thing, which kind of ties into the first one is contribute to open source.

51:26.760 --> 51:32.080
You know, you can either get into open source as a gateway into building things on your

51:32.080 --> 51:34.880
own so you can seek those things out.

51:34.880 --> 51:39.440
A lot of open source software, they have, you know, public get hubs, things like that.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.760
You can go search through their issue list.

51:41.760 --> 51:47.400
And a lot of times they have them tagged for like good first time issues or something like

51:47.400 --> 51:52.960
that that are great to just kind of introduce you into working on something, a project that

51:52.960 --> 51:55.160
other people work on.

51:55.160 --> 52:00.600
Or it can be a side effect of the first thing where you start building things that use open

52:00.600 --> 52:04.640
source and then you start finding bugs or you start finding missing features that you

52:04.640 --> 52:07.280
think they would, that it could use.

52:07.280 --> 52:11.240
And then you contribute to add those things, which is how I got into it.

52:11.240 --> 52:17.440
And either way, it's great because it not only gives you more experience to work on

52:17.440 --> 52:22.480
different technologies or even if the same technology, just different projects.

52:22.480 --> 52:24.360
But it helps you get involved with the community.

52:24.360 --> 52:27.640
You get to meet new people.

52:27.640 --> 52:32.820
It helps you learn how to contribute to a project where you're not the only contributor.

52:32.820 --> 52:37.380
So it kind of helps maybe teach you things about Git and how that works or just in general,

52:37.380 --> 52:40.200
like code reviews, things like that.

52:40.200 --> 52:46.880
Speaking of code reviews, it also means that other developers who are successfully maintaining

52:46.880 --> 52:52.120
a software are going to be reviewing your code, which just means that it gives you new

52:52.120 --> 52:55.360
perspectives on your code reviews.

52:55.360 --> 52:59.160
Don't take offense if they tell you you did something wrong or you should change it this

52:59.160 --> 53:00.360
way or that way.

53:00.360 --> 53:04.680
Just be open minded about that and understand that they are successfully maintaining the

53:04.680 --> 53:06.060
software.

53:06.060 --> 53:07.060
You're contributing to it.

53:07.060 --> 53:09.120
So use that as a learning experience.

53:09.120 --> 53:14.080
You can push back if you disagree, but just be civil about it.

53:14.080 --> 53:16.240
And then it also can get your name out there.

53:16.240 --> 53:24.040
I mean, I had a job offer simply because I was contributing to certain open source software.

53:24.040 --> 53:28.680
And when they found out I was leaving my job at the time, they reached out to me and they

53:28.680 --> 53:31.700
were like, hey, is it too late to offer you a job?

53:31.700 --> 53:34.320
So I mean, it can open up great opportunities.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.540
Plus, it looks good on a resume.

53:36.540 --> 53:41.100
You can always put that on a resume that you contributed to these open source software.

53:41.100 --> 53:47.340
And then it also just, I don't know, it's a different feeling to successfully have code

53:47.340 --> 53:52.280
that you wrote be merged into open source software that who knows how many other people

53:52.280 --> 53:54.280
use.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.280
It's super rewarding.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.280
It feels really cool.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
Yeah.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
Yeah.

53:58.280 --> 53:59.280
That's incredible advice.

53:59.280 --> 54:00.280
Thanks for sharing that.

54:00.280 --> 54:09.920
And that leads me to one of the most questions I have for you and it is, so you've built

54:09.920 --> 54:16.000
a SaaS product that you are very proud of and as you should be.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.760
What have you learned about product development in the process of building this project?

54:21.760 --> 54:22.840
Yeah.

54:22.840 --> 54:25.600
So the project is Status Tracker.

54:25.600 --> 54:27.960
It was my first SaaS product.

54:27.960 --> 54:33.960
It was my first time really delving into the indie hacking community and trying to build

54:33.960 --> 54:36.520
my own thing.

54:36.520 --> 54:41.600
So I mean, I've learned a lot from that project.

54:41.600 --> 54:45.560
One of the things I learned in that project was something I said earlier, which was the

54:45.560 --> 54:50.120
best tool or the best technology to use is a technology that you know well.

54:50.120 --> 54:55.280
I use this as an excuse to learn some new things, but kind of a combination of some

54:55.280 --> 54:57.960
new things, some things I was familiar with.

54:57.960 --> 55:01.640
So it meant that I didn't build it as well as I could have, but I did learn some new

55:01.640 --> 55:07.440
stuff and so I built it on Next.js and I used a boilerplate so it kind of came with some

55:07.440 --> 55:15.000
TypeScript baked in and some other stuff with GraphQL and a few other tools.

55:15.000 --> 55:22.280
So I was able to learn a few new things that I've since used on following projects, but

55:22.280 --> 55:31.280
it also kind of taught me personally, I am not great at the non-technical part of building

55:31.280 --> 55:34.240
and maintaining a product.

55:34.240 --> 55:41.680
I need the yin to my yang to be able to handle those non-technological, non-tech parts.

55:41.680 --> 55:49.780
I can try to do them poorly, but I don't enjoy them and I'm not great at them.

55:49.780 --> 55:57.960
So things like reaching out to the community and talking to potential users and just typical

55:57.960 --> 56:04.680
sales marketing type things, they're just not an area that I'm comfortable in.

56:04.680 --> 56:10.360
And I tried it and I kind of lost my interest, I kind of lost my interest in the project

56:10.360 --> 56:13.120
entirely while trying to do those things.

56:13.120 --> 56:16.880
So some people are able to jump in and do those things and some people aren't and you

56:16.880 --> 56:19.320
kind of have to figure that out for yourself.

56:19.320 --> 56:23.720
For me, I figured out that it's not the right fit for me and I need to find someone else

56:23.720 --> 56:25.720
to help me with that.

56:25.720 --> 56:28.000
Now some of that could though be the subject matter.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.320
With my cosplays, I feel a lot better doing those things because it's a community that

56:32.320 --> 56:33.440
I'm already involved in.

56:33.440 --> 56:40.680
I'm my own user, so it helps a lot and I am a cosplayer, I talk with other cosplayers,

56:40.680 --> 56:45.360
I enjoy that community and being involved with them, so it's a little different.

56:45.360 --> 56:49.080
So I think part of that too is if you're going to build something like this and maintain

56:49.080 --> 56:56.640
a product, maybe focus on something that the target audience is an audience that you want

56:56.640 --> 57:01.320
to be a part of, or that you are a part of, or that you enjoy working with.

57:01.320 --> 57:04.720
Something like that where you're not going to get burnt out dealing with them every day.

57:04.720 --> 57:10.680
Yeah, that's great advice, I 100% agree with all of that.

57:10.680 --> 57:16.640
Me building a company, it's turned into an agency and that's what I didn't want it to

57:16.640 --> 57:17.640
be.

57:17.640 --> 57:25.720
I have to 180 and I have to ask myself these tough questions about how did I get here and

57:25.720 --> 57:31.160
how do I walk it back to being the thing that I actually wanted it to be to start off with

57:31.160 --> 57:32.920
and also defining what those things are.

57:32.920 --> 57:36.040
I think the reason why it happened is I never defined them.

57:36.040 --> 57:41.840
I never wrote the company mission, if you want to put it that way and so if you don't

57:41.840 --> 57:47.960
have a north star, then it's easy to get off course without realizing it.

57:47.960 --> 57:52.680
If you don't have questions to ask yourself when somebody reaches out to you to do work,

57:52.680 --> 57:58.080
you don't have those questions like does this go towards the mission of the company?

57:58.080 --> 58:01.320
No, then don't take the work.

58:01.320 --> 58:07.760
And of course, circumstances can affect that, like if a pandemic hits and you suddenly find

58:07.760 --> 58:14.320
that oh boy, you might put the mission on the side for a little bit and say yes to things

58:14.320 --> 58:19.200
you wouldn't normally do but yeah, it's one of those things that happens.

58:19.200 --> 58:23.640
So in closing, I know you enjoy traveling.

58:23.640 --> 58:28.360
I used to love it when I used to be able to do that through one of the clients that I

58:28.360 --> 58:29.360
work with.

58:29.360 --> 58:30.360
Cool, yeah.

58:30.360 --> 58:35.640
As you mentioned, you've been doing less of that for the same reason everybody else has

58:35.640 --> 58:42.000
been doing this, but I'm curious, what has been some of the favorite places that you've

58:42.000 --> 58:45.040
visited and why those places?

58:45.040 --> 58:50.400
Yeah, yeah, that's a tough question.

58:50.400 --> 58:57.120
I'm not much of a favorite person, like I'm terrible at picking favorites.

58:57.120 --> 59:03.140
But I think, I guess I would probably have to say just France in general, but mostly

59:03.140 --> 59:07.640
that's because we lived there for the past four years, so we've been able to travel it

59:07.640 --> 59:11.800
and see more of it than we have really anything else.

59:11.800 --> 59:16.280
So I've been able to have a few kind of really cool memories of, we've taken a couple of

59:16.280 --> 59:22.560
road trips through France, the first time we, so we lived in Paris and we drove down

59:22.560 --> 59:29.200
through France, down south, went down to Nice, and then we kind of spent about a week driving

59:29.200 --> 59:34.280
along the Cote d'Azur or the French Riviera.

59:34.280 --> 59:39.920
And so we kind of drove our way west over to Montpellier and then kind of drove back

59:39.920 --> 59:41.400
up north to Paris again.

59:41.400 --> 59:45.680
So we kind of got to see quite a bit of the coast, but then also, you know, southern France

59:45.680 --> 59:47.040
and things like that.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.200
We got to see a lot of really cool stuff.

59:49.200 --> 59:53.100
We didn't spend a lot of time in any one location, but it was just being able to see as much

59:53.100 --> 59:55.440
of it as we could was really cool.

59:55.440 --> 01:00:01.680
And I think that was right after things started opening up after the pandemic, well, after

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:07.600
the pandemic, during the pandemic when things started opening up.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.800
And so we decided, well, we don't want to take a train, you know, we don't want to be

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.720
enclosed with other humans right now.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.000
So let's take a car, let's drive, be on our own.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.120
And so we got to do stuff like that.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.240
And then we got a little bit later, my parents came to visit.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.300
And so we took a road trip through the north of France and went through a lot of Normandy

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.680
and places like that.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.440
And so we've been able to see so much of France, it's just been really cool.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.500
But I look forward to being able to do that in other locations.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.920
Now that we're in Ireland, I'd like to do that more here.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.600
But also, there's still plenty more of the world in general that we would like to travel

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600
to more.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:48.720
And I think my number one place that we are wanting to go to that we were supposed to

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.040
have gone to during the pandemic was for our 10 year wedding anniversary, we were going

01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:00.800
to New Zealand, we were going to do the whole Hobbit trail thing, all that stuff.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.140
But of course, COVID ruined that.

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.800
So that's on our plans.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.880
We're hoping to get that rescheduled soon.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.720
But I think that's kind of my number one, like, I'm excited.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.320
I've been excited to go to New Zealand for years.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.320
So I really look forward to it.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.320
Yeah, sounds exciting.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:22.160
Yeah, I think that's also a place that I'd like to visit more so than Australia, to be

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.160
honest.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:26.000
I just have too many bugs.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I don't do good with bugs.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.760
And some of the freaky stuff that I've seen there, it just comes out of your shoes in

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.760
the morning.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.280
I'm just like, no, no.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.280
It is terrifying.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280
It is.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:42.880
I mean, I'm morbidly curious to go.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.200
We have some friends that we met in France who now live in Australia.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:49.760
So you know, they've offered to house us if we go visit.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:55.360
So we might do it one day, but I'm kind of the same, a little nervous, but still really

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.360
would like to go.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.360
Yeah, it's a beautiful country.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.360
I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:04.840
It's just there's a lot of creepy crawlies and I don't do good with those creepy crawlies.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.840
Sure.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.960
Well, Joel, thanks.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960
This is really, really good.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.240
I really enjoyed speaking with you.

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.760
It's really easy to talk to you.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.440
And I think we share a lot of the same interests, so that helps and the same viewpoints.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.440
Thanks so much.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.920
I hope you enjoy the rest of your Friday.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:23.280
I hope you have a lovely weekend and yeah.

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.280

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.280
Yeah, you too.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.280

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.280
