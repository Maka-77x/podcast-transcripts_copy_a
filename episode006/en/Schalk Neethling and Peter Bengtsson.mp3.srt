Welcome to the Mycelian Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,840
and the mentors and teachers that helped them along the way.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,640
Hey, welcome Peter.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,680
Welcome to the Mycelian Network Podcast.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,680
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,680
It's a pleasure.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,040
So, I've taught many approaches to doing this in the beginning.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,480
It's now my sixth recording.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,560
So I think what I'm going to try with this one is instead of me asking a bunch of questions

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,480
in the beginning, I'm going to kind of give you the floor and say that what I do know

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,040
is that you've been in the industry for a long time.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,880
You've done a whole bunch of things.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,480
We worked together for a long time as well.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,840
But what I think would be interesting is if you could just tell us your journey from when

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,160
you started getting into this or actually go as far back as you like, but kind of leading

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,880
us up to today.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,320
Yeah, so I don't know what you said about me in the introduction, but I've been doing

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,920
web development for 25 years and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,040
Some people have been doing it for 25 years.

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,400
They move on to become directors of dev rel something.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I don't know.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
I just love it.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,960
I started when basically I found out you can make an HTML page and you put them online.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,740
Me and my friends, when we were teenager, we made a webpage about poop and we uploaded

25
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:43,960
it to a website, like the telecom ISP's website.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:51,960
And this was back in the day when people would read magazines about the interlift and the

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,800
magazines would often have links to web pages that now suddenly exists and you can actually

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,160
go to and serve them.

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:07,000
And I had the smart idea of writing a angry letter to this magazine, complaining, pretending

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,080
to be someone else, pretending to be angry that this ISP have a webpage at this certain

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,160
URL that talks about poop, hoping that that would be some sort of controversial thing

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,400
that people say, what is this horrible thing?

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,760
I need to check it out.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,600
So maybe it did drive more traffic.

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,280
Maybe we had like three more people visit the site or something.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,600
I don't remember.

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, so I started making HTML and CSS, that kind of stuff back in before the millennia,

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,600
but in fact, when I lived in Sweden where I grew up and I actually managed to do a little

39
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,680
bit of work there, like consulting work and we're two companies that needed webpages and

40
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,760
I would do the webpage part of it and then hand it over to the Unix programmers who would

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,080
then add CGI to these pretty pages to make them into apps or websites.

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,040
And I kept doing that for a few years when I lived in England too, and those were the

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:19,760
days when you'd have designers who make something pretty in Photoshop and then hand them over

44
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:28,200
to web developers who would then slowly cut them up into webpages by extracting little

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,560
gifs, spacer gifs and things like that.

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,880
And then I took a little break from web development and went to school.

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,160
I did mathematics and throughout my summer breaks and winter breaks, I ended up working

48
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,320
for a little couple of guys at the university who made webpages and as soon as I graduated,

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,680
I joined them to become the first employee and together we started a consulting business

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,640
doing webpages and web apps and databases and yeah.

51
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,920
And then I did that for 10 years and then I moved to America to work with Mozilla doing

52
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,160
internal web properties where together with you Skulk as you know, that was all sorts

53
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,560
of internal and some external apps by heavy on webpage and then together with you again

54
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:30,080
Skulk the last couple of years and Mozilla I've worked on the MDN WebDogs page is usually

55
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:38,240
popular and I'm proud to say that I took a huge fart in rewriting that site from scratch

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:48,760
become a modern kind of a gen stack website and what could say and now I'm at GitHub where

57
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,280
I work on their documentation website maintaining that, that it functioned out and provided.

58
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,600
So that's quick whirlwind on my background.

59
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:06,520
I'm now based in the East Coast in South Carolina and so that's a little bit about my background.

60
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,940
I'm also and always have been a very early Python coder.

61
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:22,960
So I started back in 1999 and actually making some commercial Python book which was great

62
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,480
fun and it's kind of cool because I feel in a sense statistically I've been there from

63
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,920
the beginning and it's always fun to look back at that over the years and I swear I

64
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,260
have not seen anything as pretty as Python since I have been missing out the last couple

65
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:47,760
of years maybe there's been some recent development and Julia and Rust and so on and it always

66
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,000
been a big Python fanboy and I think what drew me into Python was another early interest

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,680
which I had when I started the web developer like people find a niche something that they

68
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,920
can attach themselves to.

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,660
Some people like aesthetics so they really like the idea of my pretty colors and having

70
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,460
something pleasant for them.

71
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:17,080
Some people come from types they like pretty fonts the right alignment like a newspaper

72
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,840
kind of that thing and they have many different interests and mine was that of usability like

73
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,840
a little nerd I would read everything I could get my hands on every blog post in the early

74
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,160
2000s but I would always I would always mop that concept of usability it felt like hey

75
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,320
that's something I can maybe become good at I seem to have an interest in it I like it

76
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,440
and it's something I like this burning sort of gut passion for fire for I really that's

77
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,120
something I can contribute with there are other people who really who just have different

78
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,660
passions and it's good like Ryan said and I think that's sort of was my love a little

79
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,120
bit with Python it felt like they made the programming language so you don't have to

80
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,360
think much like it didn't put a barriers it's almost like pave the path for you like a red

81
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,840
carpet and it's famously so that some people say that Python is written down English that

82
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,680
you can run because it reads so well and so that's always stuck with me I think over the

83
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,840
years maybe my interests have come and gone in different topics but the whole usability

84
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,240
piece the Jacob Nielsen research early on was super interesting and you can kind of

85
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:46,840
walk away with that keeping two simple axioms in mind and it says Steve Krupp he said don't

86
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,280
make me think and so there is so much more to that statement than just web interfaces

87
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,200
or UIs there's also don't make me think to your fellow code reader a fellow colleague

88
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,680
or even yourself so when you write a piece of code people often talk about the either

89
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,080
some other engineers can have to work on this code or it's also you yourself so write it

90
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:21,920
in a way that it can read as plain English make it almost too simple to be for what you

91
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,360
know put effort into making it super simple and I think that's a very very important ingredient

92
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,240
to multiple things and it's not just about how you make your UI and it's not just about

93
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,680
you type your programming code but there is a huge element of this in your system design

94
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:50,280
too like you need to always keep that in mind like if you hand this system over to someone

95
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:57,880
will they scratch their head and have to sort of worry about understanding why I don't think

96
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,920
people have a problem understanding oh this is Postgres oh this is memtest oh this is

97
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,800
PHP whatever they don't struggle with that but they might be wondering why is there a

98
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,000
extra Redis server sitting on the side and why does it have a cryptic name that I don't

99
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,280
understand and I think over the years I think it's become kind of my strain and some of

100
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:34,120
that might come from a bit of confidence that I don't feel like I need to show off because

101
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:41,400
if you don't need to show off you are less prone to take out the weirdnesses people sometimes

102
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,600
call out weirdnesses just to show off somehow it's strange I mean we're all a little bit

103
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,080
guilty of it we want to show to our friends that hey look I'm using this latest reactive

104
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:00,120
CSS framework something that you know that you don't use so I'm cool we all have that

105
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,160
in us there's no denying even people who call themselves masters of simplicity they sometimes

106
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,640
over complicate and kind of thrive a little bit in it I think we're all a little bit guilty

107
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,320
of it yeah that's really true you know I mean that way you said like even for yourself I think

108
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,240
where I learned a little bit about that and it's something that I'm starting to do again

109
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,560
is when I used to do music stall my guitar teacher told me always write the fingering

110
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,520
that you use for your left hand and your right hand write it on the sheet music because this

111
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:40,440
is not just important for now so that you can see and understand what you're doing but if you pick

112
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,000
up this piece of music again in five years from now you're going to thank yourself that you did

113
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,840
that because you're not going to remember oh in this part I decided to re-finger it like this

114
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:57,320
because it played easier or it sounded better or whatever the case is so I think leaving the same

115
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,160
kind of hints to yourself and therefore other developers in your code either by writing your

116
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,320
code in a clear and concise way that's easily understandable or when it's a little harder

117
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,640
because just it needs to be leaving comments to explain why it is the way it is so that if you

118
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,440
or somebody else picks it up then you're like oh I see that's why this is specifically like this and

119
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,680
it ties back to this thing and this other component that and that's the reason why this

120
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,840
is decoupled or that's the reason it's not decoupled I think it I think there is a

121
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:43,160
a lot of people say that mantra write a comment that explains why and that's almost easier too

122
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,960
easy to say and I have another perspective on that is when I used to study for my exams

123
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,480
one of the things I used to do was pretend to write cheat notes I even would write on a piece

124
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,240
of paper would write the text little with a sharp pen I would write the little formulas that I

125
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,960
had to memorize or the little important names or whatever it was I would write them in a small hold

126
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,440
just to make the whole exercise a little bit more special a little bit more mnemonic and I would

127
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,640
write them down the night before or the the days before whatever it was and then obviously leave

128
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,440
the cheat notes at home and so you don't get caught and the whole exercise there it's like

129
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,200
it's cognitive science it forces the brain to think about the things that you don't know

130
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,520
and it kind of goes like that with your code trail and your comment trail you don't

131
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:51,560
you don't necessarily need to explain everything the why but ask yourself like whoa this is a

132
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,840
little bit surprising I find it a little bit surprising I'm sure someone else is going to find

133
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:05,720
surprising so work from that don't look at every statement and think of a why comment for it but

134
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,440
look at it like hmm is this gonna be hard to understand for me would I need if this was my

135
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:21,320
old test would I need cheat notes to remember why this component is different from this or why have

136
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,280
I allowed to repeat some code or something there's got to be like a store and so deep there ask

137
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,880
yourself those questions I think that helps yeah yeah for sure I agree yeah that's super interesting

138
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,080
stuff I was thinking about something now but that slipped my mind so we'll cycle back to that oh

139
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:45,800
yeah no what it was is so you talked about usability and how that is like a burning passion for you and

140
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:52,120
I mean I've experienced that with some of the meetings we've had on while we were together

141
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,280
working on MDN where you've asked like really important questions during some of these

142
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,720
brainstorming meetings we had or where we talked about an interface that other people didn't ask

143
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:12,520
so like how do you is this just experience that that's leading to this or is there any like

144
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,920
material you can point out that you found that really helped you improve the way you think

145
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,600
about how to make good software right so there's there's two factors to that and that what

146
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:35,320
makes it almost impossible to explain but there's one factor is confidence like you need to feel

147
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,920
somewhat happy in your mind that you can take a punch in the face for looking like an idiot

148
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,160
because if you can't do that you don't want another instance of looking like a fool at work

149
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,760
and then maybe looking like a fool in your day-to-day life so confidence is one part

150
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,600
but the other part is something that stuck with me when I was a young young adult I did a lot of

151
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:09,480
martial arts and our instructor would insist like come on ask questions you'll only be an idiot once

152
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,320
that's the statement that I think about that too so you're in a work meeting

153
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:22,600
and as long as you're not completely wasting a bunch of people's time there's a great chance

154
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:31,400
that you can remove this idiocracy once and for all and then you've got to keep in mind too

155
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:38,840
that there's a big chance that everyone else is thinking the same so that maybe if you talk about

156
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:48,200
a tool if you find it a little bit nerve-wracking to kind of admit that you don't understand

157
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:55,080
you can at least boost your morale internally by thinking it's very possible that right now

158
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:02,760
I'm going to do a favor for her and him and him by asking this question and oh god forbid

159
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,360
I'm wasting his time and her time because they've already understood that so they were at the other

160
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,760
meeting but maybe if that helps to always think that you know what I'll take this one for the

161
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,880
team because it can multiply so I'll ask this hard question or almost embarrassing question

162
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:31,080
and so that those other people can also benefit so we can all benefit I think that's a tool that

163
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:39,640
can help and then you try to like do that with all sorts of other aspects um for example because

164
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:47,240
the truth is what we do as professional engineers working on computers is we write a lot of emails

165
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:55,800
slack comments you know relation tracker comments and stuff like that keep that in there too for

166
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:03,240
example if you see an acronym you don't understand or something you say what does p h p mean I've

167
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:12,840
never heard this before and you're doing that because a you google it but b now you might be

168
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:18,440
able to help the other people who are going to come and see this acronym and don't know what it

169
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,480
means now you're maybe saving that googling time for a bunch of other people so I think that's a

170
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:31,320
great little tool to justify that dip that you need to take by asking those questions because

171
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:40,440
it is a little dip so they can come out as a winner and I think um I think I so confidence I'm

172
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm I'm a moderately confident person I might not have great self-esteem I feel just as much

173
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:53,720
formal as everyone else in the world but another thing too that I think is very important and you

174
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,920
mentioned meetings is to kind of jump at the elephants in the world the hard questions

175
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:09,160
because I've learned almost too late that the academic way of the almost the best way of

176
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,680
learning is to like attack the really hard problems maybe you don't know the answers today

177
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:22,200
but if you jump to the to the last page of your math exercise book and work on those work you're

178
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,680
going to get stuck but your little brain is going to be chugging away at it maybe after the meeting

179
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,760
or the over the night or throughout the day so you're slowly like gather little fragments and

180
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,960
it's the same when you sit down in a corporate world and you're up against some sort of challenge

181
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,120
I think everyone in the room is kind of eager to to find a low-hanging fruit or something that they

182
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:55,800
can say hey uh I can do the uh the new signup button and then you feel sort of fulfillment like

183
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:02,280
hey I'm taking something away something that I can do but maybe what you should do is say

184
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:11,320
why are we building this or who's the user going to be for this or hang on why didn't we

185
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,480
install that other you know like really almost controversial questions and they can be asked in

186
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:24,040
a way that they don't annoy like like attack those because once you start chewing on those

187
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,040
whilst you may be working on that signup button rather than I'm just going to worry about the

188
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:36,600
signup button now this easy thing and then you're leaving procrastinating the big problems they're

189
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,520
going away they're just different ways or maybe rearranging them and some of them again maybe

190
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:49,400
they take a little bit of confidence to be them almost a little bit controversial by asking a

191
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,440
little bit weird questions but I think it really works especially if you mix it up a little bit so

192
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:03,240
you go some high and some some lows so you chat about like the big tickets that are almost there's

193
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,720
almost an energy in the room or a lack of energy where people don't talk about this

194
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,600
and then you mix that up with some of the easy stuff some of the low-hanging fruits

195
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,880
so that you feel a certain momentum going forward. I heard somebody say the other day

196
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,560
ignoring something doesn't make it go away doing it makes it done so I think that's

197
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:34,280
same for everyone to remember. Something that you've said a lot and that has an impact on me

198
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:43,000
personally is you tend to always say writing the code is the easy part understanding the problem

199
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,800
is the hard part do you want to dig into that a little bit? Yeah I remember there was a famous

200
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:57,240
blog post I forget the name of the author and he talked about planning the importance of planning

201
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:05,320
and the truth is that planning is awesome like thinking through the problem first

202
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:15,640
it really helps. The honest truth though just like buy low sell high it's not easy to plan

203
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,800
so sometimes what you need to do is you need to sort of immerse yourself with the challenge

204
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:29,880
jumping in and I don't know do whatever it takes to like get yourself disgusted by the

205
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,960
problem make it really really difficult and like get that all over yourself and in your brain so

206
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:43,000
it's all corners of your brain is working with this hard one and do whatever that takes like

207
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,520
some people like to jump into some crazy prototype some people like to write a document a google doc

208
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:57,000
a word doc where they're all pen and paper writing styles and like that can like jump into it because

209
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,120
once those things start to come out we start to sort of slowly develop a picture and then you're

210
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:14,840
and then you're like okay shoot we don't need that other database what we do need is the password

211
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:23,240
thing widget and now I've thought about it I've prototyped about it maybe that code has been

212
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,400
thrown away I have chatted to my friends and colleagues about it all right the work is done

213
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,200
now we just need to type it up so sit down with your JavaScript editor and write it down

214
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:43,560
and it's almost like taking notes or writing a reflective summary report and so I think

215
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:51,480
that ties into that topic that writing the code can be easy if you've thought about the hard parts

216
00:22:51,480 --> 00:23:00,360
of it and I don't that's not necessarily an answer but the statement I still stand by that often

217
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,480
writing the code is in there's also the certain element and we're all very very familiar with

218
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:14,040
that is that you're up against a big challenge and it's usually a very complex challenge in that it's

219
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:22,520
so much more than just the style sheet it's also getting approval from design and secure database

220
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,640
security folks and you need to have discussion with the product managers or something like that

221
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,840
those are and so there comes a time when you just need to put your headphones down and listen to

222
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:44,920
some music and just work on something so there is an element of sort of self-peace and happiness

223
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,360
that you take all those challenges which are so energetically draining because they can be

224
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,680
controversial and they force you so you kind of want to save yourself this afternoon I'm just

225
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:04,440
going to write the code I'm not going to get it right the first time but I'll listen to some music

226
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,040
and I'll type the code and and it gives you like a moment of meditation I think that's important

227
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:18,360
you need that and also the truth be told if you've been going through the challenges upfront so you

228
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,600
can sit down and relax your brain will still continue to work on those hard problems there

229
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:34,760
yeah very true so this podcast is a combination so it's a two sides of a coin it's one I speak to

230
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:42,120
people who are new to web development specifically or software engineering it tends to be that I've

231
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,320
mostly talked to like other web developers and these are people sometimes that young folks that

232
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:54,600
are literally like starting their career their life but sometimes it's also people that is

233
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:02,280
switching over from one career to becoming a web developer and so I think one of the things

234
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:10,280
I'm curious about is for people joining the industry now what do you think what advice

235
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:15,320
do you have for people like you talk about confidence and I think that's very important

236
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,720
but when you're new and you have this kind of imposter syndrome thing because you see a lot

237
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:29,480
of these like as they call them the programming ninjas then you kind of feel like I'll never be

238
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,560
able to meet up to those people what are what are some tips you can give people to like build up

239
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:41,480
their confidence and feel a bit more sure about themselves so that they have the confidence to

240
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:48,680
step into this world that's a great question and I think I have a very good answer I attribute

241
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:58,280
a lot of this to shared experience of being a mentor I've been a mentor for many young interns

242
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,720
who come like engineering interns but also maybe the most rewarding mentorship experience that

243
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:16,360
I've gone through was the outreach program which started in 2015 something like that maybe earlier

244
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:24,840
which was originally exclusively for women who wanted to gain to tech and non-asserted college

245
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:32,680
strategies so I was mentoring there and I learned a lot I think there's a huge difference between that

246
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:39,720
mentoring path compared to young interns especially as you know Skulk a lot of interns we've come

247
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:48,120
across they are from the top universities in the U.S. and France and Canada and the kind of a reason

248
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,880
why they from the top universities and that's because they're freaking clever cookies who got

249
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,000
into those universities they're the go-getters so they there's a different type of mentoring for

250
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:10,520
them whereas the more shall we say adult mentees it's 99% of our confidence 1% I'll name it let's

251
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:22,280
say 90% confidence 9% direction and sort of that and maybe 1% a little bit of coding or some

252
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:31,800
engineering and I think I can conclude this is like my opinion but maybe one of the best things

253
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:41,480
you can do is to have a very good mix of professionalism and weaknesses particularly

254
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:50,600
showing weaknesses there is almost nothing better to give someone a massive boost of confidence

255
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:59,000
when they can see I'm putting up quotation marks when they can see that someone who's professional

256
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,520
and good at something fails and that you show that and you talk about them and try to be a little

257
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:18,120
bit more than just this one time I accidentally leaked the password but you know drive on this

258
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:27,400
point a little bit show that look I am good at A B and C but I am terrible at D I don't understand

259
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:33,400
it it's so frustrating I get tired I can't believe it I feel like tearing in my hair sometimes and

260
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,760
you know that kind of stuff and also maybe mix in some of those little failure stories that

261
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:48,440
we all have and they don't always have to be about oh I took down production sir and you dig the

262
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:57,240
there are many other failure stores and I often sometimes say stores like I wanted to sit down

263
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:05,640
and learn this new programming language and I just couldn't it didn't work for me my brain

264
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,240
couldn't kick in like I couldn't get it like nothing is more motivating for someone learning

265
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:23,880
and new in tech so and the other two tips that I have are more guidance and I think your role as a

266
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:35,880
mentor is to not teach anything but to maybe help the person find their passions their strengths and

267
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:44,840
like what their heart and their gut goes and and be there for that you know you like tease it out

268
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,640
like hey you seem hmm I get you starting to maybe see you seem like the kind of person you are

269
00:29:51,640 --> 00:30:00,120
maybe see you seem like the kind of person who thrives in speaking to a crowd hmm maybe that

270
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:06,600
could be your thing you could do talks oh and something like that or or hey you seem like the

271
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,840
kind of person who likes to I don't know get all the ducks lined up like an organizer someone who

272
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:22,200
likes to finish all the bunk tickets and there's one last hugely powerful tip for people who are

273
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,880
new in the industry and I think in all fairness in terms of wanting to become a better engineer

274
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:35,800
there is nothing better than making stuff and I think what we all need to do is we need to cool it

275
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:43,800
with our side projects it's so easy to say for a mentor to a mentee or junior person yeah build

276
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:52,200
more side projects but it's not that simple people have lives they have passions they have

277
00:30:52,200 --> 00:31:00,120
personalities but here's the thing may can be many different things if you come across someone

278
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:07,640
who might not be that kind of a side project kind of a gal or guy maybe you can say hey do you know

279
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,120
what you should maybe do write the blog post and they say oh I'm not very good and then you insist

280
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,600
on that like yeah I know it's a hard in the beginning but you know get started you can maybe

281
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,120
write a blog post that shows it just to me and maybe we can edit that if that's your passion

282
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,800
you know like you have to try to find something that they can make because reading will never get

283
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:43,240
make someone good I mean it will help but making is the true north for everyone that they need to

284
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,600
to do to upgrade their skill set but here's the thing you've got to help them understand what mate

285
00:31:50,600 --> 00:32:01,320
means I've come across mentees who seem to they seem to have a knack for live audience speaking

286
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:08,200
and they thrive there and so my job as a mentor is to kind of say look there's a conference

287
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:16,200
this one here's the url maybe you propose a presentation for that and I know it's a small

288
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,480
one and we have to travel and I know you're not an expert of this topic but hey let's figure

289
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:29,480
something out maybe you can come up with a slightly adjacent topic there they can yeah those are my

290
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:38,600
my three tips on mentoring or show your own weaknesses and help someone guide them towards

291
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:46,200
where their heart wants to go and then trigger will force them almost to make things whatever

292
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:56,360
that means coding and writing presenting so yeah I think it's huge and I think it's an important

293
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,920
thing to to highlight the whole thing about being willing to show your weakness because I think the

294
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,960
world has gotten to that point where people have been actually kind of told the opposite thing

295
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,560
they've always been told to hide your weaknesses and only show the wins don't show the failures

296
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:18,600
only show the wins until you are some super famous person and then you can talk about your failures

297
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,840
but while you're still coming up hide them hide them and I don't think that that that is a good

298
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,760
approach because you know the first time you fail you're going to feel so alone in that failure

299
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,680
you're going to feel so alone in that failure because you have nobody else that is said me too

300
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:45,240
I also find it hard I think that is why I still come across people constantly who don't know how

301
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:52,040
to use get or even get hub and they're too afraid to say that so that they'd rather just not

302
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:58,040
contribute to a project they'd not contribute to open source because they're too ashamed to say

303
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:04,120
you know what I can solve this problem but I'm not sure how to use get and get hub to get my

304
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:11,480
solution to this project but it feels so silly for me to not know that so I'm just going to not do it

305
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:20,760
yeah it's horribly true it is very much so and now that's the perspective of the particularly

306
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,000
where you started the conversation was like more of junior person and and that is a harsh reality

307
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,680
and that they had to contend with it's easy for a mentor to say show your weaknesses we're talking

308
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:39,640
about the mentors weakness and but it is and it is a very very difficult thing to be up against

309
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:47,160
especially when these start to add up like there you have the junior person who realizes oh I still

310
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,840
don't understand get and I don't know how to use it actually that's just one of them you know I'm

311
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:59,400
also struggling to understand flexbox and I'm also struggling to understand compilation I don't

312
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,320
understand what the difference is between a binary and a plain text or something you know they could

313
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:12,120
be many of them and but there's not a lot you can do about that we can't know everything and

314
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:19,160
we can't know everything and this is not necessarily about showing your weaknesses so you need different

315
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:26,040
mechanisms when you're in that situation when there's too many things and I've always thought

316
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:33,240
that if I was in I mean it's easy to say no that I'm more experienced but the only really thing you

317
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:41,400
can do when you're up against that is to try to clear the table so that you can focus on one

318
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:50,120
little thing at a time and nothing these may be breaking it down into absolute constituents because

319
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:58,200
you know this and you've come across junior engineers too who honestly they don't necessarily

320
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:05,160
understand everything and neither do you skull for me but what they do is they go to like the top of

321
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:12,200
the framework and try to use it and then they get stuck because they don't really understand

322
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:19,080
the fundamentals and we've all seen shall we say stack overflow posts where they copy and paste

323
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:26,120
all of their code and it's full of full of their like their business logic and stuff and they're

324
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:33,240
saying it doesn't work and that kind of stuff and the only way that they can get out of that rut

325
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:40,520
is to break it down a little scale away and I think the truth be told too here's the thing

326
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,600
there is only one way to solve that and that is to peel it down and that absolutely differentiator

327
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,600
of an experienced engineer and a junior engineer is that the experienced engineer goes there

328
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:02,920
himself he like oh I don't understand how github desktop works support what they do is they

329
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,160
peel away okay all right let me go back to get the command line tool or I still don't get it

330
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,880
all right maybe they peel away a little bit further they go down to absolute basic commands

331
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,640
then maybe they open up the files or maybe they seek out some documentation about they like the

332
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:26,920
core of it and they start whereas maybe a junior engineer they don't naturally go to the lower

333
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,360
levels the lower layers themselves they're maybe throwing their hands and so maybe that's it's

334
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:41,960
something to keep in mind that hey you're a junior the probably the reason why you get stuck is

335
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:49,720
because you don't naturally go deeper to break it down into add a molecules and then you break down

336
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,960
the molecules into atoms because that is what the seniors do they they don't know it either

337
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,200
but that's what they do and I mean there's a reason why hello world is popular it's because

338
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,960
and that's how the brain can learn you start with something like that print hello world and

339
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,280
we'll work our way up I mean it's easy to sit here and say all of this because there's another

340
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:24,520
element too that if you're in a junior position and you want to level up it's not particularly

341
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:32,680
fun to go down to assembly language and learn what a bite is and what you want to do is you

342
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:39,400
probably want to ship something there are a few things that is rewarding is that you want to like

343
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,360
make something to show your mom and you want to like you want to just download this framework

344
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,760
and put some cool stuff together make a web page or an app for something like that that is what

345
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:59,800
you want to do right and I don't think there's anything that can be done to solve that other

346
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:10,040
than maybe try to do both like you start with an objective you say I want to make a whole iOS app

347
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:18,440
and you come at it a little bit some like the basic tutorials on there but then you're like

348
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,600
all right now I'm starting to get stuck here I need to figure out how do I do a form loop in

349
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:34,040
potlin wait that's android but anyway that you you can like come at it from the top like the

350
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,400
application and then you can take little breaks and go to the very very smaller components and

351
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,160
just tinker away and I don't know how many times I've done this in the past but it's been an

352
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,920
absolute godsend you're up against a big challenge big system big framework something like that

353
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:59,080
and it's so confusing there's so many compilers and transformers and transpilers and everything

354
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,600
it's like it's all big blur but you know you've got to ship by next credit and but there's few

355
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:14,520
things that are as powerful as learning as to like open a new window maybe go down like download the

356
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:24,920
raw babel like just down or if it's next.js you create a fresh new next.js installation

357
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,560
and you just have this one little thing that you want to do and you can do it maybe your temp

358
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:36,840
directory or a new computer but you're like just test it out like ah now I understand how lazy

359
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:42,200
loading css will and like that and then you're like scrap that away kind of like your cheat

360
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:50,440
notes and then you can go back to the to the beast and to work but that has helped me so many times

361
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,280
and the only thing stopping me from doing it again and again is just sort of human in persia

362
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:04,040
and laziness but you know that it's what you need to do here is you need to sort of maybe

363
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,720
start a fresh new install of maybe create a brand new database or what a table or something like

364
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:18,760
that just so you can understand there's one tiny little thing and then jump back at all it's funny

365
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,040
that you mentioned that um the other day on the i listened to shop talk show and they were speaking

366
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,680
to some folks in the agency and they do a lot of wordpress stuff and even though they do a lot of

367
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,440
wordpress it's not really their strong suit so oftentimes what they would do is when they will

368
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:41,240
want to build a new like component they open up a code pin and like build a component inside code pin

369
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,600
then take that and stick it in into wordpress because now they know they have a version of it

370
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:54,680
that works so if anything breaks it's something to do with wordpress so now you need to just figure

371
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:00,200
out what is it in this new environment that's clashing with what i'm trying to do because i

372
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,120
know if i take it out of this situation i put it by itself it works and i bring it into the scenario

373
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,560
it doesn't work so what is different about these two environments and then start teasing it apart

374
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,240
until you find oh it's because it has this extension that does this weird thing and i did

375
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:23,080
happen to use the same id and it's it's grabbing my element and doing funny stuff with it for sure

376
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:33,480
i love those tools code pen code sandbox yeah also um when you and i sculpt worked we did a lot of

377
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:43,480
a lot of complex stuff with the aws system and i got a lot of learning from i used like my private

378
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,240
accounts for that and if there was something i didn't understand i want to create a brand new one

379
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:58,280
just to test something and then throw it away and so there are lots of tools and they're all

380
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,400
they're really good to have they're good to have and to not be intimidated i think it's an amazing

381
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:09,720
thing that's happening in the last couple of years now especially in web development where

382
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:19,000
you file a bug and so saying it doesn't work they say hey can you copy and paste it into a

383
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,360
code sandbox and give us the url and you put it in there and eve what's so amazing too is you

384
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,280
don't necessarily have a perfect story to tell there in your bug that you're going to file or

385
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:39,400
the rubber duck debugging is simply breaking it down for the sake of maybe putting it into code

386
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,240
pen can help you understand what the hell is wrong so for people who don't know what a rubber duck

387
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:52,360
debugging means it's uh it's this idea that you are struggling you're stuck something doesn't work

388
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:58,520
and you ask your colleague over a friend hey can you help me debug what the hell is going on

389
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:05,240
and so your friend comes over and stand over your shoulder or on zoom as we do these days

390
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,880
that you say all right so i took this fall i tried to copy this i tried to compile this function i

391
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,440
tried to write this style as well i said what the hell no i see what i've done there's my mistake

392
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,880
and you say to your friend like never mind i figured it out as i was breaking it up i figured

393
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,960
it out you can go back to your desk so your friend was just standing there like a rubber duck not

394
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:39,400
doing anything and so it's quite a famous sort of strategy or anecdotal strategy and hey use that

395
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,200
to your advantage you don't need to disturb a colleague every time what you can sometimes do

396
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:52,200
is i don't know what's going on i'm going to start a a tiny little atom in say the typescript

397
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:59,080
playground just the tiniest little function a little type definition and almost as if you prepare

398
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:06,120
yourself to post the stack of posts or something or show that code pen to your colleagues and

399
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,920
there's big chance that that will inspire your brain to understand it maybe or that you spot

400
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:21,320
your little mistake on a type or whatever it might be yeah and i think then this ties back to

401
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:27,880
something you said way back um then writing about this whole thought process you went through

402
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:34,040
because this can help somebody else again and this ties into your blog which especially when

403
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,920
i search for stuff related to python or something like that more often than not i will land on your

404
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,760
blog and find the answer there so i think blogging is extremely important it's something i've been

405
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,160
neglecting but i'm trying to pick up again but you you do a really good job of running a very

406
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:57,400
active very there's just so much useful information in that blog what is your approach to to that like

407
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:07,160
any tips for people want to start blogging i i my approach i mean i wish i could um and i'm jealous

408
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,200
of the people who can pick up a new topic they have observed it and then they almost rewrite it

409
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:20,600
again in their own words and for example they're the people who keep an eye on say the tc39 spec

410
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:27,240
discussion so something as it goes through and then they uh they're able to just rewrite it one

411
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,640
more time in a different set of words uh maybe uh less technical and a little bit more of a story

412
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:40,040
and that's great readership and maybe the truth maybe they do it to get traffic or maybe they're

413
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:48,360
just as human as anybody else in that maybe if i write it all over again in my words i'll understand

414
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:56,600
and uh someone else said that if you write an opinion you'll get a lot of negative feedback

415
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:05,640
but if you write an experience you can never be real and now it's almost maybe a better quality

416
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:11,480
product uh article if it is an opinion and because it can stir the mind a little bit but hey we're

417
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:19,400
all the humans so go a little bit for writing your experience and my approach is um a kind of

418
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:27,640
imagining almost in my head that there was a stack hold for question and let me uh then explain

419
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:35,800
an answer so you write like all right this is the problem i encountered and it was not easy

420
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,880
eventually i found i can use this function and by the way this function you can read more about on

421
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,560
this page and here's an example of doing it with unicode characters and that's what i did and then

422
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:56,280
i found that so you write a little bit uh an executive summary about what you just went

423
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,160
through what you learned there like one tiny little micro step that you took in it but you

424
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:07,560
maybe spruce up the words so that it can be consumable consumable by someone else in my google

425
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:17,880
across it and i tell you um so my blog is just a loud note taking from my perspective that's what it is and it's

426
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:25,560
the stack overflow answers that no one asked or something but it is so rewarding uh when someone

427
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:35,400
posts a column saying hey that really helped me and uh i would encourage everyone to go for that

428
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,480
because in a world where we count likes and hearts and sort of increments like that

429
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:48,520
there is nothing as rewarding as that feeling of having touched someone's actual progress

430
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:56,120
so if you can turn around and look at it from that perspective like what can i do to make

431
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,480
someone's life a little bit easier like to make them move on it is so much more rewarding than

432
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:09,560
getting 20 likes on something keep that in mind that you might touch someone's life by lining

433
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:18,200
down these loops and it probably doesn't take that long but it's it's hard and everyone struggles

434
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:25,400
with it because we're all guilty of once this thing your challenge got solved you kind of want

435
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,960
to move on with your life oh that was a stressful thing to figure that out and and i kind of felt

436
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,400
guilty the way i solved it because i i did trial and error i didn't read the spec or something so

437
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:44,760
it felt sort of like i wouldn't move on but that dirty experience behind me i try in the last while

438
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,440
because like i said look because i want to get back into blogging again well i have been but um

439
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:57,720
i try and keep like a notion thing open and then when i hit a problem and i start unraveling it

440
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:03,960
i start just putting little notes in the document like as i go through the process just like maybe

441
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,640
a screenshot of something maybe just a line that kind of can trigger a memory for me later on

442
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,600
and then i work through the problem i solve it and i move on but then maybe over the weekend or

443
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:20,440
something i'd go back to those notes and i try and flesh them out into an article that explains

444
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:25,880
properly like this is the issue i hit and these are the steps that i went through so i've got

445
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,200
the basics there and i've got any screenshots that might be helpful in demonstrating how i

446
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,840
went through this little bash outputs like this is what you should probably see in bash after

447
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:40,920
running this command so i put all of that in and then i run it up sometimes if it's something that

448
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:48,360
i can do again i'd literally like do it again and this time take the time to actually write down

449
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:53,320
each and every little step but you don't you don't have that time always so that's why sometimes i

450
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,880
just throw stuff into a notepad thing if you want to call um just i have a reference to go back to

451
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,240
later and say okay let me break this down into an actual readable thing because at this point nobody

452
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:11,080
understands what the exist yeah i often wonder and so you touched on another interesting excuse

453
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:17,720
and that is have time and it is an honest uh thing like you it's hard to have time

454
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:24,600
um i often wonder so that's one excuse the other excuse was the thing i touched on was that when

455
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:30,840
you did go through this experience was it a bit dirty like did you actually not read the manual

456
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:38,920
like you should have and which one is the biggest blocker for you taking the time to write down is

457
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:46,680
it that you don't have time or that you're a little bit guilty feeling for your journey and

458
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:54,040
so it's i think it's worth keeping that sometimes it's a bit of both or sometimes it's one sometimes

459
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:59,160
it's the other yeah i guess it also plays into that weakness thing if you had to admit that

460
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:04,280
that honestly if i just read the docs i probably would have fixed this in a much shorter time but

461
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,920
i was too lazy and you kind of don't want to admit that and then if you look back at it you might

462
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,040
say to yourself that was a stupid thing to do if i just read the docs i could have saved myself

463
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,960
20 minutes now i've gone through a yucky experience and i'm too embarrassed to write about it it's

464
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:25,800
just double uh double there's another element too which is very very important and so one of

465
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:31,480
the reasons why we blog is to become a more professional and better engineer than build

466
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:38,040
better stuff build better more successful businesses so if that is the goal does it matter

467
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,760
if you get punched in the face a little bit here and there i have many a times blogged about

468
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:50,280
something only to find someone posts a comment where they say hang on did you know that there's

469
00:52:50,280 --> 00:53:00,280
this library or why didn't you just divide by six oh shoot like whoa and now you're confronted

470
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:07,320
with an almost embarrassing blog post plus comment that kind of makes you look a fool but hey

471
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,960
they wouldn't have mentioned that library in your comment they wouldn't have if you hadn't written

472
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:20,680
it you would have been completely oblivious about that amazing other thing that is available

473
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:29,960
and okay maybe you could stumble upon it further all right but you didn't so it was thanks to you

474
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:37,320
showing your weakness that you stumbled on a new strength now you're like equipped with something

475
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:44,360
you didn't have before this is amazing library and the internet's too big to spot everything

476
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:51,400
they give you this and now you can copy and paste that or take that and you can put it back into

477
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:58,040
your work and you can succeed even better you can now make a better web app that you would have

478
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:05,160
otherwise you will earn more dollars thanks to this because had they not mentioned it

479
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:11,400
that no had you not shown what you did they mentioned a comment that makes you look a fool

480
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:18,600
a little bit you will put more food on the table and that's kind of worth it and things tend to be

481
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:26,600
forgotten but successes tend to kind of they can live on longer so that is another motivator i think

482
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,880
now for sure and there's there's the other side of it that also happens which kind of happened to me

483
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:38,040
the other day that's not exactly the same thing but it's it's it's similar in nature so i recorded

484
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:45,160
a little uh video of using this library that automatically generates all your pwa assets i

485
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:50,440
think it's even called pwa generator or something like that um so i made a little video of how it

486
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,600
does that and why it's really cool and helpful and saves you a bunch of time and i stuck it on

487
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,600
youtube and the first comment i got was from a person who said you shouldn't use web technologies

488
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,560
to write mobile apps you should just write mobile apps and then i like replied to them i said you

489
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:11,160
know fair point but the thing is sometimes we don't all have massive teams of developers that

490
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,600
have experience in writing ios apps writing android apps and then this web team sometimes all you have

491
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:21,320
is a little web team or all you have is yourself and you know web technologies and this is a way

492
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:29,400
for you to be able to write your write an app for ios or for android or both using your existing

493
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:37,000
skills and so the person didn't come back and then about two weeks later the author of the package

494
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,840
pwa generator came on to mine and said oh thanks so much for your insightful answer and thank you

495
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,880
so much for writing recording this video about my package i really appreciate it and i was like

496
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:56,600
ah awesome so yes i got a little pushback i i like i told the person that you know thank

497
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:02,920
you for your opinion here's why i'm saying this and then i kind of got validation from the author

498
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:09,240
saying yeah that person was online so these things are also going to happen but it shouldn't stop you

499
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,720
from putting the thing out there because people have different opinions and you're going to have

500
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:19,320
people indeed we're just going to like say there's a little bit of yin and yang to everything yeah of

501
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:27,480
course i also think um a lot of people they might look a fool when they're dancing on the dance floor

502
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:35,240
they go to the i don't know a club or whatever and they do look a fool and it's embarrassing

503
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:40,520
to dance but that's how they met their husband or their wife had they not gone to look a fool they

504
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:47,240
wouldn't have met that person and had a wonderful life together so keep that in mind too sometimes

505
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:53,480
you got a dance uh and it's gonna hurt and then someone's gonna snicker but just wait there's

506
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:00,120
some gems yeah that's very good uh yeah this has been an awesome chat i only have one thing as a

507
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:05,320
closing out and i think your comment just now kind of ties into that very nicely which is what do you

508
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:18,840
do when you are not coding or mentoring or working um i'm an avid swimmer and i swim almost every

509
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:25,080
morning early i wake up at five o'clock and i know that sounds like annoying to some people who are

510
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:30,440
not morning people and i'm sorry about that but that's the nature of that sport it's something

511
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,720
you do early in the morning and and i take a lot of fulfillment out of that because it's one of

512
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:43,880
those things that you can do for your health that isn't too disruptive to family lives and and it's

513
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:51,000
you don't bang into things like you do with other sport or rip your knees out in certain sports

514
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:00,840
and then you can't really fall down like you can with a bicycle that's my other thing i think i

515
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:06,920
think i would have answered side projects as my hobby when i'm not coding but it's too boring of

516
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:14,760
an answer but it is true it is i mean honest to goodness i look around and i have friends you know

517
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:23,000
you know they do uh woodwork or they do um they're playing the piano or something like that and

518
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:30,360
i'm jealous almost like hey look they have a hobby um or what i do with my free time oh i code

519
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:38,840
side projects but um yeah yeah i remember um forgot his name now same as entrepreneur

520
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:46,040
uh started linkedin and many other things um and listen to podcast like he does so many things and

521
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:51,240
they ask how can you be in so many things all at the same time it's easy i don't have any hobbies

522
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:59,080
and they're like shit man if he can say something like that maybe it's not such an embarrassing fact

523
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:07,480
to say that i sit in my vs code editor on a sunday they've messed up the end of the world

524
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:16,600
at all no i don't think so i think as long as you get true god-honest joy out of it then there's

525
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:23,720
nothing wrong with it yeah and the other truth is that uh why do you swim and are you like smiling

526
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:30,200
as you're taking your strokes no uh there might be um i don't know there are some exercise moments

527
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:38,120
where you're actually smiling uh but the truth that we do it for is it's honestly to live a

528
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:44,120
healthier life over it's like an investment right that's what we love smiling whilst we're doing your

529
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:50,680
peloton bikes and so why are you working so hard on these side projects are you like sitting there

530
00:59:50,680 --> 01:00:01,160
on a sunday afternoon smiling away having fun like no you're almost me you're grinding away so that

531
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:08,280
you can have a more sort of a happier years ahead of you because if you're working away on those

532
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:15,320
side projects and you might not earn many dollars on it through much fame but hey now you actually

533
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:21,240
understand this new css framework you didn't do that before and it can put little smiles thousands

534
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,240
of little smiles on on your face they barely even move your lips like i actually feel like i

535
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:33,880
understand this little piece and it's thanks to what i did last last last last sunday and so that's

536
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:40,360
happiness because we all like to make things and we all like to look good doing what we do for a

537
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:49,480
living so that's another thing like keep that in mind especially i mentioned earlier that you're

538
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:56,680
going to make tomorrow keep that in mind that it might not be all like happiness and fun and stuff

539
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:03,800
you might be frustrated in your free time and and it's hard work and there might not be a big amazing

540
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:14,600
uh financial success but there will be like spread thin butter on a massive piece of bread like you

541
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:19,800
won't get a little bit happier trying a little bit every day by the sheer fact that you know

542
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:28,280
something a little bit better is it's rewarding thanks for that i think is a good place to to end

543
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:35,080
it thanks again for joining me and uh yeah it was really awesome and thank you so much colt
