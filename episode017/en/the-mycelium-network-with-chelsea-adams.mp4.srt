Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,520
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,520
Hey, Chelsea.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,720
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Yeah.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
Thank you for having me.

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,720
Thanks so much for joining.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,400
I really appreciate it.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,160
So you were one of the many people that reached out over polywork when I did my initial, like,

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,040
are people interested in this kind of thing?

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,920
And I'm still blinded by how many people were interested.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,880
So you were one of the folks, and then I started doing it, and I got so caught up in the whole

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,840
process and all the other things that I do.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,800
But then eventually, I was able to get back to you, and we were able to set this up.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,000
So I'm so glad that we were able to do this.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,880
I think this is going to be a really interesting conversation.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,400
I've done some research about you and found some really interesting things that I'd like

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
to dig into.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,920
So I'm looking forward to the conversation.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Yeah.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Yeah.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Yeah.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Thanks for reaching out.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
I've been having fun making some connections on polywork, and I saw that.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,680
And I was just very interested in your project and what you're doing.

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,560
So that's kind of what prompted me to respond.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,520
It sounded like you were doing some really interesting work yourself.

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,520
Oh, that's good to hear.

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
Glad to be here.

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Yeah.

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,040
So I normally ask people to write a little bio in the document, but that's more for me

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,600
to use when I post it.

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,720
In the beginning, I read it out, but I thought, oh, it's so been done, I want to do it differently.

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,800
So what I decided to do is I'm going to let you tell your story instead of me giving a

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
summary of your life story.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,520
So take as long as you want, go as far back as you'd like, bring us up to the current

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
day.

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Yeah.

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,680
So just in general, I'm a software engineer and creator, I guess, generally speaking.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,800
I do a whole bunch of different work in my day to day, but I got my start really when

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
I was a kid.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,160
My dad started a software company when he was just out of college, so I grew up with

43
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,120
computers and the internet and being around all that stuff and developed an interest in

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,000
it pretty early in my life.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,560
And so I went to college for, well, the degree was in liberal arts.

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,160
It's a background in philosophy and mathematics and science and music, everything.

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,240
It was a pretty interesting program, unique as far as I could tell at the time.

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,560
I was at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland.

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,360
So that's where I got my undergraduate degree.

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,680
I went on to get a master's in philosophy and education from Teachers College at Columbia

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,880
University, and you can see that none of this has anything to do with technology yet.

52
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,440
So that's my formal background.

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,800
Yeah, that's my formal educational background.

54
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,980
And then I'm mostly self-taught with everything that I've done over the years with the tech

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,680
side of things.

56
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
But I did grow up around it.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,520
It's been ever present in my life.

58
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,620
So I've had a lot of exposure to tech and just lots of tinkering over the years.

59
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,800
And so I started out, I kind of wandered around a little bit after grad school and I hadn't

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,600
really found a way yet, but I just started teaching myself how to build websites.

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,280
And I went from there and now I do all kinds of things, write software and still make websites.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,720
And I run a podcast and I just do a little bit of whatever I can do.

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,400
I like to craft my own career around whatever keeps me learning the most.

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,880
So I'm likely to get bored if I'm working on something for a really long time and not

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
changing it up.

66
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,160
So that's kind of how I've built my professional life so far.

67
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, I can totally, I know what you're saying.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Me too.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,600
I need different things, otherwise it just gets, and I want to keep learning.

70
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,600
That's the big thing.

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,000
And I'm naturally curious.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,640
And so I was in the corporate world for a while and it just didn't fit at all.

73
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,760
I was so frustrated and it was so meaningless that I just felt like, no, no, no, this is

74
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
not it.

75
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
This is not it for me.

76
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,720
So yeah, the whole polywork philosophy really clicked with me, especially when I heard the

77
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,960
founder express what it means, because at first I was just like, oh, it's another shining

78
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
little social network.

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,680
Let me go see what it's about.

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,280
And then when he explained it, I was like, oh, right.

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,720
That is exactly what I was looking for.

82
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
So it's great.

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Yeah.

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,800
So I've spoken to a couple of early stage folks so far on the podcast and also just

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,360
in general, I have some folks around me and I've mentored some people in the past.

86
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,280
And the one thing that's, I don't think it's something I could really go away ever, but

87
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,720
I do understand tech has become, I don't know what the right words are, but it's become

88
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,760
this profession that is almost a little bit elitist in a way.

89
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
I think we want to change it.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,080
I think we acknowledge there's a problem there and it shouldn't be like everybody's welcome

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,880
and anybody can do this, you know, if you put your mind to it.

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,840
But maybe it's the nature of the work, maybe it is the environment you work in.

93
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm not sure exactly what is leading to this, but the one thing that I've heard from everybody

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,840
is even more so than finding like good education material or finding good mentors or anything

95
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,360
like that, the one thing that they find is imposter syndrome hitting them from day one

96
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
almost.

97
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,640
And sometimes, yeah, and sometimes just feeling like they're not sure if they made the right

98
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,480
choice, like especially people that are changing careers.

99
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,640
And I was looking at your blog and you recently posted one called Coming Home.

100
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:04,120
And in that, you mentioned the sense of unbelonging amongst peers and leaders and how it relates

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,600
to how we measure ourselves.

102
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,000
And so I'd like for you to dig into that a little bit if you don't mind.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,880
Yeah, I went to my 10-year college reunion, which is always weird.

105
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,240
I think college reunions are just going to be weird no matter what because it's just

106
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
awkward.

107
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,440
You don't remember people, blah, blah, blah.

108
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,160
But it was a really good time.

109
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,320
It was really neat to see everyone and hear about everybody's professional progress and

110
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,800
meet their kids and all of these things.

111
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,960
But I went with my partner and we were talking about it afterwards and she was like, everyone

112
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:44,520
who was sitting around in that circle talking, almost everyone at least, it seemed like everyone

113
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:52,640
had taken these almost taken years to kind of meander around and end up, they almost

114
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,400
kind of had this delay, this like six or so year delay post-college where they were wandering

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,760
trying to figure out what it is they really wanted to do with themselves.

116
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,880
And some people are still wandering, so that's fair too.

117
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,360
It takes longer sometimes.

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,160
But there's this delay in kind of kicking in with what many of us probably would consider

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,480
real professional progress that she observed from that group that I thought was very interesting.

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,600
And I think imposter syndrome probably, I mean, in my case, it definitely does have something

121
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,240
to do with it and probably did with these peers too.

122
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,680
But the idea that I was thinking about was just sort of like, well, everything that everyone's

123
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,160
saying here, we're all comparing ourselves to an ideal, to that person that we idolize,

124
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
to whomever it may be.

125
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,760
We're comparing ourselves to a standard that we don't think we've reached yet.

126
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,640
That's kind of natural to do.

127
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,600
But when you do that, you don't often remember to look on the other side of the spectrum

128
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,560
of your own progress because it's impolite to do so usually.

129
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,620
You don't want to be like, oh, I'm better than that person.

130
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,600
So you don't usually allow yourself to do that kind of reflective thinking.

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,060
It's just like a bad habit.

132
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,320
It's considered impolite, whatever it might be.

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,000
So it's not something that we are prompted to do very often.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We're not prompted to look either at others or even just measure against our own progress

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,560
and look back and say, wow, I'm much better than that.

136
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:24,520
I have at least the skills to know that I have moved from point A to point B along my

137
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,740
journey of progress.

138
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,880
So even just having a moment to self-reflect can be useful sometimes and we often don't

139
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,800
make that time for ourselves in our professional lives.

140
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,280
But yeah, that was the thought with that post, it was just like I definitely have struggled

141
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:46,680
with unbelonging and imposter syndrome, but I have, I guess I would say I've recently

142
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:54,240
started to become more comfortable just knowing what I used to not be able to do and can do

143
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
now.

144
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah, so that kind of was the reason for that post was that social occasion where that feeling

145
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,760
seemed to be felt by people my age and people with whom I graduated and things like that.

146
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Do you think, it's interesting to say that you've recently started to be able to deal

148
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
with it better.

149
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,600
Do you think this is something that comes with experience or age or is it a combination

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
of it?

151
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,640
Because for me, I think, I'm still ice and struggle with it heavily, but I am better.

152
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,160
If I'm honest with myself, I am doing better with it.

153
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,720
And I do think age for me plays a role in that.

154
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,720
I'm at a point now where I feel like I don't have to prove myself so much anymore.

155
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,920
I don't have that need so much anymore.

156
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,040
Yeah, I think it must have something to do with it.

157
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,560
I think you can't really get that reflective quality until you've done some things that

158
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,880
you can reflect on, so you're really not going to have that backward looking experience.

159
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:14,000
But yeah, I think it's just important to give yourself time to establish that you care about

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,200
something professionally, first of all, because before you do that, you don't have a standard

161
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,640
against which to measure your own, I don't know, your own chunk of your career, whatever

162
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,480
it is, in the general world, the general professional world, until you've had a little bit of time

163
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,840
to establish yourself, learn what you like and don't like, until you've had some time

164
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,040
to try and fail a couple of times.

165
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,440
It's hard to form that perspective.

166
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,400
But I think that it's possible to work on it, certainly, if you're a little impatient

167
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,800
without waiting.

168
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,280
There are things you can do, like even polywork you mentioned has been good for me to address

169
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,080
some of these things.

170
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,560
I think finding accountability to put yourself out there a little more aggressively than

171
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,760
you might be comfortable with doing, so having professional peers publish that blog post

172
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,160
before you're really ready and have them review it, things like that.

173
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,120
Stop getting in your own way a little bit is the way I would describe it.

174
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,280
It's just like, okay, I'm holding on to this so tightly because I want to be a perfectionist

175
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,960
about it, but do I really need to be in the way of this right now because I'm the one

176
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,480
who has to push the publish button.

177
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,280
I can worry about it being perfect all day long, but I still haven't pushed the publish

178
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
button.

179
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,760
That for me was what was getting in my way.

180
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,360
I was my own worst enemy there.

181
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,920
Yeah, I think that's common.

182
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,720
I know my daughter, for example, she's got in between a couple of ideas of what she wants

183
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:55,120
to do, but I know that she has a real passion for writing.

184
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,520
I think her work is really good, and I've told her that, but I don't think she believes

185
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
it.

186
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,680
I think it's because there's this fear, and I'd like to ask you this because it leads

187
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,880
into this second topic that I've had in the dark.

188
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,480
I think social media plays a big role here, right?

189
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:24,960
It's created this idea of perfection that does not really exist.

190
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:36,000
People are so scared of being wrong, and I don't understand when that switch flipped

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,200
over and we went to this thing where it's such a bad thing to sometimes be wrong, where

192
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:52,320
it's such a terrible thing to sometimes fail, and where people always want to show or pinpoint

193
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,720
the things that you didn't do well, instead of just celebrating the humanity of that and

194
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,760
celebrating, having an idea and putting it out there.

195
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:13,740
I ran into this with a... I found a guy on LinkedIn that made a little glove that has

196
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,120
these sensors on it, and so if he moves it around, it can turn silent and get into audio,

197
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,840
but he's also put NFT chips on each finger.

198
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,800
If you program it, then if they get near to an object, like a blind person, it can tell

199
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,600
them what the object is, and I thought, that is so cool.

200
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,760
That is such a great idea, and I shared it in one of the Slack servers that I used to

201
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,600
be on, and wow, did people poo over that, all over that.

202
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,080
They did not say, this is a great idea, but it has some flaws.

203
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,000
It was just all out, this is like, oh, not that terrible idea, and I was like, I'm leaving

204
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
because this is super toxic, I don't want to be in a place where you criticize ideas,

205
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
because I think ideas is what's going to move us forward as humanity, and if you're going

206
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,720
to start just killing people's initiative, then I don't know where we're going.

207
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,520
I rambled a little bit there, but I'd like your...

208
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,840
No, no, not at all.

209
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,840
I think that social media definitely plays a role.

210
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:23,640
I also think it's much easier to respond with negative criticism than it is to offer suggestions

211
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:32,760
for how to improve things, especially in online communities where anonymity doesn't kick in

212
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,440
and say that it's not that little voice in the back, you don't have that little voice

213
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,080
in the back of your head that says, hey, maybe think before you say this out loud, because

214
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,320
you're not looking at the person's eyes, you're not going to insult them to their face.

215
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,280
Those kinds of things that happen in face-to-face interactions with people, and we've had even

216
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,960
less of that since COVID, so I think the problems have gotten more intense, but those are the

217
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:01,240
sorts of things that allow us to pause and take a breath and maybe just not sling that

218
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,960
mean comment or criticism or whatever.

219
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,400
All of that's absent on social media, so unless you're very, very good at self-moderating,

220
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:14,200
which hardly any of us are, it's just so easy to just pop in and be like, well, I don't

221
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,040
like that, I don't like the colors, I don't like the whatever it may be.

222
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:24,920
I see a lot of design stuff on Twitter, and any time any redesign of anything is released,

223
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:31,320
it's just a huge thread of thousands and thousands of, I like the old one better, or just whatever

224
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,720
the criticism may be.

225
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,840
It's just because it's so easy.

226
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:40,160
It's much more difficult to confront a problem and say, hey, this is a good start.

227
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,800
I think I would maybe think about improving it in this direction.

228
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,720
It requires you to think and do some work in order to engage that way, so many of us

229
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,000
not having the time usually just choose the pithy little criticism.

230
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,480
But I was going to say earlier too, I think that writers would probably have this problem

231
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,280
more than others, being isolated from a professional network, which I also do find myself feeling

232
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,360
that I am, just because I've worked up to this point, I've now actually started an LLC,

233
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,080
but up to this point I was just working as a freelancer, so like a contract, I didn't

234
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,000
have a company, I was just operating as me.

235
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,760
But I think when you run a consultancy like that, it doesn't give you a whole lot of opportunities

236
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,120
to just sit down with peers and hear whether or not the work you're doing is any good.

237
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,160
You hope that the client's happy with the project at the end of the day, but there's

238
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,720
not a lot of quarterly review with your manager to tell you how you're doing kind of stuff

239
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,120
as a freelancer or a solopreneur or whatever it may be.

240
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,240
While that most of the time doesn't bother me, when I think about how I'm doing professionally

241
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,920
and how I want to improve professionally, I have to go seek out feedback from non-traditional

242
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,760
sources in order to get it, and it's very hard to do that, and it's especially hard

243
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,900
to do that and go find the positive feedback that would help you manage that imposter syndrome.

244
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:17,240
So I would imagine, I think writers would be particularly challenged by that for the

245
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
same reasons.

246
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,120
It's like your work product everybody can read and they can like it or not like it,

247
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,880
but how do you appeal to the professionals who could help shape your career?

248
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,120
How do you reach out to people who can give you a positive, valuable feedback like when

249
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,120
you need it, when you're most drained or most in need of some help?

250
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Yeah.

251
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Yeah.

252
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,000
I think that's a very, very good point, and I'm going through that, and I think I found

253
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,040
some things that's helping, but there's still a gap there, and so I think this is something

254
00:17:52,040 --> 00:18:00,440
that beginners also struggle with is finding mentors that build them up and won't break

255
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,720
the spirit.

256
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,800
So that's why I'm really careful about managing the MySQL network, the Discord server aspect

257
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,880
of it really, really closely.

258
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,800
Like daily, I open it a couple of times a day to just make sure conversations that happen

259
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,840
or it goes in a positive direction, and even, I'm not saying you always have to agree,

260
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,240
like disagreeing is good.

261
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,680
It's how you learn.

262
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,680
It's how you learn to sometimes look at something from a different perspective, and sometimes

263
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,760
you find out that maybe you were wrong or not even necessarily wrong, but there's a

264
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,840
different perspective, and you can agree to disagree.

265
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
That's good.

266
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,760
The thing is when those conversations become toxic and when there's somebody that has a...

267
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,720
You can see that they always have something negative to say.

268
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,520
Like they never have something positive.

269
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,520
It's like, no, no, no.

270
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,040
Yeah.

271
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,040
I think that in tech especially this can be difficult because at least from my own personal

272
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,680
experience there's a lot of what I would probably call neurodivergence in tech, and what that

273
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:12,560
can mean is that there are a lot of different ways of expressing ideas and difficult problems

274
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,160
and concepts and arguments even or discussions.

275
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:24,440
There are just different individuals that don't mix well together in certain kinds of

276
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,040
conversations even just because of some of those factors that you're never going to be

277
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,600
able to account for all of those things.

278
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
It's very difficult to manage.

279
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:37,440
That's what I found, but then there are also some things that borderline into...

280
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
This is with tech generally.

281
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:45,080
There's some borderline behaviors that have been allowed to flourish in certain tech circles.

282
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,280
We see this with big companies with culture problems usually don't hear talk about it

283
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,880
until it becomes like a Activision Blizzard or an Uber or whatever it is.

284
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,280
You don't hear about this stuff until it bubbles up to the surface, but there is a lot of kind

285
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:09,160
of just not exactly even bad behavior sometimes, but just not supportive encouraging professional

286
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,820
behavior that happens in these places that is just allowed to happen.

287
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,800
People just start to assume that that's the norm for behavior, so it can be really hard

288
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,960
to foster communities where people are respectful in a way that you're talking about.

289
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,040
I really appreciate that you're doing work focused on that because it's a real tough

290
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
problem.

291
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
No, it is.

292
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
It is.

293
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,000
It's early days, so I think I'm still in the honeymoon phase if you want to call it that.

294
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,400
I hope to be able to drag it out as long as possible, but I'm in a privileged position

295
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,480
in that respect that I do have access to other people that's been in the community space

296
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:55,600
for quite some time that I can ask for advice because I want to prepare myself for not the

297
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
inevitability.

298
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,640
I don't want to be negative about it or pessimistic about it, but should something happen, I want

299
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,040
to be prepared in how to handle it.

300
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:14,760
I don't want to have to figure it out as it's happening because oftentimes... Oh, there's

301
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
you.

302
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
Sorry.

303
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
No worries.

304
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Was I not muted?

305
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
No, you were.

306
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,760
I hope I'm muted.

307
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Okay, good.

308
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
I hope I'm muted myself.

309
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Anyway, sorry.

310
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Go ahead.

311
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
No, no.

312
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
You did.

313
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,000
Because I think often in the moment, you might react in ways that's going to make it worse

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,640
rather than better if you're not prepared because it might be heated and so you might

315
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,440
fall into the trap and instead of bringing the temperature down, you might just add fuel

316
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,000
to the fire.

317
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,040
Yeah.

318
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,240
I'm bad at this even my way of communicating when I'm in the middle of working, I can only

319
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,360
do one thing at a time.

320
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,760
I only have a single thread in my processor, just the one, but I can only work on one thing

321
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
at a time.

322
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,160
So we live our lives on these messaging-based apps.

323
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,080
So I live on Slack and Discord and Teams and whatever combination of all of those things

324
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,560
I need on my desktop at any given time, but I'm always on, always connected and when I'm

325
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,840
trying to work on something, somebody pops up with a DM and I'm usually blocking because

326
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,280
I'm the one who has all the keys to the AWS and all of that stuff in my organizations

327
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
usually.

328
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,380
So if I'm the one blocking, I have to stop what I'm doing to go work on something, which

329
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,040
means that I have to rip myself out of my context and plug into another one and so my

330
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,960
style of conversation can be very like, here's what you need, goodbye.

331
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,880
Sometimes people do not respond and I'm not mean, but even just, I was just thinking about

332
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
that the other day.

333
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
I'm like, I should probably be a little more intentional about taking a second to think

334
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,680
before I just shoot off whatever message, even if it only needs to be this brief little

335
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,280
informational thing.

336
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,080
I should probably at least just think before I just start typing.

337
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,240
Just think before you start typing is a good principle.

338
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,040
I mean, it's probably a good way to behave on social media too, but yeah, I just go into

339
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,280
this automatic got to get it done mode and sometimes that busyness I think even can contribute

340
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,120
to a tone that can be unapproachable for some people or some styles of workers or thinkers

341
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,680
or whatever it may be.

342
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,160
No, that's for sure.

343
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:32,400
I think doing many things and working from home, there's so many interruptions that naturally

344
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,560
happen throughout the day and I think those can compound without you even noticing it

345
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,440
and somebody might just DM you at the wrong moment when you've been interrupted multiple

346
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,760
times already and then you're just like, ah.

347
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,400
Now you're just in a bad mood, but it has nothing to do with what that person asked

348
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
you.

349
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Yes.

350
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,880
Yeah, I try to manage distractions in a couple of different ways.

351
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,440
I bought this Pomodoro timer.

352
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,680
I did a huge, I kind of took a moment this summer to professionalize and kind of redo

353
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,760
my setup and that's when I formed a company too instead of just working as a freelancer.

354
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,240
So I started doing all of this stuff, but one of the things that I did was try to manage

355
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,600
my time better and so that required a couple of things and one of them was this timer that

356
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,840
makes me work for 25 minutes and take a five minute break and I get a lot more done now

357
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:32,440
and the other thing was using a cal, I use cal.com as a calendar integration software

358
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:39,680
so that I have too many calendars on too many projects and I need them all in one place

359
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,760
and my phone is one of those places, but I can't share my phone with people so I had

360
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,640
to make it so that people could schedule things because I was just spending so much time in

361
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,360
my day scheduling things and I'm like, I need to either pay a virtual assistant which I

362
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,160
can't really afford yet or I need to have some sort of calendaring solution.

363
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,920
So that's been another really important thing of the working from home time management part

364
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
of my life.

365
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Okay.

366
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,200
Those couple of little tools have made a good big bit of difference, so yeah.

367
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Yeah, for sure.

368
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:15,280
I recently also created like a calendar that's a feed of all my other calendars just so that

369
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,760
the calendar counters.

370
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,400
Because the thing is I ended up, not too regularly thankfully, but it was getting a little bit

371
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,240
out of hand where I would double book myself because I would look at the wrong calendars

372
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,520
and I would forget, oh, dang, that other client also had a thing, oh, now I have to go back

373
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,920
and say, can we do it an hour earlier or an hour later?

374
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,160
And so I was like, no, no, no, let's go and keep it going on.

375
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,520
And also my days were all over the place because I wasn't always sure what the heck I was doing

376
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,240
so I was like, have a calendar that's a view into all the things, because then at least

377
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,080
I can look at that and say, okay, here I have two hours with nothing and I'm going to make

378
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,440
sure I keep those two hours of nothing, because I think that's the other thing.

379
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,200
That's actually been the most, yeah, that's been the most beneficial part, I totally agree

380
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
with you.

381
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,520
It's the having access to your own time that comes with having that view, that macro view

382
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
of all the calendars.

383
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,880
You have access to your own time in a way that you don't have without it.

384
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,480
So you can be more efficient even in that way, because you know that you've got unscheduled

385
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
time.

386
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Yeah.

387
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,040
That's also been very important.

388
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Yeah.

389
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Yeah.

390
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,880
And I can imagine for people changing careers, like going from being, let's say, a lawyer

391
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,080
to being a coder, I think for them those types of time management things are critical too,

392
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,000
because you have this day job that you can't just now quit.

393
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,280
You have to take your time and make sure you're ready before you and you have to get that

394
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,680
job in tech that can support your lifestyle that you've already had.

395
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:50,520
So I think for them, time management is also like, I'm sure, very tricky.

396
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,680
So hopefully some of this information will help them as well.

397
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Yeah.

398
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:06,640
Circling back to the social media aspect, I started off being very indie and being very

399
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,640
like running my own blog, all these kinds of things, and I don't know when, but at some

400
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,000
point, I don't know if I just got lazy or what was the story, but I neglected all that

401
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,160
stuff and at some point it hit me.

402
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:29,160
I was like, my goodness, if these social things go away, a lot of my thinking and thoughts

403
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,920
and stuff that I've written and videos I've made is going to all be gone.

404
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:42,000
And I then just stepped back and said, wait, wait, wait, wait, how did this happen?

405
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,280
I still don't know, but that's okay.

406
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:52,440
At least I'm now pivoting back heavily towards the indie webcam camp, because that's what

407
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
I love.

408
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,560
I love that aspect of making your own things, owning your content, having a domain where

409
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,640
your stuff lives and you have control over that.

410
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,200
So I am doing more and more and more of that, but I saw what you've done, like I think that

411
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,960
I haven't even thought about doing, and you have created an archive of your Twitter account

412
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
on your website.

413
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Yeah.

414
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,520
I wrote a post about how to do it.

415
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,640
I need to do the follow-up because I need to talk about the publish once and just syndicate

416
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,760
everywhere part of that equation.

417
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:38,600
I got really into Leventy, which is an indie web favorite, I think, static site generator.

418
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
It's a really cool tool.

419
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,440
So I got into that because I needed to move my personal blog off of Jekyll.

420
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:50,680
It was on Jekyll, and development stopped for that, and I just needed a new tool.

421
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,160
When I got into that, I was like, well, this is pretty cool how all of this works.

422
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,600
It just generates the whole website based on a couple of JSON files, is pretty much

423
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
what it does.

424
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
So it's really cool.

425
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,160
So if you feed it the appropriate data, you can do anything.

426
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,560
So if you can access your own Twitter feed, pull out the tweets from it, you can just

427
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,080
dump them in an archive, and that archive does go up to the point of that publishing

428
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,880
of that post.

429
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,440
I need to pick up with the project and keep going, but yeah, recently, I took a similar

430
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
path to you.

431
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:30,280
I kind of left to go explore all the shiny social apps, and don't get me wrong, I spend

432
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,480
plenty of time on social media.

433
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
I love TikTok.

434
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,880
I learned so much from TikTok.

435
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,120
There's so many interesting people on it.

436
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm a big Twitter person, and I think being a writer and a tech person, that's just kind

437
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
of natural.

438
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,720
I spend a lot of time on social media, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about

439
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,640
how bad social media is.

440
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,960
And I'm also spending a lot of time thinking about actually if maybe professionally I want

441
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,240
to start to work on some of this problem.

442
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:08,320
It's more from a content creation perspective, because I'm really worried, I'm really primarily

443
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,720
concerned with your content, you owning your content, you being able to make money from

444
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,560
your content however you want to, I'm interested in all of this.

445
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,680
So yeah, anyway, I did create a Twitter account, I'm very interested in the Indie Web.

446
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:30,920
I'm interested in how the current generation of people creating things on the web could

447
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:37,120
potentially migrate off of these platforms where they get locked in, and onto a syndicated

448
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,080
content model.

449
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,960
So I'm actually doing some work along those lines, and we'll see if it ever materializes

450
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
and becomes anything.

451
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:51,400
But yeah, I'm thinking about it a lot, because I'm a little tired of being beholden to tech

452
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,600
behemoths that come and go and behave badly in the interim.

453
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:03,640
And I have to work, you know, like my day job, what I'm considering my day job, one

454
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,600
of my big contract projects, I have to interface with meta on a regular basis.

455
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:15,480
And it's just the most soul sucking, thankless, like it's just impossible to actually even

456
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,920
talk to a human at meta, which is frustrating from a developer experience perspective.

457
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,760
But anyway, so there are a whole lot of reasons why not to lock yourself into any social platform,

458
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,040
any content platform, and I'm a big fan of finding ways to do that.

459
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,960
And then helping just the everyday consumer find ways to do that, which I think is the

460
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,440
big missing link right now, just average Joe Schmoe who doesn't know how to deploy a website,

461
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,600
how do we get those people ownership of their domains, you know, so.

462
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
For sure.

463
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:55,560
Yeah, it's incredible to me when I sometimes speak to folks that's been even to some of

464
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,680
the bootcamps that's around these days.

465
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:05,360
And sure, they've learned quite a couple of things, but then they're like, I don't know

466
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
how to get this online.

467
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
How do you get it online?

468
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,440
And I'm like, wow, they didn't teach you that?

469
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,320
That's like so core to the thing.

470
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
What does it help?

471
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,840
You can make all these things, but you can't share it with the world, like, do you just

472
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
always have to...

473
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
There's actually a huge...

474
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

475
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
No, no, no.

476
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,200
I think it was mostly that.

477
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,160
It's just like, I think it's such a big part of it when you're learning is to make your

478
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,760
own thing, not put it on somebody else's thing.

479
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,560
Yeah, so yeah, go for it.

480
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,960
No, I've noticed, I think there's a big opportunity for documentation in general to do a much

481
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,520
better job here because I spend a significant chunk of my time in any given week reading

482
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:51,680
developer documentation and almost none of it that I've come across tells you how to

483
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,920
harden a project and deploy for production.

484
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,400
It's just like, here's how you get started.

485
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,040
Good luck.

486
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,640
Nothing tells you how to be ready to have actual users using your thing and in fact,

487
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:09,000
a lot of them do things that are not best practices for production deployments in their

488
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,320
tutorials because they expect you to understand that it's not for production, but sometimes

489
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,200
when you're learning, you don't expect that.

490
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,960
So yeah, as a self-taught developer, I found that to be pretty frustrating, but it is a

491
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
pattern there.

492
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,560
I mean, not having attended a boot camp myself, I can't speak to the quality of them, but

493
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,360
I do know that from some people who have graduated from them, that they have been less useful

494
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,920
than they would have hoped for that reason, that you just don't learn.

495
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,120
You learn a lot of the fundamental, the starting points, but you don't learn how to actually

496
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,720
execute on a vision, which is what everybody wants to do when they go to a coding boot

497
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
camp.

498
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
Yeah.

499
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
Yeah.

500
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Not for sure.

501
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,520
But you mentioned earlier that you are the co-host of a podcast called 16 to 1 with co-host

502
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Katie Day.

503
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,160
Do you want to tell us a little bit more about your podcast?

504
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
Sure.

505
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Yeah.

506
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,200
So having mentioned my background in education, you can probably imagine how I ended up here,

507
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,360
but I just am obsessed with podcasts.

508
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
I love the medium.

509
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
I think it's interesting.

510
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,920
I've heard some of the most fascinating stories of my life through podcasts, and I have a

511
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,440
couple of favorites, and so I listen pretty regularly to those.

512
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,960
And so for a long time, I'd been like, I really should try this.

513
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
I love to talk.

514
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
I love to think.

515
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,560
I love to, you know, whatever, learn new things.

516
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
That was the main thing.

517
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,440
I want to be able to do something that makes me learn something new every, however often.

518
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,320
And I'd been talking about it with my partner for a while, and I was just like, we got to

519
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
do this.

520
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
We got to do this.

521
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,320
And then we chose to do it right at the beginning of a global pandemic, which was an interesting

522
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,000
choice on our part, let me tell you.

523
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,920
But yeah, about a little more than, I guess, like two and a half years ago now, it's been

524
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,040
a while.

525
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,240
We started recording episodes, and we post every other week.

526
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,160
And it's about education, teaching, and learning.

527
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,760
My partner is a teacher, public school teacher.

528
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,200
And again, like I have an interest in a background in education, although I'm not a classroom

529
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
teacher.

530
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,120
But yeah, we talk about education every other week, and I've been doing so for years, and

531
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,120
we have a great time.

532
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,080
And it's a lot of fun.

533
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,040
It's really just something fun to work on together, more than anything.

534
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,200
But yeah, that's what we do.

535
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,760
Yeah, listening to one of the episodes last night is really cool.

536
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
I really enjoyed the style of it.

537
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
It's very conversational.

538
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Yeah, I really enjoyed it.

539
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm always curious.

540
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
Yeah, we try to have fun with it.

541
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
Yeah, for sure.

542
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
It comes through.

543
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Yeah, you're hitting it on the head, the nail on the head.

544
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:52,560
I'm always curious also about in the actual education, well, I mean, actual, but teaching

545
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
at a school.

546
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,320
I'm always curious about the experience of that because it has changed so much.

547
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,040
In some ways, it hasn't changed at all.

548
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,840
In some ways, it's changed a lot.

549
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:09,240
And I always wonder what is the experience like for teachers now in the school environment

550
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,120
from multiple perspectives, you know, like just working with kids nowadays, like kids,

551
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,880
the way kids react and the kids behave have changed.

552
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:26,960
Like our, even us as adults, our ability to pay attention has shrunk considerably.

553
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,360
And I think with Jane Z, is it?

554
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,120
I think that's what the almost latest folks are.

555
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
I honestly can't keep track of them all.

556
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
I can't either.

557
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:42,840
I was with my daughter the other day, like, what are you, what are your young friends,

558
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
what is my sister-in-law?

559
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,760
And I'm trying to figure that out again, but yeah, like, you know, what it's like to work

560
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:57,600
in that environment where you, you're fighting like these super interactive and super, I

561
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,200
don't know what, I can't remember the words now, but, you know, you're just fighting a

562
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,360
technology that is built to keep your attention and you as a teacher have to somehow get their

563
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,840
attention in the same way.

564
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,160
I think it must be a massive challenge and I'm, you know, I'm really thankful for people

565
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,960
who do that because yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm trying to do that from a developer perspective,

566
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,280
but, you know, for the most part, the people that you interact with there are people that

567
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,560
are self-selected to learn this thing.

568
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,480
Like the tricky thing in schools are oftentimes the kids aren't necessarily interested in

569
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,280
what you want to teach them and that then that's the first hurdle that you have to overcome

570
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,760
is to take a subject and make it interesting.

571
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,320
And I always, I don't always know if teachers are given the tools they need to do that.

572
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
And so...

573
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,360
Yeah, that's a good question.

574
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,680
We're actually about to record our next episode we're going to do it this afternoon and it's

575
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
going to be on inquiry based learning.

576
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,400
So it's about creating the conditions in which students can become interested and take ownership

577
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,240
over what they are learning.

578
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,960
So that's something that we worry about in our classrooms.

579
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,000
But yeah, I too am in awe of teachers, I say a majority of my friends are teachers for

580
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
whatever reason.

581
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,120
I'm just around them all the time.

582
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,360
They're everywhere in my life.

583
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,520
And what I hear most often is that, yes, that there are attention issues with technology

584
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,320
and for sure, and discipline issues.

585
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:37,640
I think the biggest thing though is what makes it difficult is actually the parents of students.

586
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,680
That's what makes it really, really hard to be a teacher is that if you could just go

587
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,240
to your classroom every day and not deal with parents and just teach the kids, then it's

588
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
great.

589
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,720
But there's so much managing of bad parent behavior and expectations and complaining

590
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,640
and all kinds of just like helicopter parenting.

591
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,200
But it goes in different ways absent, you know, absent parents, all kinds of you just

592
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,560
you're overcoming so much at that point.

593
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,440
You're working to overcome so many factors that honestly have nothing to do with school.

594
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,240
They're about these people's lives.

595
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:18,280
So we expect our teachers to do the work of, you know, five, 10 professionals all in one

596
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,440
because we expect them to be psychologists, we expect them to be disciplinarians, we expect

597
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,040
them, you know, some kids come to school and that's the only meal they get during the day.

598
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,380
So like that's the kind of those are the kinds of conditions under which we're working.

599
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,880
So it's not only all the all the stuff that we're normally worried about, you know, following

600
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,880
behind peer nations or whatever it might be about our educational system, which we definitely

601
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
are doing.

602
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:50,480
But but I think what we really need to kind of do is I really think that there's an under

603
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,420
an under commitment of resources to education, you know, formal education in this in this

604
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,520
country at least.

605
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,780
But I think we have a lot of work to do to prioritize education because it's the one

606
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:08,400
thing that is able to open up doors for people, you know, and I think we should be putting

607
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,520
more money into the educational system and putting more more time into making sure that

608
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,840
it works for all kinds of different learners.

609
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
Yeah, for sure.

610
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:22,560
As somebody from a third world country, I can say it's not just the United States, it's

611
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,280
prevalent everywhere.

612
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,120
We have other problems, compounding, compounding the problem, but it's interesting the parent

613
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
aspect of it.

614
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,960
It's unfortunate that that is such a big problem, because that's a hard one to solve.

615
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,480
It's very, very hard one to solve.

616
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,720
How do you think like you kind of touched on it earlier when you talked about you read

617
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,840
a lot of developer documentation, like, it doesn't always have the things that you would

618
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,440
expect that you have.

619
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,360
What do you generally think about like education models and stuff like that when it comes to

620
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,920
the tech industry?

621
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:06,200
Is there anything that you find that's been done really well and then the opposite?

622
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,320
That's a good question.

623
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,160
I haven't come to tech through such a strange circuitous route.

624
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:19,840
I probably wasn't exposed to a lot of what would be considered this kind of thing in

625
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:27,320
the tech industry, so I probably can't speak to it with a great degree of certainty.

626
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:34,200
But I think that the times when I've personally, professionally benefited most have been times

627
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:44,360
when I've gotten to learn from peers who are patient and helpful and interested in answering

628
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
questions.

629
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,320
Even just making yourself available to answer questions can make a difference in somebody's

630
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,720
professional life if you're in a mentorship position.

631
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:02,800
So I think we have a lot better opportunity for mentorship in tech.

632
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:10,440
I'm so self-directed as a learner that I've always wanted to know all of this stuff.

633
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,240
So I've never had a problem with motivation like what we were talking about before.

634
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,320
I've always been curious.

635
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,720
So I've never had to be the sort of person who had to slog through something because

636
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,560
I'm choosing to slog through everything I choose.

637
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,480
So yeah, I don't know.

638
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,200
That's a good question.

639
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,720
It's such a broad thing.

640
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,740
I think that higher education in terms of tech, so like formal computer science programs,

641
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:44,520
I think what I know of higher education is that they lag behind industry in such a way

642
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,160
that the real, I think that the real reason that they exist is to pair you into a professional

643
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
network.

644
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,480
I think that's why higher education is, unless you're going to do research or something really

645
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
difficult.

646
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,960
I briefly considered going to do a natural language processing program because I was

647
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,000
really super into machine learning and stuff like that.

648
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Then I was like, you know what?

649
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,520
I don't want to sit, I don't want to do a research.

650
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,080
I don't want to be in academia.

651
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,760
I want to make things and do things.

652
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:29,100
I think, yeah, anyway, I think it can be hard to find a way in if you're not going to go

653
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,680
one of the accepted routes.

654
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,000
Technology is one route, getting a computer science degree and going directly into a startup

655
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,520
is another route or an established tech company.

656
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,560
But if you're not going to do that, it's very difficult to discern a path.

657
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:55,200
Then I also think that the big tech companies probably don't do enough to invite a variety

658
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,520
of different learners from a variety of different backgrounds into the fold of technology.

659
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,920
That means that not only are there formal educational problems, but there are also problems

660
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,400
of, hey, do I identify with anyone in this group?

661
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,280
Am I going to be a total outsider here, either socially or economically or whatever nationally,

662
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,680
whatever it is?

663
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,600
A lot of these problems are social and cultural problems more than education or employment

664
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,600
problems, I think.

665
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,600
Yeah, that's really true.

666
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,160
I want to cycle back to that in a second.

667
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,240
What I do think there is a real need for is some kind of mentorship network.

668
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:42,520
Honestly, I've been in the industry for quite some time, but I do new stuff all the time.

669
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,600
I'm not always sure am I doing this the best way that I could possibly do it.

670
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:55,880
I recently did a project where I worked with MongoDB, but then I was using this abstracted

671
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:03,360
layer on top of it, and I would love to ask somebody, can you have a look at this code

672
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,560
and just tell me if it's total garbage or if I at least understand the principles of

673
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:14,600
this tool that I'm using, because I think I'm doing a decent job and it works, but like

674
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,640
you said, if tomorrow 10,000 people hits this website, is it just going to fall over because

675
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,520
I'm not using it correctly?

676
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,840
I heard somebody speak the other day about using Apollo with GraphQL, and there's a very

677
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,160
good reason you should use Apollo because you can so quickly shoot yourself in the foot

678
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,160
because of the nature of how GraphQL works.

679
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,920
You can actually end up creating 50 queries hitting the database, and where if you use

680
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,880
Apollo, it says, oh, I see what you're trying to do, and it figures it out, and it takes

681
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,480
all of those 50, and it's like, I'm just going to do one query, get this data, and I'm going

682
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,400
to sprinkle it everywhere you need it for you.

683
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,840
If you don't know about that stuff, you're going to just say, hey, it seems to be working

684
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:07,680
fine, everything is great, and then your client launches the website, and the next morning

685
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:13,400
you wake up to a bunch of angry voice messages because their website's down.

686
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,640
Or like a $10,000 bill unexpectedly, stuff like that can happen if you have something

687
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,940
based on, yeah, if you have something based on usage, whatever it is, you can get yourself

688
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,040
into scenarios really quickly where you're just unprepared, and I would love to see more

689
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,600
developer documentation that has a kind of two-tier approach where it's like, here's

690
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,640
how you get started, here's how you actually deploy a real production environment here,

691
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:42,200
because I think that people just expect people to know best practices about that, but I got

692
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,480
to tell you, I've been handed so many projects as a developer where it's like, our last developer

693
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,920
did this mess, can you please un-mess it up, and so nobody knows how to do this stuff.

694
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,080
Obviously, some people do know how to do this, but you don't start out knowing this stuff,

695
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:03,400
so somebody has to tell you along the line how it should go, so whether that needs to

696
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:09,680
be on, the onus has to be on developer documentation, I think writers of documentation should do

697
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,720
a better job of doing this kind of, it is a kind of education, so I think that should

698
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:21,440
happen, but I also think that the keys to those kinds of operations are usually held

699
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,880
by a small number of people at any given company, and so that means that there's not often as

700
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,520
much exposure to those principles of practices, process documents, whatever it might be, there

701
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,960
just aren't as many people who know how to do that stuff in general, so I think we should

702
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,160
try to open up that knowledge more, because even if not everybody is doing it, everybody

703
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,000
should know how to do it, you know, if you're working in tech.

704
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,160
Yeah, I know, for sure, and I think the nice thing about documentation and creating educational

705
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:00,640
material around this is there's less of a need then to be there in person every time.

706
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,640
I can't remember who it was, but there was somebody that I read about that, like if they've

707
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,240
received an email twice, they post them the same question, they write a blog post about

708
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,320
it, so then the next time they get the same question, they just point people at the blog

709
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,560
post, and I thought that is really a clever way of doing this, because that puts the information

710
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:27,360
out there, but it frees up your time, and it makes it discoverable by other people that

711
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,920
just search for like, how do I X, and then it's like, yeah, your blog post post pops

712
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,800
up that was an answer to an email, so I think, like I said, a mentoring network would be

713
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,280
nice, but I understand the difficulty of that.

714
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,960
It's like, it's people's time that you're asking for, and in general, people are pressed

715
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,000
for time to start with, so, you know.

716
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,760
The other thing I've struggled with there is that mentoring in the abstract is very,

717
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,960
it's not very appealing to me.

718
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,400
I mean, mentoring with somebody I don't know, I guess is what I should say, that's what

719
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,520
I mean by mentoring in the abstract, so I've always, you know, been very close with my

720
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,360
teachers, just somebody who was curious and interested in education.

721
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,800
I've always been, you know, I've always been close with my own teachers, and so I've benefited

722
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,400
greatly from a couple of mentors along the way.

723
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,360
Now, these people were not in tech, so I really don't, I mean, I have the benefit of working

724
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:28,720
with my dad pretty closely on one of an ongoing contract project that he's still working on

725
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,920
in his pseudo retirement, so I've kind of gotten to learn a lot from him, but it's a

726
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,880
little bit different when it's family, so I don't have like a, you know, a non-family

727
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:45,400
tech mentor, I don't think, so it would, and that's just because, for no other reason,

728
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,960
for me, I'm a contract worker, had been a contract worker, and it's difficult to form

729
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,240
a long-term relationship with somebody that you trust when you do that kind of work, and

730
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,080
so I do think there's like, I totally see a need for it.

731
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,720
I don't know how people like me could get into, you know, maybe like a Discord server,

732
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,440
like what you're running would be a good place, because I do spend a lot of time hanging out

733
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:13,840
in those places, but I need to feel like a mentor is personally invested in me, and that's

734
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:19,880
what is basically impossible to find, just in the way that I exist professionally on

735
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,440
a day-to-day basis, so.

736
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,440
Yeah.

737
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,200
Yeah, I don't have a solution for it.

738
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,360
I know there's a need.

739
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,560
I'm not entirely 100% sure how to fulfill that need yet.

740
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,320
Maybe it'll happen organically via the Discord server?

741
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,320
I don't know.

742
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,720
I think it's got to be much easier.

743
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,240
It's got to be much easier than just smashing two people together and say, okay, here's

744
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,680
your mentor, which can still happen productively for a lot of people, to be clear, but this

745
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:52,780
is just, for me, I need to, and that's why actually that Discord approach does appeal

746
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:59,120
to me, because I can get a sense for people before I DM them and say, hey, can you help

747
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,000
me with this thing, or whatever it is that way, you can get a sense of who's working

748
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
on what?

749
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,520
Are they going to be interested in your question?

750
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,520
Are you going to feel like you're wasting your time?

751
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:14,120
That kind of stuff, you can pre-figure out some of that before you dive in to a more

752
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
formal relationship.

753
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:24,400
Yeah, that's very true, and I try and regularly post there encouraging people to ask questions,

754
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,840
because I know people ask questions.

755
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,040
I know that.

756
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,560
Working on an open source project on GitHub and stuff like that, that's scary for people.

757
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,800
That's why I've told people, look, we're all working together on this project, but if you're

758
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,480
all uncomfortable about opening the pull request because you feel like, I'm not sure if my

759
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,800
work's good enough, let us, people that you feel comfortable with, create a Google Doc

760
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,120
or something, or a Notion, thing a Notion, and ask people to go and proofread it there.

761
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,720
If that makes you feel more comfortable, and then you can slowly start dipping your toe

762
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:06,080
and maybe put your foot in and see how it feels until you feel comfortable, but I think

763
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:13,120
in the end of the day, you should start building up the confidence to do it and to work in

764
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:20,000
the open and to be okay with receiving feedback that is maybe not always, you're doing a great

765
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
job.

766
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,040
Sometimes it's like, thank you for this, but there's this and this and this thing that

767
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,720
you can do, but I understand and I feel for it.

768
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,960
For me, I had to remind myself of that because I've been working in the open for 11 years

769
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
or more now.

770
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,400
For me, it's almost like if people talk about that, I'm like, what do you mean it's weird?

771
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,760
Then I'm like, remember, you've been doing this for 11 years.

772
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,740
Think about 11 years back when you had to open that first pull request on this repository

773
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,440
that everybody can see.

774
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,440
How did that feel?

775
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:00,600
It was like, oh, right, that was kind of scary, and so you have to sometimes just step back

776
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:06,240
and go back in your own history and remember that it wasn't like it's now.

777
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:14,480
Now maybe it's just how you work, but it wasn't always like that.

778
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,480
Yeah.

779
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:22,200
I recently, I was working on a side project and I was like, what am I going to do with

780
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,200
this thing?

781
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,200
Am I going to turn it into something?

782
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,200
It's a little application.

783
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,080
I play Dungeons and Dragons with my friends and I built a little app to manage my character

784
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:39,120
sheet and I started playing with it and I started forcing myself to use it during sessions,

785
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,600
which was a really fascinating... I mean, it's a similar approach even though it's still

786
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
just me.

787
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,600
I did open it up to the group, but I was the only one who used it because everybody else

788
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,440
had paper character sheets.

789
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,800
I wanted mine digitally, so I kind of opened it up before I was really ready and it didn't

790
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,240
go well every single time.

791
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:03,040
Some of them are, there were some quite spectacular fails of sessions because of it, but I learned

792
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:09,720
a whole lot about my own app that I was working on building it that way and it actually even

793
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,880
kind of changed the course of how I'm going to actually open source it now.

794
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:18,320
I'm going to rebuild the thing in Node and do it that way and I'm going to open source

795
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,320
it.

796
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,480
I learned from that experience that putting it out there is really not the worst thing

797
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,480
in the world.

798
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,480
You just got to go for it.

799
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,480
I'm going to see it.

800
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,440
It's going to be really fun.

801
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,680
I've contributed to some open source projects here and there, but I've never actually built

802
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,800
my own, so I'm hoping maybe eventually I'll have a fun little tool for people to use.

803
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:48,160
Just holding yourself accountable, even publishing that blog post or just deploying that first

804
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,040
staging build, whatever it may be.

805
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:54,560
You don't have to have something that's perfect and being used by tens of thousands of people.

806
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,760
You can just have a thing that works for you.

807
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,960
That's even one step in the right direction of coming to be able to have a better barometer

808
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:02,960
for your own success.

809
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:12,640
Yeah, for sure.

810
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,320
I recently spoke to one of the folks in the MySQL network who's a beginner and I told

811
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:24,040
him you don't always have to build a thing that is going to be the next Twitter or whatever.

812
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:29,720
It can just be something that helps you and maybe four years down the line somebody stumbles

813
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,680
upon it and they're like, oh, this is really cool.

814
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,680
I'm going to use it too.

815
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,240
Now you have a second person using it.

816
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,000
If that even never happens, it's okay because you've learned something.

817
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,120
You've made something that's useful to you and that's good.

818
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,400
There's nothing negative about that.

819
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,800
That's like with the blog post principle that you were talking about earlier, if you get

820
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:53,340
two emails turned into a blog post, I started doing that with myself where if I repeat this

821
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:59,640
process more than once, turn it into a blog post because that's why I have stuff about

822
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:05,320
deploying on DigitalOcean on my blog, just random stuff that's so easy, basic walkthrough

823
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,320
tutorial stuff.

824
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,040
But the reason all those exist on my blog is because I had to keep doing them over and

825
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,360
over again and I kept making the same mistakes in the same places and I'm like, why didn't

826
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,800
I write that down the first time?

827
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,560
Now I've got content, yay.

828
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,560
It's good to do that.

829
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,160
I also look at my own blog posts to go set things up sometimes because I'm like, well,

830
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,160
I've already done this once.

831
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,240
Why would I put myself through it again?

832
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,000
Yeah, no, that's definitely, that is very good advice.

833
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,560
I do it less often than I should.

834
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,080
I sometimes make notes and I never go back to the notes and then the next time I hit

835
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:45,840
the same problem, I'm like, I have fixed this already before, darn it, I have to figure

836
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:49,440
it out all over again.

837
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,360
Cycling back to your podcast and a topic you touched on related to the cultural aspects

838
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:01,240
of tech and I think this is in other industries as well, but being in tech, that's probably

839
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,240
what's easiest to speak to.

840
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,960
The episode I listened to from your podcast was the most latest one, which was about women

841
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
in STEM.

842
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
Yeah.

843
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,960
And I've spoken to a couple of women on the podcast before who it's like getting into

844
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:19,680
that and had very different experiences based on where they came from culturally.

845
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,720
Also physically, like the one was US native, the other one was from Mexico that recently

846
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:32,920
moved to the US, but they're still struggling with some aspects of being a non-native American.

847
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:40,600
And so this is an area for me that I think needs a lot of work, so I was very glad to

848
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,920
see that you've really highlighted and dedicated a whole podcast episode to it.

849
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,800
If you have to share with us, because I would encourage everybody to go listen to that episode

850
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:56,480
instead of trying to rehash it here, but what I would like is if you can give us the big

851
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,080
takeaways that you've discovered through talking through that topic.

852
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,560
Yeah.

853
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:12,200
I mean, I think at this point, most people are aware of the problems.

854
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:19,000
They're the sort of more loud media confronting issues where you get people, sexual assault

855
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,240
in the workplace, stuff like that.

856
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,920
We've got problems there, but then we also just have things like just the sheer numbers,

857
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,440
just representation in tech is still wildly imbalanced.

858
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,280
There's just a very wide gender disparity.

859
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,520
So yeah, that episode is just kind of all about that.

860
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,320
And it mostly exists, it's going to be the fact that we have to start making progress

861
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,320
right now because we're backsliding, we're actually reverting to an even worse state

862
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,400
in terms of these things.

863
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:53,640
So we need to, and I mean, there's some extent to which some people think this isn't a problem

864
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,520
to be solved because it's one of interests.

865
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:02,080
By that I mean, well, it's fine because women don't go into tech because they're not interested

866
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:11,040
in tech, which is if you work with anyone under the age of 20, which through my work

867
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,800
on the podcast and for my partner, I'm exposed to young learners, you know that women are

868
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,360
just as interested, girls are just as interested in technology as anyone else.

869
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:30,040
So it gets a little, the main takeaway from the episode is really just me asking the question

870
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:39,080
if half the world is, if 50% of people are women, why are like 19% of software engineers

871
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,080
women?

872
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:47,760
It just doesn't even, and just asking the question is an affront sometimes to folks.

873
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,800
But for me, it really is just like the question, isn't that weird?

874
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,280
Doesn't that strike people as weird that there's such an imbalance in particular career fields

875
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:02,140
and why, how do we get where we are?

876
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,560
How do we get past where we are?

877
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,400
That's everything that we tackle in the lesson.

878
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,640
But for me, I think the main focus is just on like, how are we going to start to overturn

879
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,640
some of this?

880
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,640
How are we going to encourage?

881
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,200
And I think it starts with some of our youngest learners because I think some of the disparities

882
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:25,440
around gender representation in tech start very, very young because we encourage our

883
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,040
girls to play with certain toys and dress in certain ways.

884
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:34,840
And we encourage boys to do different things.

885
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:39,000
And we definitely don't leave a lot of room for other gender expression in there anywhere

886
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
either.

887
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:48,440
So there's just like a lot of work to be done to strip all of that out of the space.

888
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,960
And I also think that the other main point that I guess I would take away is that if

889
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,640
you're lacking representation of anyone in your workplace, you're missing an opportunity

890
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:04,800
to do better than you're doing because you don't have that unique voice on your

891
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,280
staff or whatever it is.

892
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,880
If you don't have that, then you're just doing yourself a disservice from a business

893
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,540
perspective even.

894
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,320
So it just makes business sense to be better about this stuff.

895
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:18,080
But anyway, yeah, that was the kind of, that was that.

896
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,920
I had gotten particularly frustrated about it because we'd been listening to a podcast

897
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,320
about For All Mankind, which is a TV show about the space race, kind of re-imagined

898
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:34,600
history of the space race between USSR and the United States and it's a really fun show.

899
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,640
But they had a companion podcast and it was just kind of talking about the history of

900
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:45,240
involvement of women in NASA and astronaut training programs and how much more difficult

901
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,960
it was for them just because they were women.

902
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,880
So that was kind of the inspiration for all of that episode.

903
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:55,560
But yeah, it was a fun conversation, but we still have a ways to go.

904
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,560
Yeah, I know for sure.

905
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:03,440
And I mean, yeah, I totally call bullshit on the whole interest thing, just to be blunt,

906
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:10,640
because if you want proof that I'm right in this situation, go listen to the episode I

907
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:17,400
did with Pamela Rodriguez and you'll hear, I'm not just talking towards you like people

908
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,060
who hear this.

909
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:22,960
If you think it's an interest problem, go listen to that episode.

910
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:30,240
The way she grew up in Mexico, you're not encouraged as a girl to go into technology.

911
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,480
That's not your field, it's something boys do.

912
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,360
That is the message that is clearly being said to them.

913
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:42,600
She was lucky in that her parents encouraged her to go and do that because I believe her

914
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,960
father was also in tech.

915
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,400
And so that helped.

916
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:52,600
But for so many other people, so many other women in Mexico, that is not even an avenue

917
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,680
they think to explore, not because they're not interested, just because you're told that

918
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,640
it's not something you would be interested in.

919
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:07,840
And one thing that I, a while ago, realized is representation is a big part of it too.

920
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:13,600
If you do not see somebody like yourself in a role, it's hard for you to have something

921
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:20,120
to strive towards because you can't, I can never find the appropriate word for this,

922
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,280
but there's no connection there.

923
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,200
It's like you just see a bunch of people that's not you doing the work.

924
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:31,200
And so you think that, oh, maybe it's not meant for me then.

925
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,480
And so it's those bubbles we need to burst and say, no, that's untrue.

926
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,920
And we need to lift up people who are trying to change that, give them a voice, give them

927
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:49,160
a platform to talk and say, hey, I'm like you and I'm doing this, you can do it too.

928
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,520
Because yeah, it's not an interesting, it has nothing to do with that.

929
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,240
It's literally just people don't see themselves in these roles and therefore they don't pursue

930
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,240
them.

931
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,240
No.

932
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,880
There's a musical, it actually is just closing I think now, called Come From Away, that ran

933
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,200
on Broadway for a couple of years.

934
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:16,360
And it's about what happened in Gander, Newfoundland on 9-11 when they had to divert all of this

935
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,840
plane traffic to this tiny little island in the middle of nowhere.

936
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:27,720
So that's the story of the show, but there's a moment in it where there's a character,

937
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:35,480
she's a pilot and she's singing about how, well, the whole song is just basically about

938
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:41,920
how she grew up with everyone around her telling her that being a pilot is not for girls.

939
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:48,560
And she evolves into this woman with this flourishing career as a pilot, but did it

940
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,960
despite the fact that she could, despite the fact that everyone around her was telling

941
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:58,240
her this isn't for you, her peers or colleagues, even her co-workers, her female co-workers

942
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:04,240
didn't like her, based on a real person, they didn't like her because she was perceived

943
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:08,240
to be of a higher status than they were as attendants on the flight.

944
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:14,040
So anyway, all this kind of stuff that happens, but that song makes me cry every single time.

945
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,360
My dad is a pilot too.

946
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,600
You can tell that my dad being in tech and my dad being a pilot has a lot to do with

947
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,160
all of this stuff, but he's kind of the reason I got into all of this stuff.

948
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:27,040
But yeah, there's a line in there about basically, yeah, just about like being a pilot and stuff.

949
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:32,880
And it makes me cry every single time because I just like to see myself represented.

950
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:39,360
I like to see some strong female characters stand up and say, look at what I did, despite

951
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:45,240
the fact everyone around me told me I couldn't or never invited me in or, you know, I was

952
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,720
never given the opportunity, I had to take it for myself.

953
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:57,160
So I really like that, just because it is so important to be able to see that's, yes,

954
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,160
that's me.

955
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,160
Yeah.

956
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,800
Identifying with peers, I mean, the same thing happens in media, like being able to find

957
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,720
yourself in media is important for a lot of people.

958
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:15,920
So yeah, it definitely does matter, having examples of other, you know, of peers with

959
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,520
whom you feel like you can share something and identify and grow is very important.

960
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,520
Yeah.

961
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:24,400
Apparently that's one of the reasons why Fresh Prince of Ballet was such a popular show,

962
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,920
because it was one of the first ones that was an all-black cast.

963
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:35,400
And the people who played it weren't like poor, like the father was a really successful

964
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,880
person in law, they had a big house, they were living in like, you know, they had riches

965
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,000
and wealth and all that kind of stuff.

966
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,520
But then also you had this representation from the other side, like the person who came

967
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:53,680
from, you know, down and out and is now living up here and like there's this difference.

968
01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:00,840
But the fact that you had those two different economic aspects, but then you had an all-black

969
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:07,000
cast as well, that made a big connection with a lot of people, and they could see themselves

970
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:13,120
and they could also see themselves not being the one that lives in the projects or whatever

971
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:18,440
you want to call it, but the one that lives in the big house in Ballet, you know.

972
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,680
So that was interesting when I learned about that, I never thought about it that way.

973
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,720
And when somebody like vocalized it, it was like, oh, goodness gracious, yeah, that makes

974
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,720
total sense.

975
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:33,480
And for me, it's normal to see white folks living in big houses and being really successful

976
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,980
and running billion dollar companies.

977
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:42,960
But if you don't see that as somebody that's not me, then it's hard.

978
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,120
Like you feel like you have to be the trailblazer and it's hard to be the first person, right?

979
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:51,280
It's always hard to be the first one to say, I'm going to change it, I'm going to do this

980
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,280
thing different.

981
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:59,600
Yeah, it can be too weird to as a woman in tech, because I don't go around thinking of

982
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:04,120
my own experience as gendered in tech, I just think of my experience.

983
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:09,000
So I don't, when I'm living in it, I don't look around and think like, oh, well, this

984
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,160
is happening because I'm a woman or because I'm not a man or whatever it might be.

985
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,640
I don't have those kinds of thoughts.

986
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,760
But the problem is, is that maybe nobody does.

987
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:23,560
We always think of these things in terms of the systemic problems and systemic under representations

988
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:28,600
and we tend to big picture these things to the point of almost oblivion because we don't

989
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:34,240
know what we can do about them anymore when we think of them as big widespread issues

990
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:35,240
to confront.

991
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:40,040
It's almost like a way of abstracting it into nothingness.

992
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:50,760
So I think that I have had some struggles in my own career just being in such spaces

993
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:55,880
that are so dominated by a single kind of voice and it's usually a white voice and it's

994
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,720
usually a male voice and that's just the way it is.

995
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:06,100
It doesn't bother me that that's the default necessarily, but it does bother me when we

996
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,400
forget that there's a default that we've selected.

997
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:21,640
So it can cause monoculture if nothing else for sure, which is something I'd like to avoid.

998
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,640
Yeah.

999
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,920
Like you said, it's literally like it's bad for business and I mean, I've experienced

1000
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,960
this not in the business sense, but in the community sense.

1001
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:37,320
Some of the stuff that we've done, we have people from all over and people whose native

1002
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:44,400
language isn't English has called out some of the stuff that I wrote as like, it's good,

1003
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:49,640
but like if somebody with my background reads this, I'm going to find this specific area

1004
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,640
really complicated.

1005
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,520
Like I couldn't understand what you were trying to say here and then they would like, and

1006
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,920
it's amazing how deep that the guy would dive into this and like trying to understand what

1007
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,840
I'm trying to say and I'm like, holy cow.

1008
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,920
And then he comes to me and he says like, could we reword it this way and I'm like,

1009
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,920
of course we can.

1010
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,880
And that makes so much sense that that is just going to make, and now it's more approachable

1011
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,600
for a lot of people.

1012
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,600
That's like accessibility.

1013
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:21,320
Like you do a thing that makes it accessible to this group of people and hey, guess what

1014
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,320
happens?

1015
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,880
A whole bunch of other people benefit from it as well.

1016
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:31,240
So I think that's the thing, changing the mindset to what you benefit, the benefit you

1017
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,280
derive when you do this thing might be what it takes to change minds.

1018
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:41,400
Because I'm not sure, there's an instant hostility toward almost anything you try to say about

1019
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:49,800
this in tech and the reason, I mean, it kind of makes sense because we just don't have,

1020
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,580
we don't have the tools, we don't have the culture, we don't even have the practices

1021
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:59,400
and habits of conversation to be able to have the difficult talks about this stuff that

1022
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,400
we need.

1023
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,440
So having a really good conversation about a difficult topic, like why are there so many

1024
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:09,600
men in this office and not as many women or something, like if that's the topic, having

1025
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,520
a really difficult conversation about that takes skill and it's not something that can

1026
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,040
just be expected to go well.

1027
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:23,720
And I think that that's like, so I think that it can be really difficult because there aren't

1028
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:29,640
a lot of tools that business leaders are given to know how to navigate some of those kinds

1029
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,640
of conversations.

1030
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,560
We just kind of assume we have the best idea in the room and that everyone's going to listen

1031
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:43,400
to us and that our CEO word is gold or whatever, but we need to realize that these difficult

1032
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:50,260
kinds of conversations need to happen in a particular moderated civil way and they actually

1033
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:51,260
do need to happen.

1034
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:53,960
We can't just say, yeah, we're not going to talk about politics in the workplace, that

1035
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:54,960
kind of thing.

1036
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,000
Like that was a real big trend a couple of years ago, it was like Basecamp and Coinbase,

1037
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,880
I think both within like a week of each other, the CEOs were like, no politics in the workplace.

1038
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:09,640
And I'm just like, we are political creatures, like we have to exist in the world, which

1039
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:14,760
means that politics is going to affect our lives, so we have to find a way to acknowledge

1040
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:21,200
difficulties in our workplace and still be productive on the other side of them.

1041
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:27,700
So I was just kind of disturbed by that chilling effect, but at the same time, I get why people

1042
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:32,640
are hesitant about having these conversations because they can go so badly.

1043
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:39,440
They can go very wrong, that is for sure, they definitely can.

1044
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,040
This has been a great conversation, I tend to say that with all of these, it's so great

1045
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,800
to just be able to talk to people about all these things and like hear different perspectives

1046
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,920
and it's always eye-opening, I really enjoy it.

1047
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,840
I'm glad I started it and I can't remember who it was, but there was some podcast that

1048
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,880
said everybody should have a podcast and I'm starting to agree, it's such a great medium

1049
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,320
and to just get to speak with such a wide variety of people and it broadens your perspective,

1050
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:10,080
it's almost like traveling in a sense.

1051
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,560
So yeah, I'm going to go dive into your podcast now that you've been telling me about these

1052
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,800
episodes, it sounds fascinating, I'm going to have to give a listen.

1053
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,140
Yeah, and I'd love your feedback, like I'm learning as I'm doing this, like I have no

1054
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:26,440
background in podcasting, I just decided one day to start doing it.

1055
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,840
I did not either, so you just kind of seems to be the way of it.

1056
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,320
Yeah, you just wing it.

1057
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,320
Start going.

1058
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,600
Yeah, for sure.

1059
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:41,340
So to close this out, I've kind of two things, maybe one can be just general advice to people

1060
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:50,400
getting starting to learn to code and new to development, any words of wisdom?

1061
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:58,480
Yeah, I think the thing that has helped me most is establishing rituals.

1062
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,560
I call them rituals, but it's really just good habits.

1063
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,400
I mean, if I call them rituals, then I think I'm cool.

1064
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,300
So you know, but good habits throughout the day.

1065
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:13,600
So I used to be a real night owl and I still do stay up late, but I used to think that

1066
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,800
I liked staying up late and sleeping in.

1067
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,280
But what I actually like is having time in the morning to wake up before I jump in to

1068
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,440
tasks.

1069
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:29,200
So I, again, this is back to the kind of scheduling thing, but I go to bed at a reasonable hour

1070
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:34,400
most nights now and I get up almost every day at eight and even though I work from home

1071
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,720
and could get up at noon if I wanted to, but I get up at a set schedule every day.

1072
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:46,360
And I take up my dog on a walk at a set schedule every day and establishing those things for

1073
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:53,640
me has been, it's freed me up to think about my work and not to have to think about managing

1074
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:57,700
my life and schedule, which is kind of infecting some of my workflow.

1075
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:04,800
So I think that, again, especially if you're a solopreneur or a freelancer or you're just

1076
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,400
starting out and you're self-directed, if you have to be in charge of your own time

1077
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:16,680
and also if you struggle with distractions or ADHD or your brain works like mine, coming

1078
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:22,560
into habits that you can call your own that you actually relish, like I make, I don't

1079
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,000
have been drinking as much coffee, but I used to make my coffee every single morning at

1080
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
the same exact minute.

1081
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,400
And I light a little candle when I come into my office every single time so that it smells

1082
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,280
nice and I play music on my sound system every single time.

1083
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,980
I get into the workspace and I'm lucky to have a home office too.

1084
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:42,600
It's been important to have a separated work space that isn't part of my life space.

1085
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,280
But coming up with these things that are just kind of like things that you do every day

1086
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:53,720
has been, I think, key to my feeling like I have a more coherent grasp on my own professional

1087
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,120
life these last couple of months, especially as I've been working through some of these

1088
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,120
things.

1089
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,980
So that would maybe be the bit of advice that I would give.

1090
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:02,520
Just come up with your rituals.

1091
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,560
You can define them.

1092
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,040
But coming up with these things will help you kind of maintain a good sleep schedule,

1093
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:13,840
healthy work-life balance, and just the motivation to keep going.

1094
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,840
Yeah.

1095
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,840
That's great advice.

1096
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,840
Definitely.

1097
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:23,680
And you kind of alluded to some things, I guess, now like music and coffee and things

1098
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,680
like that.

1099
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,160
What do you do in your downtime?

1100
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,160
Walking the dog?

1101
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,160
Yeah.

1102
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,160
Walking the dog, yes.

1103
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,160
I have a golden retriever.

1104
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:34,040
I walk the golden retriever, my partner's dog.

1105
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,040
I make music.

1106
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,840
I'm actually, my office has got a bunch of guitars and keyboards and stuff in here.

1107
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,520
But that's mostly just for me.

1108
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,380
I don't really publish, I mean, it's on the internet, but I don't, you know, there's some

1109
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,120
things that I want to be just for me.

1110
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:51,000
So I do make music.

1111
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,200
I like, I mean, I do stuff like 3D printing.

1112
01:16:55,200 --> 01:17:00,120
It's any like tinkering or art or just any kind of creative pursuit.

1113
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,480
I'll do it.

1114
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:07,800
I've got bins and bins full of crafty stuff and electronics and Arduino kits and just

1115
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,240
whatever tinkering is to be done, I'm going to be doing it because I just enjoy it.

1116
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:17,040
So yeah, it's a little bit of everything, a little bit of travel, but a lot of music

1117
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,120
has always been important in my life and I do like making it.

1118
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:22,120
Yeah.

1119
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,120
That's great.

1120
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,120
Well, thanks so much, Chelsea.

1121
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,600

1122
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,600
Yeah, thank you.

1123
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,840
