Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:09.520
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.520
Hey, Chelsea.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.720
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:12.720 --> 00:13.720
Yeah.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.720
Thank you for having me.

00:14.720 --> 00:15.720
Thanks so much for joining.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.400
I really appreciate it.

00:18.400 --> 00:24.160
So you were one of the many people that reached out over polywork when I did my initial, like,

00:24.160 --> 00:26.040
are people interested in this kind of thing?

00:26.040 --> 00:28.920
And I'm still blinded by how many people were interested.

00:28.920 --> 00:35.880
So you were one of the folks, and then I started doing it, and I got so caught up in the whole

00:35.880 --> 00:38.840
process and all the other things that I do.

00:38.840 --> 00:42.800
But then eventually, I was able to get back to you, and we were able to set this up.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.000
So I'm so glad that we were able to do this.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.880
I think this is going to be a really interesting conversation.

00:48.880 --> 00:54.400
I've done some research about you and found some really interesting things that I'd like

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
to dig into.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.920
So I'm looking forward to the conversation.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
Yeah.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.920
Yeah.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.920
Yeah.

01:00.920 --> 01:01.920
Thanks for reaching out.

01:01.920 --> 01:06.000
I've been having fun making some connections on polywork, and I saw that.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.680
And I was just very interested in your project and what you're doing.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.560
So that's kind of what prompted me to respond.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.520
It sounded like you were doing some really interesting work yourself.

01:14.520 --> 01:15.520
Oh, that's good to hear.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.520
Glad to be here.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.520
Yeah.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.040
So I normally ask people to write a little bio in the document, but that's more for me

01:22.040 --> 01:24.600
to use when I post it.

01:24.600 --> 01:30.720
In the beginning, I read it out, but I thought, oh, it's so been done, I want to do it differently.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.800
So what I decided to do is I'm going to let you tell your story instead of me giving a

01:35.800 --> 01:37.600
summary of your life story.

01:37.600 --> 01:45.520
So take as long as you want, go as far back as you'd like, bring us up to the current

01:45.520 --> 01:46.520
day.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.520
Yeah.

01:47.520 --> 01:55.680
So just in general, I'm a software engineer and creator, I guess, generally speaking.

01:55.680 --> 02:03.800
I do a whole bunch of different work in my day to day, but I got my start really when

02:03.800 --> 02:04.800
I was a kid.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.160
My dad started a software company when he was just out of college, so I grew up with

02:09.160 --> 02:13.120
computers and the internet and being around all that stuff and developed an interest in

02:13.120 --> 02:15.000
it pretty early in my life.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.560
And so I went to college for, well, the degree was in liberal arts.

02:20.560 --> 02:27.160
It's a background in philosophy and mathematics and science and music, everything.

02:27.160 --> 02:32.240
It was a pretty interesting program, unique as far as I could tell at the time.

02:32.240 --> 02:35.560
I was at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland.

02:35.560 --> 02:38.360
So that's where I got my undergraduate degree.

02:38.360 --> 02:43.680
I went on to get a master's in philosophy and education from Teachers College at Columbia

02:43.680 --> 02:48.880
University, and you can see that none of this has anything to do with technology yet.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.440
So that's my formal background.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.800
Yeah, that's my formal educational background.

02:53.800 --> 02:59.980
And then I'm mostly self-taught with everything that I've done over the years with the tech

02:59.980 --> 03:01.680
side of things.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.640
But I did grow up around it.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.520
It's been ever present in my life.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.620
So I've had a lot of exposure to tech and just lots of tinkering over the years.

03:10.620 --> 03:16.800
And so I started out, I kind of wandered around a little bit after grad school and I hadn't

03:16.800 --> 03:19.600
really found a way yet, but I just started teaching myself how to build websites.

03:19.600 --> 03:25.280
And I went from there and now I do all kinds of things, write software and still make websites.

03:25.280 --> 03:32.720
And I run a podcast and I just do a little bit of whatever I can do.

03:32.720 --> 03:38.400
I like to craft my own career around whatever keeps me learning the most.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.880
So I'm likely to get bored if I'm working on something for a really long time and not

03:42.880 --> 03:43.880
changing it up.

03:43.880 --> 03:47.160
So that's kind of how I've built my professional life so far.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, I can totally, I know what you're saying.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Me too.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.600
I need different things, otherwise it just gets, and I want to keep learning.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.600
That's the big thing.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.000
And I'm naturally curious.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.640
And so I was in the corporate world for a while and it just didn't fit at all.

04:07.640 --> 04:13.760
I was so frustrated and it was so meaningless that I just felt like, no, no, no, this is

04:13.760 --> 04:14.760
not it.

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
This is not it for me.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.720
So yeah, the whole polywork philosophy really clicked with me, especially when I heard the

04:20.720 --> 04:25.960
founder express what it means, because at first I was just like, oh, it's another shining

04:25.960 --> 04:26.960
little social network.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.680
Let me go see what it's about.

04:28.680 --> 04:33.280
And then when he explained it, I was like, oh, right.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.720
That is exactly what I was looking for.

04:35.720 --> 04:36.720
So it's great.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.720
Yeah.

04:37.720 --> 04:43.800
So I've spoken to a couple of early stage folks so far on the podcast and also just

04:43.800 --> 04:50.360
in general, I have some folks around me and I've mentored some people in the past.

04:50.360 --> 04:55.280
And the one thing that's, I don't think it's something I could really go away ever, but

04:55.280 --> 05:02.720
I do understand tech has become, I don't know what the right words are, but it's become

05:02.720 --> 05:08.760
this profession that is almost a little bit elitist in a way.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.880
I think we want to change it.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.080
I think we acknowledge there's a problem there and it shouldn't be like everybody's welcome

05:13.080 --> 05:18.880
and anybody can do this, you know, if you put your mind to it.

05:18.880 --> 05:23.840
But maybe it's the nature of the work, maybe it is the environment you work in.

05:23.840 --> 05:28.000
I'm not sure exactly what is leading to this, but the one thing that I've heard from everybody

05:28.000 --> 05:34.840
is even more so than finding like good education material or finding good mentors or anything

05:34.840 --> 05:40.360
like that, the one thing that they find is imposter syndrome hitting them from day one

05:40.360 --> 05:41.360
almost.

05:41.360 --> 05:47.640
And sometimes, yeah, and sometimes just feeling like they're not sure if they made the right

05:47.640 --> 05:51.480
choice, like especially people that are changing careers.

05:51.480 --> 05:57.640
And I was looking at your blog and you recently posted one called Coming Home.

05:57.640 --> 06:04.120
And in that, you mentioned the sense of unbelonging amongst peers and leaders and how it relates

06:04.120 --> 06:07.600
to how we measure ourselves.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.000
And so I'd like for you to dig into that a little bit if you don't mind.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.880
Yeah, I went to my 10-year college reunion, which is always weird.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.240
I think college reunions are just going to be weird no matter what because it's just

06:21.240 --> 06:22.240
awkward.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.440
You don't remember people, blah, blah, blah.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.160
But it was a really good time.

06:25.160 --> 06:30.320
It was really neat to see everyone and hear about everybody's professional progress and

06:30.320 --> 06:31.800
meet their kids and all of these things.

06:31.800 --> 06:37.960
But I went with my partner and we were talking about it afterwards and she was like, everyone

06:37.960 --> 06:44.520
who was sitting around in that circle talking, almost everyone at least, it seemed like everyone

06:44.520 --> 06:52.640
had taken these almost taken years to kind of meander around and end up, they almost

06:52.640 --> 06:57.400
kind of had this delay, this like six or so year delay post-college where they were wandering

06:57.400 --> 07:00.760
trying to figure out what it is they really wanted to do with themselves.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.880
And some people are still wandering, so that's fair too.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.360
It takes longer sometimes.

07:05.360 --> 07:11.160
But there's this delay in kind of kicking in with what many of us probably would consider

07:11.160 --> 07:17.480
real professional progress that she observed from that group that I thought was very interesting.

07:17.480 --> 07:22.600
And I think imposter syndrome probably, I mean, in my case, it definitely does have something

07:22.600 --> 07:25.240
to do with it and probably did with these peers too.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.680
But the idea that I was thinking about was just sort of like, well, everything that everyone's

07:29.680 --> 07:35.160
saying here, we're all comparing ourselves to an ideal, to that person that we idolize,

07:35.160 --> 07:37.160
to whomever it may be.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.760
We're comparing ourselves to a standard that we don't think we've reached yet.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.640
That's kind of natural to do.

07:42.640 --> 07:48.600
But when you do that, you don't often remember to look on the other side of the spectrum

07:48.600 --> 07:53.560
of your own progress because it's impolite to do so usually.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.620
You don't want to be like, oh, I'm better than that person.

07:56.620 --> 08:02.600
So you don't usually allow yourself to do that kind of reflective thinking.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.060
It's just like a bad habit.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.320
It's considered impolite, whatever it might be.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.000
So it's not something that we are prompted to do very often.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
We're not prompted to look either at others or even just measure against our own progress

08:14.000 --> 08:17.560
and look back and say, wow, I'm much better than that.

08:17.560 --> 08:24.520
I have at least the skills to know that I have moved from point A to point B along my

08:24.520 --> 08:26.740
journey of progress.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.880
So even just having a moment to self-reflect can be useful sometimes and we often don't

08:30.880 --> 08:33.800
make that time for ourselves in our professional lives.

08:33.800 --> 08:39.280
But yeah, that was the thought with that post, it was just like I definitely have struggled

08:39.280 --> 08:46.680
with unbelonging and imposter syndrome, but I have, I guess I would say I've recently

08:46.680 --> 08:54.240
started to become more comfortable just knowing what I used to not be able to do and can do

08:54.240 --> 08:55.240
now.

08:55.240 --> 09:02.480
Yeah, so that kind of was the reason for that post was that social occasion where that feeling

09:02.480 --> 09:07.760
seemed to be felt by people my age and people with whom I graduated and things like that.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.760
Yeah, yeah.

09:08.760 --> 09:13.760
Do you think, it's interesting to say that you've recently started to be able to deal

09:13.760 --> 09:14.760
with it better.

09:14.760 --> 09:19.600
Do you think this is something that comes with experience or age or is it a combination

09:19.600 --> 09:20.600
of it?

09:20.600 --> 09:27.640
Because for me, I think, I'm still ice and struggle with it heavily, but I am better.

09:27.640 --> 09:31.160
If I'm honest with myself, I am doing better with it.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.720
And I do think age for me plays a role in that.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.720
I'm at a point now where I feel like I don't have to prove myself so much anymore.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.920
I don't have that need so much anymore.

09:43.920 --> 09:50.040
Yeah, I think it must have something to do with it.

09:50.040 --> 09:56.560
I think you can't really get that reflective quality until you've done some things that

09:56.560 --> 10:00.880
you can reflect on, so you're really not going to have that backward looking experience.

10:00.880 --> 10:14.000
But yeah, I think it's just important to give yourself time to establish that you care about

10:14.000 --> 10:21.200
something professionally, first of all, because before you do that, you don't have a standard

10:21.200 --> 10:28.640
against which to measure your own, I don't know, your own chunk of your career, whatever

10:28.640 --> 10:33.480
it is, in the general world, the general professional world, until you've had a little bit of time

10:33.480 --> 10:37.840
to establish yourself, learn what you like and don't like, until you've had some time

10:37.840 --> 10:41.040
to try and fail a couple of times.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.440
It's hard to form that perspective.

10:42.440 --> 10:47.400
But I think that it's possible to work on it, certainly, if you're a little impatient

10:47.400 --> 10:48.800
without waiting.

10:48.800 --> 10:54.280
There are things you can do, like even polywork you mentioned has been good for me to address

10:54.280 --> 10:56.080
some of these things.

10:56.080 --> 11:02.560
I think finding accountability to put yourself out there a little more aggressively than

11:02.560 --> 11:07.760
you might be comfortable with doing, so having professional peers publish that blog post

11:07.760 --> 11:11.160
before you're really ready and have them review it, things like that.

11:11.160 --> 11:15.120
Stop getting in your own way a little bit is the way I would describe it.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.280
It's just like, okay, I'm holding on to this so tightly because I want to be a perfectionist

11:19.280 --> 11:22.960
about it, but do I really need to be in the way of this right now because I'm the one

11:22.960 --> 11:25.480
who has to push the publish button.

11:25.480 --> 11:30.280
I can worry about it being perfect all day long, but I still haven't pushed the publish

11:30.280 --> 11:31.920
button.

11:31.920 --> 11:36.760
That for me was what was getting in my way.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.360
I was my own worst enemy there.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.920
Yeah, I think that's common.

11:39.920 --> 11:46.720
I know my daughter, for example, she's got in between a couple of ideas of what she wants

11:46.720 --> 11:55.120
to do, but I know that she has a real passion for writing.

11:55.120 --> 11:59.520
I think her work is really good, and I've told her that, but I don't think she believes

11:59.520 --> 12:00.520
it.

12:00.520 --> 12:06.680
I think it's because there's this fear, and I'd like to ask you this because it leads

12:06.680 --> 12:11.880
into this second topic that I've had in the dark.

12:11.880 --> 12:16.480
I think social media plays a big role here, right?

12:16.480 --> 12:24.960
It's created this idea of perfection that does not really exist.

12:24.960 --> 12:36.000
People are so scared of being wrong, and I don't understand when that switch flipped

12:36.000 --> 12:42.200
over and we went to this thing where it's such a bad thing to sometimes be wrong, where

12:42.200 --> 12:52.320
it's such a terrible thing to sometimes fail, and where people always want to show or pinpoint

12:52.320 --> 12:58.720
the things that you didn't do well, instead of just celebrating the humanity of that and

12:58.720 --> 13:04.760
celebrating, having an idea and putting it out there.

13:04.760 --> 13:13.740
I ran into this with a... I found a guy on LinkedIn that made a little glove that has

13:13.740 --> 13:19.120
these sensors on it, and so if he moves it around, it can turn silent and get into audio,

13:19.120 --> 13:21.840
but he's also put NFT chips on each finger.

13:21.840 --> 13:26.800
If you program it, then if they get near to an object, like a blind person, it can tell

13:26.800 --> 13:31.600
them what the object is, and I thought, that is so cool.

13:31.600 --> 13:36.760
That is such a great idea, and I shared it in one of the Slack servers that I used to

13:36.760 --> 13:42.600
be on, and wow, did people poo over that, all over that.

13:42.600 --> 13:48.080
They did not say, this is a great idea, but it has some flaws.

13:48.080 --> 13:54.000
It was just all out, this is like, oh, not that terrible idea, and I was like, I'm leaving

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
because this is super toxic, I don't want to be in a place where you criticize ideas,

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
because I think ideas is what's going to move us forward as humanity, and if you're going

14:05.000 --> 14:09.720
to start just killing people's initiative, then I don't know where we're going.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.520
I rambled a little bit there, but I'd like your...

14:12.520 --> 14:13.840
No, no, not at all.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.840
I think that social media definitely plays a role.

14:16.840 --> 14:23.640
I also think it's much easier to respond with negative criticism than it is to offer suggestions

14:23.640 --> 14:32.760
for how to improve things, especially in online communities where anonymity doesn't kick in

14:32.760 --> 14:36.440
and say that it's not that little voice in the back, you don't have that little voice

14:36.440 --> 14:40.080
in the back of your head that says, hey, maybe think before you say this out loud, because

14:40.080 --> 14:45.320
you're not looking at the person's eyes, you're not going to insult them to their face.

14:45.320 --> 14:49.280
Those kinds of things that happen in face-to-face interactions with people, and we've had even

14:49.280 --> 14:53.960
less of that since COVID, so I think the problems have gotten more intense, but those are the

14:53.960 --> 15:01.240
sorts of things that allow us to pause and take a breath and maybe just not sling that

15:01.240 --> 15:03.960
mean comment or criticism or whatever.

15:03.960 --> 15:08.400
All of that's absent on social media, so unless you're very, very good at self-moderating,

15:08.400 --> 15:14.200
which hardly any of us are, it's just so easy to just pop in and be like, well, I don't

15:14.200 --> 15:18.040
like that, I don't like the colors, I don't like the whatever it may be.

15:18.040 --> 15:24.920
I see a lot of design stuff on Twitter, and any time any redesign of anything is released,

15:24.920 --> 15:31.320
it's just a huge thread of thousands and thousands of, I like the old one better, or just whatever

15:31.320 --> 15:32.720
the criticism may be.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.840
It's just because it's so easy.

15:34.840 --> 15:40.160
It's much more difficult to confront a problem and say, hey, this is a good start.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.800
I think I would maybe think about improving it in this direction.

15:44.800 --> 15:50.720
It requires you to think and do some work in order to engage that way, so many of us

15:50.720 --> 15:57.000
not having the time usually just choose the pithy little criticism.

15:57.000 --> 16:04.480
But I was going to say earlier too, I think that writers would probably have this problem

16:04.480 --> 16:11.280
more than others, being isolated from a professional network, which I also do find myself feeling

16:11.280 --> 16:17.360
that I am, just because I've worked up to this point, I've now actually started an LLC,

16:17.360 --> 16:20.080
but up to this point I was just working as a freelancer, so like a contract, I didn't

16:20.080 --> 16:24.000
have a company, I was just operating as me.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.760
But I think when you run a consultancy like that, it doesn't give you a whole lot of opportunities

16:30.760 --> 16:37.120
to just sit down with peers and hear whether or not the work you're doing is any good.

16:37.120 --> 16:42.160
You hope that the client's happy with the project at the end of the day, but there's

16:42.160 --> 16:47.720
not a lot of quarterly review with your manager to tell you how you're doing kind of stuff

16:47.720 --> 16:51.120
as a freelancer or a solopreneur or whatever it may be.

16:51.120 --> 16:56.240
While that most of the time doesn't bother me, when I think about how I'm doing professionally

16:56.240 --> 17:01.920
and how I want to improve professionally, I have to go seek out feedback from non-traditional

17:01.920 --> 17:05.760
sources in order to get it, and it's very hard to do that, and it's especially hard

17:05.760 --> 17:11.900
to do that and go find the positive feedback that would help you manage that imposter syndrome.

17:11.900 --> 17:17.240
So I would imagine, I think writers would be particularly challenged by that for the

17:17.240 --> 17:18.240
same reasons.

17:18.240 --> 17:23.120
It's like your work product everybody can read and they can like it or not like it,

17:23.120 --> 17:26.880
but how do you appeal to the professionals who could help shape your career?

17:26.880 --> 17:31.120
How do you reach out to people who can give you a positive, valuable feedback like when

17:31.120 --> 17:38.120
you need it, when you're most drained or most in need of some help?

17:38.120 --> 17:39.120
Yeah.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.120
Yeah.

17:40.120 --> 17:45.000
I think that's a very, very good point, and I'm going through that, and I think I found

17:45.000 --> 17:52.040
some things that's helping, but there's still a gap there, and so I think this is something

17:52.040 --> 18:00.440
that beginners also struggle with is finding mentors that build them up and won't break

18:00.440 --> 18:01.720
the spirit.

18:01.720 --> 18:08.800
So that's why I'm really careful about managing the MySQL network, the Discord server aspect

18:08.800 --> 18:10.880
of it really, really closely.

18:10.880 --> 18:14.800
Like daily, I open it a couple of times a day to just make sure conversations that happen

18:14.800 --> 18:21.840
or it goes in a positive direction, and even, I'm not saying you always have to agree,

18:21.840 --> 18:23.240
like disagreeing is good.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.680
It's how you learn.

18:24.680 --> 18:28.680
It's how you learn to sometimes look at something from a different perspective, and sometimes

18:28.680 --> 18:32.760
you find out that maybe you were wrong or not even necessarily wrong, but there's a

18:32.760 --> 18:34.840
different perspective, and you can agree to disagree.

18:34.840 --> 18:35.840
That's good.

18:35.840 --> 18:42.760
The thing is when those conversations become toxic and when there's somebody that has a...

18:42.760 --> 18:45.720
You can see that they always have something negative to say.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.520
Like they never have something positive.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.520
It's like, no, no, no.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.040
Yeah.

18:53.040 --> 19:00.040
I think that in tech especially this can be difficult because at least from my own personal

19:00.040 --> 19:05.680
experience there's a lot of what I would probably call neurodivergence in tech, and what that

19:05.680 --> 19:12.560
can mean is that there are a lot of different ways of expressing ideas and difficult problems

19:12.560 --> 19:16.160
and concepts and arguments even or discussions.

19:16.160 --> 19:24.440
There are just different individuals that don't mix well together in certain kinds of

19:24.440 --> 19:28.040
conversations even just because of some of those factors that you're never going to be

19:28.040 --> 19:29.600
able to account for all of those things.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.600
It's very difficult to manage.

19:30.600 --> 19:37.440
That's what I found, but then there are also some things that borderline into...

19:37.440 --> 19:38.440
This is with tech generally.

19:38.440 --> 19:45.080
There's some borderline behaviors that have been allowed to flourish in certain tech circles.

19:45.080 --> 19:50.280
We see this with big companies with culture problems usually don't hear talk about it

19:50.280 --> 19:55.880
until it becomes like a Activision Blizzard or an Uber or whatever it is.

19:55.880 --> 20:01.280
You don't hear about this stuff until it bubbles up to the surface, but there is a lot of kind

20:01.280 --> 20:09.160
of just not exactly even bad behavior sometimes, but just not supportive encouraging professional

20:09.160 --> 20:12.820
behavior that happens in these places that is just allowed to happen.

20:12.820 --> 20:16.800
People just start to assume that that's the norm for behavior, so it can be really hard

20:16.800 --> 20:22.960
to foster communities where people are respectful in a way that you're talking about.

20:22.960 --> 20:27.040
I really appreciate that you're doing work focused on that because it's a real tough

20:27.040 --> 20:28.040
problem.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.040
No, it is.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.040
It is.

20:30.040 --> 20:35.000
It's early days, so I think I'm still in the honeymoon phase if you want to call it that.

20:35.000 --> 20:42.400
I hope to be able to drag it out as long as possible, but I'm in a privileged position

20:42.400 --> 20:47.480
in that respect that I do have access to other people that's been in the community space

20:47.480 --> 20:55.600
for quite some time that I can ask for advice because I want to prepare myself for not the

20:55.600 --> 20:56.600
inevitability.

20:56.600 --> 21:02.640
I don't want to be negative about it or pessimistic about it, but should something happen, I want

21:02.640 --> 21:05.040
to be prepared in how to handle it.

21:05.040 --> 21:14.760
I don't want to have to figure it out as it's happening because oftentimes... Oh, there's

21:14.760 --> 21:15.760
you.

21:15.760 --> 21:16.760
Sorry.

21:16.760 --> 21:17.760
No worries.

21:17.760 --> 21:18.760
Was I not muted?

21:18.760 --> 21:19.760
No, you were.

21:19.760 --> 21:20.760
I hope I'm muted.

21:20.760 --> 21:21.760
Okay, good.

21:21.760 --> 21:22.760
I hope I'm muted myself.

21:22.760 --> 21:23.760
Anyway, sorry.

21:23.760 --> 21:24.760
Go ahead.

21:24.760 --> 21:25.760
No, no.

21:25.760 --> 21:26.760
You did.

21:26.760 --> 21:32.000
Because I think often in the moment, you might react in ways that's going to make it worse

21:32.000 --> 21:39.640
rather than better if you're not prepared because it might be heated and so you might

21:39.640 --> 21:45.440
fall into the trap and instead of bringing the temperature down, you might just add fuel

21:45.440 --> 21:47.000
to the fire.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.040
Yeah.

21:48.040 --> 21:53.240
I'm bad at this even my way of communicating when I'm in the middle of working, I can only

21:53.240 --> 21:54.360
do one thing at a time.

21:54.360 --> 21:58.760
I only have a single thread in my processor, just the one, but I can only work on one thing

21:58.760 --> 21:59.760
at a time.

21:59.760 --> 22:04.160
So we live our lives on these messaging-based apps.

22:04.160 --> 22:09.080
So I live on Slack and Discord and Teams and whatever combination of all of those things

22:09.080 --> 22:13.560
I need on my desktop at any given time, but I'm always on, always connected and when I'm

22:13.560 --> 22:19.840
trying to work on something, somebody pops up with a DM and I'm usually blocking because

22:19.840 --> 22:24.280
I'm the one who has all the keys to the AWS and all of that stuff in my organizations

22:24.280 --> 22:25.280
usually.

22:25.280 --> 22:29.380
So if I'm the one blocking, I have to stop what I'm doing to go work on something, which

22:29.380 --> 22:34.040
means that I have to rip myself out of my context and plug into another one and so my

22:34.040 --> 22:38.960
style of conversation can be very like, here's what you need, goodbye.

22:38.960 --> 22:43.880
Sometimes people do not respond and I'm not mean, but even just, I was just thinking about

22:43.880 --> 22:44.880
that the other day.

22:44.880 --> 22:48.400
I'm like, I should probably be a little more intentional about taking a second to think

22:48.400 --> 22:52.680
before I just shoot off whatever message, even if it only needs to be this brief little

22:52.680 --> 22:54.280
informational thing.

22:54.280 --> 22:59.080
I should probably at least just think before I just start typing.

22:59.080 --> 23:03.240
Just think before you start typing is a good principle.

23:03.240 --> 23:07.040
I mean, it's probably a good way to behave on social media too, but yeah, I just go into

23:07.040 --> 23:12.280
this automatic got to get it done mode and sometimes that busyness I think even can contribute

23:12.280 --> 23:18.120
to a tone that can be unapproachable for some people or some styles of workers or thinkers

23:18.120 --> 23:19.680
or whatever it may be.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.160
No, that's for sure.

23:22.160 --> 23:32.400
I think doing many things and working from home, there's so many interruptions that naturally

23:32.400 --> 23:37.560
happen throughout the day and I think those can compound without you even noticing it

23:37.560 --> 23:41.440
and somebody might just DM you at the wrong moment when you've been interrupted multiple

23:41.440 --> 23:44.760
times already and then you're just like, ah.

23:44.760 --> 23:50.400
Now you're just in a bad mood, but it has nothing to do with what that person asked

23:50.400 --> 23:51.400
you.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.400
Yes.

23:52.400 --> 23:55.880
Yeah, I try to manage distractions in a couple of different ways.

23:55.880 --> 24:02.440
I bought this Pomodoro timer.

24:02.440 --> 24:07.680
I did a huge, I kind of took a moment this summer to professionalize and kind of redo

24:07.680 --> 24:12.760
my setup and that's when I formed a company too instead of just working as a freelancer.

24:12.760 --> 24:16.240
So I started doing all of this stuff, but one of the things that I did was try to manage

24:16.240 --> 24:20.600
my time better and so that required a couple of things and one of them was this timer that

24:20.600 --> 24:24.840
makes me work for 25 minutes and take a five minute break and I get a lot more done now

24:24.840 --> 24:32.440
and the other thing was using a cal, I use cal.com as a calendar integration software

24:32.440 --> 24:39.680
so that I have too many calendars on too many projects and I need them all in one place

24:39.680 --> 24:43.760
and my phone is one of those places, but I can't share my phone with people so I had

24:43.760 --> 24:47.640
to make it so that people could schedule things because I was just spending so much time in

24:47.640 --> 24:52.360
my day scheduling things and I'm like, I need to either pay a virtual assistant which I

24:52.360 --> 24:57.160
can't really afford yet or I need to have some sort of calendaring solution.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.920
So that's been another really important thing of the working from home time management part

25:00.920 --> 25:01.920
of my life.

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
Okay.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.200
Those couple of little tools have made a good big bit of difference, so yeah.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.200
Yeah, for sure.

25:07.200 --> 25:15.280
I recently also created like a calendar that's a feed of all my other calendars just so that

25:15.280 --> 25:17.760
the calendar counters.

25:17.760 --> 25:23.400
Because the thing is I ended up, not too regularly thankfully, but it was getting a little bit

25:23.400 --> 25:28.240
out of hand where I would double book myself because I would look at the wrong calendars

25:28.240 --> 25:33.520
and I would forget, oh, dang, that other client also had a thing, oh, now I have to go back

25:33.520 --> 25:37.920
and say, can we do it an hour earlier or an hour later?

25:37.920 --> 25:40.160
And so I was like, no, no, no, let's go and keep it going on.

25:40.160 --> 25:44.520
And also my days were all over the place because I wasn't always sure what the heck I was doing

25:44.520 --> 25:50.240
so I was like, have a calendar that's a view into all the things, because then at least

25:50.240 --> 25:54.080
I can look at that and say, okay, here I have two hours with nothing and I'm going to make

25:54.080 --> 25:57.440
sure I keep those two hours of nothing, because I think that's the other thing.

25:57.440 --> 26:02.200
That's actually been the most, yeah, that's been the most beneficial part, I totally agree

26:02.200 --> 26:03.200
with you.

26:03.200 --> 26:08.520
It's the having access to your own time that comes with having that view, that macro view

26:08.520 --> 26:09.520
of all the calendars.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.880
You have access to your own time in a way that you don't have without it.

26:12.880 --> 26:17.480
So you can be more efficient even in that way, because you know that you've got unscheduled

26:17.480 --> 26:18.480
time.

26:18.480 --> 26:19.480
Yeah.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.040
That's also been very important.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.040
Yeah.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.040
Yeah.

26:23.040 --> 26:27.880
And I can imagine for people changing careers, like going from being, let's say, a lawyer

26:27.880 --> 26:33.080
to being a coder, I think for them those types of time management things are critical too,

26:33.080 --> 26:37.000
because you have this day job that you can't just now quit.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.280
You have to take your time and make sure you're ready before you and you have to get that

26:42.280 --> 26:46.680
job in tech that can support your lifestyle that you've already had.

26:46.680 --> 26:50.520
So I think for them, time management is also like, I'm sure, very tricky.

26:50.520 --> 26:55.680
So hopefully some of this information will help them as well.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.680
Yeah.

26:56.680 --> 27:06.640
Circling back to the social media aspect, I started off being very indie and being very

27:06.640 --> 27:10.640
like running my own blog, all these kinds of things, and I don't know when, but at some

27:10.640 --> 27:17.000
point, I don't know if I just got lazy or what was the story, but I neglected all that

27:17.000 --> 27:20.160
stuff and at some point it hit me.

27:20.160 --> 27:29.160
I was like, my goodness, if these social things go away, a lot of my thinking and thoughts

27:29.160 --> 27:34.920
and stuff that I've written and videos I've made is going to all be gone.

27:34.920 --> 27:42.000
And I then just stepped back and said, wait, wait, wait, wait, how did this happen?

27:42.000 --> 27:44.280
I still don't know, but that's okay.

27:44.280 --> 27:52.440
At least I'm now pivoting back heavily towards the indie webcam camp, because that's what

27:52.440 --> 27:53.440
I love.

27:53.440 --> 27:59.560
I love that aspect of making your own things, owning your content, having a domain where

27:59.560 --> 28:03.640
your stuff lives and you have control over that.

28:03.640 --> 28:08.200
So I am doing more and more and more of that, but I saw what you've done, like I think that

28:08.200 --> 28:12.960
I haven't even thought about doing, and you have created an archive of your Twitter account

28:12.960 --> 28:13.960
on your website.

28:13.960 --> 28:14.960
Yeah.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.520
I wrote a post about how to do it.

28:19.520 --> 28:25.640
I need to do the follow-up because I need to talk about the publish once and just syndicate

28:25.640 --> 28:28.760
everywhere part of that equation.

28:28.760 --> 28:38.600
I got really into Leventy, which is an indie web favorite, I think, static site generator.

28:38.600 --> 28:39.600
It's a really cool tool.

28:39.600 --> 28:44.440
So I got into that because I needed to move my personal blog off of Jekyll.

28:44.440 --> 28:50.680
It was on Jekyll, and development stopped for that, and I just needed a new tool.

28:50.680 --> 28:54.160
When I got into that, I was like, well, this is pretty cool how all of this works.

28:54.160 --> 28:59.600
It just generates the whole website based on a couple of JSON files, is pretty much

28:59.600 --> 29:00.600
what it does.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.600
So it's really cool.

29:01.600 --> 29:05.160
So if you feed it the appropriate data, you can do anything.

29:05.160 --> 29:11.560
So if you can access your own Twitter feed, pull out the tweets from it, you can just

29:11.560 --> 29:16.080
dump them in an archive, and that archive does go up to the point of that publishing

29:16.080 --> 29:17.880
of that post.

29:17.880 --> 29:23.440
I need to pick up with the project and keep going, but yeah, recently, I took a similar

29:23.440 --> 29:24.440
path to you.

29:24.440 --> 29:30.280
I kind of left to go explore all the shiny social apps, and don't get me wrong, I spend

29:30.280 --> 29:33.480
plenty of time on social media.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.480
I love TikTok.

29:34.480 --> 29:35.880
I learned so much from TikTok.

29:35.880 --> 29:39.120
There's so many interesting people on it.

29:39.120 --> 29:43.000
I'm a big Twitter person, and I think being a writer and a tech person, that's just kind

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
of natural.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.720
I spend a lot of time on social media, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about

29:51.720 --> 29:53.640
how bad social media is.

29:53.640 --> 29:58.960
And I'm also spending a lot of time thinking about actually if maybe professionally I want

29:58.960 --> 30:01.240
to start to work on some of this problem.

30:01.240 --> 30:08.320
It's more from a content creation perspective, because I'm really worried, I'm really primarily

30:08.320 --> 30:13.720
concerned with your content, you owning your content, you being able to make money from

30:13.720 --> 30:19.560
your content however you want to, I'm interested in all of this.

30:19.560 --> 30:23.680
So yeah, anyway, I did create a Twitter account, I'm very interested in the Indie Web.

30:23.680 --> 30:30.920
I'm interested in how the current generation of people creating things on the web could

30:30.920 --> 30:37.120
potentially migrate off of these platforms where they get locked in, and onto a syndicated

30:37.120 --> 30:39.080
content model.

30:39.080 --> 30:42.960
So I'm actually doing some work along those lines, and we'll see if it ever materializes

30:42.960 --> 30:43.960
and becomes anything.

30:43.960 --> 30:51.400
But yeah, I'm thinking about it a lot, because I'm a little tired of being beholden to tech

30:51.400 --> 30:56.600
behemoths that come and go and behave badly in the interim.

30:56.600 --> 31:03.640
And I have to work, you know, like my day job, what I'm considering my day job, one

31:03.640 --> 31:08.600
of my big contract projects, I have to interface with meta on a regular basis.

31:08.600 --> 31:15.480
And it's just the most soul sucking, thankless, like it's just impossible to actually even

31:15.480 --> 31:20.920
talk to a human at meta, which is frustrating from a developer experience perspective.

31:20.920 --> 31:26.760
But anyway, so there are a whole lot of reasons why not to lock yourself into any social platform,

31:26.760 --> 31:32.040
any content platform, and I'm a big fan of finding ways to do that.

31:32.040 --> 31:37.960
And then helping just the everyday consumer find ways to do that, which I think is the

31:37.960 --> 31:42.440
big missing link right now, just average Joe Schmoe who doesn't know how to deploy a website,

31:42.440 --> 31:47.600
how do we get those people ownership of their domains, you know, so.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
For sure.

31:48.600 --> 31:55.560
Yeah, it's incredible to me when I sometimes speak to folks that's been even to some of

31:55.560 --> 31:58.680
the bootcamps that's around these days.

31:58.680 --> 32:05.360
And sure, they've learned quite a couple of things, but then they're like, I don't know

32:05.360 --> 32:06.360
how to get this online.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.360
How do you get it online?

32:07.360 --> 32:09.440
And I'm like, wow, they didn't teach you that?

32:09.440 --> 32:12.320
That's like so core to the thing.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.320
What does it help?

32:13.320 --> 32:16.840
You can make all these things, but you can't share it with the world, like, do you just

32:16.840 --> 32:17.840
always have to...

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
There's actually a huge...

32:18.840 --> 32:19.840
Yeah, sorry, go ahead.

32:19.840 --> 32:20.840
No, no, no.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.200
I think it was mostly that.

32:22.200 --> 32:27.160
It's just like, I think it's such a big part of it when you're learning is to make your

32:27.160 --> 32:30.760
own thing, not put it on somebody else's thing.

32:30.760 --> 32:34.560
Yeah, so yeah, go for it.

32:34.560 --> 32:39.960
No, I've noticed, I think there's a big opportunity for documentation in general to do a much

32:39.960 --> 32:45.520
better job here because I spend a significant chunk of my time in any given week reading

32:45.520 --> 32:51.680
developer documentation and almost none of it that I've come across tells you how to

32:51.680 --> 32:54.920
harden a project and deploy for production.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.400
It's just like, here's how you get started.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.040
Good luck.

32:59.040 --> 33:03.640
Nothing tells you how to be ready to have actual users using your thing and in fact,

33:03.640 --> 33:09.000
a lot of them do things that are not best practices for production deployments in their

33:09.000 --> 33:12.320
tutorials because they expect you to understand that it's not for production, but sometimes

33:12.320 --> 33:14.200
when you're learning, you don't expect that.

33:14.200 --> 33:20.960
So yeah, as a self-taught developer, I found that to be pretty frustrating, but it is a

33:20.960 --> 33:21.960
pattern there.

33:21.960 --> 33:27.560
I mean, not having attended a boot camp myself, I can't speak to the quality of them, but

33:27.560 --> 33:31.360
I do know that from some people who have graduated from them, that they have been less useful

33:31.360 --> 33:37.920
than they would have hoped for that reason, that you just don't learn.

33:37.920 --> 33:43.120
You learn a lot of the fundamental, the starting points, but you don't learn how to actually

33:43.120 --> 33:47.720
execute on a vision, which is what everybody wants to do when they go to a coding boot

33:47.720 --> 33:48.720
camp.

33:48.720 --> 33:49.720
Yeah.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.720
Yeah.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.720
Not for sure.

33:51.720 --> 33:57.520
But you mentioned earlier that you are the co-host of a podcast called 16 to 1 with co-host

33:57.520 --> 33:58.520
Katie Day.

33:58.520 --> 34:02.160
Do you want to tell us a little bit more about your podcast?

34:02.160 --> 34:03.160
Sure.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.160
Yeah.

34:04.160 --> 34:09.200
So having mentioned my background in education, you can probably imagine how I ended up here,

34:09.200 --> 34:12.360
but I just am obsessed with podcasts.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.360
I love the medium.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.360
I think it's interesting.

34:14.360 --> 34:19.920
I've heard some of the most fascinating stories of my life through podcasts, and I have a

34:19.920 --> 34:23.440
couple of favorites, and so I listen pretty regularly to those.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.960
And so for a long time, I'd been like, I really should try this.

34:25.960 --> 34:26.960
I love to talk.

34:26.960 --> 34:27.960
I love to think.

34:27.960 --> 34:30.560
I love to, you know, whatever, learn new things.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.560
That was the main thing.

34:31.560 --> 34:37.440
I want to be able to do something that makes me learn something new every, however often.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.320
And I'd been talking about it with my partner for a while, and I was just like, we got to

34:41.320 --> 34:42.320
do this.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.320
We got to do this.

34:43.320 --> 34:48.320
And then we chose to do it right at the beginning of a global pandemic, which was an interesting

34:48.320 --> 34:51.000
choice on our part, let me tell you.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.920
But yeah, about a little more than, I guess, like two and a half years ago now, it's been

34:54.920 --> 34:56.040
a while.

34:56.040 --> 34:59.240
We started recording episodes, and we post every other week.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.160
And it's about education, teaching, and learning.

35:01.160 --> 35:04.760
My partner is a teacher, public school teacher.

35:04.760 --> 35:09.200
And again, like I have an interest in a background in education, although I'm not a classroom

35:09.200 --> 35:10.200
teacher.

35:10.200 --> 35:15.120
But yeah, we talk about education every other week, and I've been doing so for years, and

35:15.120 --> 35:16.120
we have a great time.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.080
And it's a lot of fun.

35:18.080 --> 35:23.040
It's really just something fun to work on together, more than anything.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.200
But yeah, that's what we do.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.760
Yeah, listening to one of the episodes last night is really cool.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.760
I really enjoyed the style of it.

35:30.760 --> 35:31.760
It's very conversational.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.760
Yeah, I really enjoyed it.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.760
I'm always curious.

35:33.760 --> 35:34.760
Yeah, we try to have fun with it.

35:34.760 --> 35:35.760
Yeah, for sure.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.760
It comes through.

35:36.760 --> 35:44.760
Yeah, you're hitting it on the head, the nail on the head.

35:44.760 --> 35:52.560
I'm always curious also about in the actual education, well, I mean, actual, but teaching

35:52.560 --> 35:53.560
at a school.

35:53.560 --> 35:59.320
I'm always curious about the experience of that because it has changed so much.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.040
In some ways, it hasn't changed at all.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.840
In some ways, it's changed a lot.

36:02.840 --> 36:09.240
And I always wonder what is the experience like for teachers now in the school environment

36:09.240 --> 36:15.120
from multiple perspectives, you know, like just working with kids nowadays, like kids,

36:15.120 --> 36:19.880
the way kids react and the kids behave have changed.

36:19.880 --> 36:26.960
Like our, even us as adults, our ability to pay attention has shrunk considerably.

36:26.960 --> 36:31.360
And I think with Jane Z, is it?

36:31.360 --> 36:34.120
I think that's what the almost latest folks are.

36:34.120 --> 36:35.120
I honestly can't keep track of them all.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.120
I can't either.

36:36.120 --> 36:42.840
I was with my daughter the other day, like, what are you, what are your young friends,

36:42.840 --> 36:43.840
what is my sister-in-law?

36:43.840 --> 36:48.760
And I'm trying to figure that out again, but yeah, like, you know, what it's like to work

36:48.760 --> 36:57.600
in that environment where you, you're fighting like these super interactive and super, I

36:57.600 --> 37:02.200
don't know what, I can't remember the words now, but, you know, you're just fighting a

37:02.200 --> 37:09.360
technology that is built to keep your attention and you as a teacher have to somehow get their

37:09.360 --> 37:10.840
attention in the same way.

37:10.840 --> 37:16.160
I think it must be a massive challenge and I'm, you know, I'm really thankful for people

37:16.160 --> 37:21.960
who do that because yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm trying to do that from a developer perspective,

37:21.960 --> 37:26.280
but, you know, for the most part, the people that you interact with there are people that

37:26.280 --> 37:28.560
are self-selected to learn this thing.

37:28.560 --> 37:33.480
Like the tricky thing in schools are oftentimes the kids aren't necessarily interested in

37:33.480 --> 37:38.280
what you want to teach them and that then that's the first hurdle that you have to overcome

37:38.280 --> 37:42.760
is to take a subject and make it interesting.

37:42.760 --> 37:48.320
And I always, I don't always know if teachers are given the tools they need to do that.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.320
And so...

37:49.320 --> 37:52.360
Yeah, that's a good question.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.680
We're actually about to record our next episode we're going to do it this afternoon and it's

37:55.680 --> 37:57.680
going to be on inquiry based learning.

37:57.680 --> 38:03.400
So it's about creating the conditions in which students can become interested and take ownership

38:03.400 --> 38:05.240
over what they are learning.

38:05.240 --> 38:09.960
So that's something that we worry about in our classrooms.

38:09.960 --> 38:17.000
But yeah, I too am in awe of teachers, I say a majority of my friends are teachers for

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
whatever reason.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.120
I'm just around them all the time.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.360
They're everywhere in my life.

38:21.360 --> 38:26.520
And what I hear most often is that, yes, that there are attention issues with technology

38:26.520 --> 38:28.320
and for sure, and discipline issues.

38:28.320 --> 38:37.640
I think the biggest thing though is what makes it difficult is actually the parents of students.

38:37.640 --> 38:41.680
That's what makes it really, really hard to be a teacher is that if you could just go

38:41.680 --> 38:47.240
to your classroom every day and not deal with parents and just teach the kids, then it's

38:47.240 --> 38:48.240
great.

38:48.240 --> 38:54.720
But there's so much managing of bad parent behavior and expectations and complaining

38:54.720 --> 38:58.640
and all kinds of just like helicopter parenting.

38:58.640 --> 39:03.200
But it goes in different ways absent, you know, absent parents, all kinds of you just

39:03.200 --> 39:05.560
you're overcoming so much at that point.

39:05.560 --> 39:09.440
You're working to overcome so many factors that honestly have nothing to do with school.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.240
They're about these people's lives.

39:11.240 --> 39:18.280
So we expect our teachers to do the work of, you know, five, 10 professionals all in one

39:18.280 --> 39:23.440
because we expect them to be psychologists, we expect them to be disciplinarians, we expect

39:23.440 --> 39:28.040
them, you know, some kids come to school and that's the only meal they get during the day.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.380
So like that's the kind of those are the kinds of conditions under which we're working.

39:31.380 --> 39:35.880
So it's not only all the all the stuff that we're normally worried about, you know, following

39:35.880 --> 39:40.880
behind peer nations or whatever it might be about our educational system, which we definitely

39:40.880 --> 39:41.880
are doing.

39:41.880 --> 39:50.480
But but I think what we really need to kind of do is I really think that there's an under

39:50.480 --> 39:54.420
an under commitment of resources to education, you know, formal education in this in this

39:54.420 --> 39:56.520
country at least.

39:56.520 --> 40:00.780
But I think we have a lot of work to do to prioritize education because it's the one

40:00.780 --> 40:08.400
thing that is able to open up doors for people, you know, and I think we should be putting

40:08.400 --> 40:12.520
more money into the educational system and putting more more time into making sure that

40:12.520 --> 40:14.840
it works for all kinds of different learners.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.840
Yeah, for sure.

40:16.840 --> 40:22.560
As somebody from a third world country, I can say it's not just the United States, it's

40:22.560 --> 40:25.280
prevalent everywhere.

40:25.280 --> 40:31.120
We have other problems, compounding, compounding the problem, but it's interesting the parent

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
aspect of it.

40:32.120 --> 40:35.960
It's unfortunate that that is such a big problem, because that's a hard one to solve.

40:35.960 --> 40:39.480
It's very, very hard one to solve.

40:39.480 --> 40:43.720
How do you think like you kind of touched on it earlier when you talked about you read

40:43.720 --> 40:48.840
a lot of developer documentation, like, it doesn't always have the things that you would

40:48.840 --> 40:51.440
expect that you have.

40:51.440 --> 40:55.360
What do you generally think about like education models and stuff like that when it comes to

40:55.360 --> 40:57.920
the tech industry?

40:57.920 --> 41:06.200
Is there anything that you find that's been done really well and then the opposite?

41:06.200 --> 41:07.320
That's a good question.

41:07.320 --> 41:13.160
I haven't come to tech through such a strange circuitous route.

41:13.160 --> 41:19.840
I probably wasn't exposed to a lot of what would be considered this kind of thing in

41:19.840 --> 41:27.320
the tech industry, so I probably can't speak to it with a great degree of certainty.

41:27.320 --> 41:34.200
But I think that the times when I've personally, professionally benefited most have been times

41:34.200 --> 41:44.360
when I've gotten to learn from peers who are patient and helpful and interested in answering

41:44.360 --> 41:45.360
questions.

41:45.360 --> 41:50.320
Even just making yourself available to answer questions can make a difference in somebody's

41:50.320 --> 41:54.720
professional life if you're in a mentorship position.

41:54.720 --> 42:02.800
So I think we have a lot better opportunity for mentorship in tech.

42:02.800 --> 42:10.440
I'm so self-directed as a learner that I've always wanted to know all of this stuff.

42:10.440 --> 42:14.240
So I've never had a problem with motivation like what we were talking about before.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.320
I've always been curious.

42:17.320 --> 42:21.720
So I've never had to be the sort of person who had to slog through something because

42:21.720 --> 42:25.560
I'm choosing to slog through everything I choose.

42:25.560 --> 42:28.480
So yeah, I don't know.

42:28.480 --> 42:31.200
That's a good question.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.720
It's such a broad thing.

42:32.720 --> 42:38.740
I think that higher education in terms of tech, so like formal computer science programs,

42:38.740 --> 42:44.520
I think what I know of higher education is that they lag behind industry in such a way

42:44.520 --> 42:51.160
that the real, I think that the real reason that they exist is to pair you into a professional

42:51.160 --> 42:52.160
network.

42:52.160 --> 42:56.480
I think that's why higher education is, unless you're going to do research or something really

42:56.480 --> 42:57.480
difficult.

42:57.480 --> 43:04.960
I briefly considered going to do a natural language processing program because I was

43:04.960 --> 43:10.000
really super into machine learning and stuff like that.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
Then I was like, you know what?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.520
I don't want to sit, I don't want to do a research.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.080
I don't want to be in academia.

43:15.080 --> 43:18.760
I want to make things and do things.

43:18.760 --> 43:29.100
I think, yeah, anyway, I think it can be hard to find a way in if you're not going to go

43:29.100 --> 43:32.680
one of the accepted routes.

43:32.680 --> 43:37.000
Technology is one route, getting a computer science degree and going directly into a startup

43:37.000 --> 43:39.520
is another route or an established tech company.

43:39.520 --> 43:45.560
But if you're not going to do that, it's very difficult to discern a path.

43:45.560 --> 43:55.200
Then I also think that the big tech companies probably don't do enough to invite a variety

43:55.200 --> 44:00.520
of different learners from a variety of different backgrounds into the fold of technology.

44:00.520 --> 44:04.920
That means that not only are there formal educational problems, but there are also problems

44:04.920 --> 44:08.400
of, hey, do I identify with anyone in this group?

44:08.400 --> 44:14.280
Am I going to be a total outsider here, either socially or economically or whatever nationally,

44:14.280 --> 44:16.680
whatever it is?

44:16.680 --> 44:22.600
A lot of these problems are social and cultural problems more than education or employment

44:22.600 --> 44:23.600
problems, I think.

44:23.600 --> 44:24.600
Yeah, that's really true.

44:24.600 --> 44:30.160
I want to cycle back to that in a second.

44:30.160 --> 44:35.240
What I do think there is a real need for is some kind of mentorship network.

44:35.240 --> 44:42.520
Honestly, I've been in the industry for quite some time, but I do new stuff all the time.

44:42.520 --> 44:47.600
I'm not always sure am I doing this the best way that I could possibly do it.

44:47.600 --> 44:55.880
I recently did a project where I worked with MongoDB, but then I was using this abstracted

44:55.880 --> 45:03.360
layer on top of it, and I would love to ask somebody, can you have a look at this code

45:03.360 --> 45:07.560
and just tell me if it's total garbage or if I at least understand the principles of

45:07.560 --> 45:14.600
this tool that I'm using, because I think I'm doing a decent job and it works, but like

45:14.600 --> 45:19.640
you said, if tomorrow 10,000 people hits this website, is it just going to fall over because

45:19.640 --> 45:23.520
I'm not using it correctly?

45:23.520 --> 45:30.840
I heard somebody speak the other day about using Apollo with GraphQL, and there's a very

45:30.840 --> 45:34.160
good reason you should use Apollo because you can so quickly shoot yourself in the foot

45:34.160 --> 45:37.160
because of the nature of how GraphQL works.

45:37.160 --> 45:42.920
You can actually end up creating 50 queries hitting the database, and where if you use

45:42.920 --> 45:48.880
Apollo, it says, oh, I see what you're trying to do, and it figures it out, and it takes

45:48.880 --> 45:53.480
all of those 50, and it's like, I'm just going to do one query, get this data, and I'm going

45:53.480 --> 45:57.400
to sprinkle it everywhere you need it for you.

45:57.400 --> 46:01.840
If you don't know about that stuff, you're going to just say, hey, it seems to be working

46:01.840 --> 46:07.680
fine, everything is great, and then your client launches the website, and the next morning

46:07.680 --> 46:13.400
you wake up to a bunch of angry voice messages because their website's down.

46:13.400 --> 46:18.640
Or like a $10,000 bill unexpectedly, stuff like that can happen if you have something

46:18.640 --> 46:23.940
based on, yeah, if you have something based on usage, whatever it is, you can get yourself

46:23.940 --> 46:29.040
into scenarios really quickly where you're just unprepared, and I would love to see more

46:29.040 --> 46:33.600
developer documentation that has a kind of two-tier approach where it's like, here's

46:33.600 --> 46:37.640
how you get started, here's how you actually deploy a real production environment here,

46:37.640 --> 46:42.200
because I think that people just expect people to know best practices about that, but I got

46:42.200 --> 46:47.480
to tell you, I've been handed so many projects as a developer where it's like, our last developer

46:47.480 --> 46:52.920
did this mess, can you please un-mess it up, and so nobody knows how to do this stuff.

46:52.920 --> 46:58.080
Obviously, some people do know how to do this, but you don't start out knowing this stuff,

46:58.080 --> 47:03.400
so somebody has to tell you along the line how it should go, so whether that needs to

47:03.400 --> 47:09.680
be on, the onus has to be on developer documentation, I think writers of documentation should do

47:09.680 --> 47:14.720
a better job of doing this kind of, it is a kind of education, so I think that should

47:14.720 --> 47:21.440
happen, but I also think that the keys to those kinds of operations are usually held

47:21.440 --> 47:26.880
by a small number of people at any given company, and so that means that there's not often as

47:26.880 --> 47:32.520
much exposure to those principles of practices, process documents, whatever it might be, there

47:32.520 --> 47:37.960
just aren't as many people who know how to do that stuff in general, so I think we should

47:37.960 --> 47:43.160
try to open up that knowledge more, because even if not everybody is doing it, everybody

47:43.160 --> 47:47.000
should know how to do it, you know, if you're working in tech.

47:47.000 --> 47:54.160
Yeah, I know, for sure, and I think the nice thing about documentation and creating educational

47:54.160 --> 48:00.640
material around this is there's less of a need then to be there in person every time.

48:00.640 --> 48:05.640
I can't remember who it was, but there was somebody that I read about that, like if they've

48:05.640 --> 48:10.240
received an email twice, they post them the same question, they write a blog post about

48:10.240 --> 48:14.320
it, so then the next time they get the same question, they just point people at the blog

48:14.320 --> 48:20.560
post, and I thought that is really a clever way of doing this, because that puts the information

48:20.560 --> 48:27.360
out there, but it frees up your time, and it makes it discoverable by other people that

48:27.360 --> 48:31.920
just search for like, how do I X, and then it's like, yeah, your blog post post pops

48:31.920 --> 48:38.800
up that was an answer to an email, so I think, like I said, a mentoring network would be

48:38.800 --> 48:42.280
nice, but I understand the difficulty of that.

48:42.280 --> 48:46.960
It's like, it's people's time that you're asking for, and in general, people are pressed

48:46.960 --> 48:52.000
for time to start with, so, you know.

48:52.000 --> 48:56.760
The other thing I've struggled with there is that mentoring in the abstract is very,

48:56.760 --> 48:57.960
it's not very appealing to me.

48:57.960 --> 49:01.400
I mean, mentoring with somebody I don't know, I guess is what I should say, that's what

49:01.400 --> 49:06.520
I mean by mentoring in the abstract, so I've always, you know, been very close with my

49:06.520 --> 49:10.360
teachers, just somebody who was curious and interested in education.

49:10.360 --> 49:13.800
I've always been, you know, I've always been close with my own teachers, and so I've benefited

49:13.800 --> 49:16.400
greatly from a couple of mentors along the way.

49:16.400 --> 49:21.360
Now, these people were not in tech, so I really don't, I mean, I have the benefit of working

49:21.360 --> 49:28.720
with my dad pretty closely on one of an ongoing contract project that he's still working on

49:28.720 --> 49:33.920
in his pseudo retirement, so I've kind of gotten to learn a lot from him, but it's a

49:33.920 --> 49:38.880
little bit different when it's family, so I don't have like a, you know, a non-family

49:38.880 --> 49:45.400
tech mentor, I don't think, so it would, and that's just because, for no other reason,

49:45.400 --> 49:48.960
for me, I'm a contract worker, had been a contract worker, and it's difficult to form

49:48.960 --> 49:52.240
a long-term relationship with somebody that you trust when you do that kind of work, and

49:52.240 --> 49:57.080
so I do think there's like, I totally see a need for it.

49:57.080 --> 50:01.720
I don't know how people like me could get into, you know, maybe like a Discord server,

50:01.720 --> 50:06.440
like what you're running would be a good place, because I do spend a lot of time hanging out

50:06.440 --> 50:13.840
in those places, but I need to feel like a mentor is personally invested in me, and that's

50:13.840 --> 50:19.880
what is basically impossible to find, just in the way that I exist professionally on

50:19.880 --> 50:21.440
a day-to-day basis, so.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.440
Yeah.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.200
Yeah, I don't have a solution for it.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.360
I know there's a need.

50:26.360 --> 50:31.560
I'm not entirely 100% sure how to fulfill that need yet.

50:31.560 --> 50:36.320
Maybe it'll happen organically via the Discord server?

50:36.320 --> 50:37.320
I don't know.

50:37.320 --> 50:38.720
I think it's got to be much easier.

50:38.720 --> 50:42.240
It's got to be much easier than just smashing two people together and say, okay, here's

50:42.240 --> 50:47.680
your mentor, which can still happen productively for a lot of people, to be clear, but this

50:47.680 --> 50:52.780
is just, for me, I need to, and that's why actually that Discord approach does appeal

50:52.780 --> 50:59.120
to me, because I can get a sense for people before I DM them and say, hey, can you help

50:59.120 --> 51:03.000
me with this thing, or whatever it is that way, you can get a sense of who's working

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
on what?

51:04.000 --> 51:05.520
Are they going to be interested in your question?

51:05.520 --> 51:07.520
Are you going to feel like you're wasting your time?

51:07.520 --> 51:14.120
That kind of stuff, you can pre-figure out some of that before you dive in to a more

51:14.120 --> 51:15.120
formal relationship.

51:15.120 --> 51:24.400
Yeah, that's very true, and I try and regularly post there encouraging people to ask questions,

51:24.400 --> 51:26.840
because I know people ask questions.

51:26.840 --> 51:30.040
I know that.

51:30.040 --> 51:35.560
Working on an open source project on GitHub and stuff like that, that's scary for people.

51:35.560 --> 51:40.800
That's why I've told people, look, we're all working together on this project, but if you're

51:40.800 --> 51:45.480
all uncomfortable about opening the pull request because you feel like, I'm not sure if my

51:45.480 --> 51:50.800
work's good enough, let us, people that you feel comfortable with, create a Google Doc

51:50.800 --> 51:56.120
or something, or a Notion, thing a Notion, and ask people to go and proofread it there.

51:56.120 --> 52:00.720
If that makes you feel more comfortable, and then you can slowly start dipping your toe

52:00.720 --> 52:06.080
and maybe put your foot in and see how it feels until you feel comfortable, but I think

52:06.080 --> 52:13.120
in the end of the day, you should start building up the confidence to do it and to work in

52:13.120 --> 52:20.000
the open and to be okay with receiving feedback that is maybe not always, you're doing a great

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
job.

52:21.000 --> 52:26.040
Sometimes it's like, thank you for this, but there's this and this and this thing that

52:26.040 --> 52:30.720
you can do, but I understand and I feel for it.

52:30.720 --> 52:36.960
For me, I had to remind myself of that because I've been working in the open for 11 years

52:36.960 --> 52:37.960
or more now.

52:37.960 --> 52:42.400
For me, it's almost like if people talk about that, I'm like, what do you mean it's weird?

52:42.400 --> 52:46.760
Then I'm like, remember, you've been doing this for 11 years.

52:46.760 --> 52:50.740
Think about 11 years back when you had to open that first pull request on this repository

52:50.740 --> 52:52.440
that everybody can see.

52:52.440 --> 52:53.440
How did that feel?

52:53.440 --> 53:00.600
It was like, oh, right, that was kind of scary, and so you have to sometimes just step back

53:00.600 --> 53:06.240
and go back in your own history and remember that it wasn't like it's now.

53:06.240 --> 53:14.480
Now maybe it's just how you work, but it wasn't always like that.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.480
Yeah.

53:15.480 --> 53:22.200
I recently, I was working on a side project and I was like, what am I going to do with

53:22.200 --> 53:23.200
this thing?

53:23.200 --> 53:24.200
Am I going to turn it into something?

53:24.200 --> 53:25.200
It's a little application.

53:25.200 --> 53:30.080
I play Dungeons and Dragons with my friends and I built a little app to manage my character

53:30.080 --> 53:39.120
sheet and I started playing with it and I started forcing myself to use it during sessions,

53:39.120 --> 53:43.600
which was a really fascinating... I mean, it's a similar approach even though it's still

53:43.600 --> 53:44.600
just me.

53:44.600 --> 53:47.600
I did open it up to the group, but I was the only one who used it because everybody else

53:47.600 --> 53:49.440
had paper character sheets.

53:49.440 --> 53:55.800
I wanted mine digitally, so I kind of opened it up before I was really ready and it didn't

53:55.800 --> 53:57.240
go well every single time.

53:57.240 --> 54:03.040
Some of them are, there were some quite spectacular fails of sessions because of it, but I learned

54:03.040 --> 54:09.720
a whole lot about my own app that I was working on building it that way and it actually even

54:09.720 --> 54:12.880
kind of changed the course of how I'm going to actually open source it now.

54:12.880 --> 54:18.320
I'm going to rebuild the thing in Node and do it that way and I'm going to open source

54:18.320 --> 54:19.320
it.

54:19.320 --> 54:23.480
I learned from that experience that putting it out there is really not the worst thing

54:23.480 --> 54:24.480
in the world.

54:24.480 --> 54:25.480
You just got to go for it.

54:25.480 --> 54:26.480
I'm going to see it.

54:26.480 --> 54:28.440
It's going to be really fun.

54:28.440 --> 54:33.680
I've contributed to some open source projects here and there, but I've never actually built

54:33.680 --> 54:39.800
my own, so I'm hoping maybe eventually I'll have a fun little tool for people to use.

54:39.800 --> 54:48.160
Just holding yourself accountable, even publishing that blog post or just deploying that first

54:48.160 --> 54:50.040
staging build, whatever it may be.

54:50.040 --> 54:54.560
You don't have to have something that's perfect and being used by tens of thousands of people.

54:54.560 --> 54:56.760
You can just have a thing that works for you.

54:56.760 --> 55:01.960
That's even one step in the right direction of coming to be able to have a better barometer

55:01.960 --> 55:02.960
for your own success.

55:02.960 --> 55:12.640
Yeah, for sure.

55:12.640 --> 55:17.320
I recently spoke to one of the folks in the MySQL network who's a beginner and I told

55:17.320 --> 55:24.040
him you don't always have to build a thing that is going to be the next Twitter or whatever.

55:24.040 --> 55:29.720
It can just be something that helps you and maybe four years down the line somebody stumbles

55:29.720 --> 55:31.680
upon it and they're like, oh, this is really cool.

55:31.680 --> 55:32.680
I'm going to use it too.

55:32.680 --> 55:35.240
Now you have a second person using it.

55:35.240 --> 55:38.000
If that even never happens, it's okay because you've learned something.

55:38.000 --> 55:42.120
You've made something that's useful to you and that's good.

55:42.120 --> 55:45.400
There's nothing negative about that.

55:45.400 --> 55:48.800
That's like with the blog post principle that you were talking about earlier, if you get

55:48.800 --> 55:53.340
two emails turned into a blog post, I started doing that with myself where if I repeat this

55:53.340 --> 55:59.640
process more than once, turn it into a blog post because that's why I have stuff about

55:59.640 --> 56:05.320
deploying on DigitalOcean on my blog, just random stuff that's so easy, basic walkthrough

56:05.320 --> 56:06.320
tutorial stuff.

56:06.320 --> 56:10.040
But the reason all those exist on my blog is because I had to keep doing them over and

56:10.040 --> 56:13.360
over again and I kept making the same mistakes in the same places and I'm like, why didn't

56:13.360 --> 56:15.800
I write that down the first time?

56:15.800 --> 56:20.560
Now I've got content, yay.

56:20.560 --> 56:21.560
It's good to do that.

56:21.560 --> 56:25.160
I also look at my own blog posts to go set things up sometimes because I'm like, well,

56:25.160 --> 56:26.160
I've already done this once.

56:26.160 --> 56:28.240
Why would I put myself through it again?

56:28.240 --> 56:32.000
Yeah, no, that's definitely, that is very good advice.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.560
I do it less often than I should.

56:34.560 --> 56:39.080
I sometimes make notes and I never go back to the notes and then the next time I hit

56:39.080 --> 56:45.840
the same problem, I'm like, I have fixed this already before, darn it, I have to figure

56:45.840 --> 56:49.440
it out all over again.

56:49.440 --> 56:56.360
Cycling back to your podcast and a topic you touched on related to the cultural aspects

56:56.360 --> 57:01.240
of tech and I think this is in other industries as well, but being in tech, that's probably

57:01.240 --> 57:03.240
what's easiest to speak to.

57:03.240 --> 57:06.960
The episode I listened to from your podcast was the most latest one, which was about women

57:06.960 --> 57:07.960
in STEM.

57:07.960 --> 57:08.960
Yeah.

57:08.960 --> 57:12.960
And I've spoken to a couple of women on the podcast before who it's like getting into

57:12.960 --> 57:19.680
that and had very different experiences based on where they came from culturally.

57:19.680 --> 57:24.720
Also physically, like the one was US native, the other one was from Mexico that recently

57:24.720 --> 57:32.920
moved to the US, but they're still struggling with some aspects of being a non-native American.

57:32.920 --> 57:40.600
And so this is an area for me that I think needs a lot of work, so I was very glad to

57:40.600 --> 57:44.920
see that you've really highlighted and dedicated a whole podcast episode to it.

57:44.920 --> 57:49.800
If you have to share with us, because I would encourage everybody to go listen to that episode

57:49.800 --> 57:56.480
instead of trying to rehash it here, but what I would like is if you can give us the big

57:56.480 --> 58:02.080
takeaways that you've discovered through talking through that topic.

58:02.080 --> 58:03.560
Yeah.

58:03.560 --> 58:12.200
I mean, I think at this point, most people are aware of the problems.

58:12.200 --> 58:19.000
They're the sort of more loud media confronting issues where you get people, sexual assault

58:19.000 --> 58:21.240
in the workplace, stuff like that.

58:21.240 --> 58:25.920
We've got problems there, but then we also just have things like just the sheer numbers,

58:25.920 --> 58:31.440
just representation in tech is still wildly imbalanced.

58:31.440 --> 58:33.280
There's just a very wide gender disparity.

58:33.280 --> 58:37.520
So yeah, that episode is just kind of all about that.

58:37.520 --> 58:41.320
And it mostly exists, it's going to be the fact that we have to start making progress

58:41.320 --> 58:46.320
right now because we're backsliding, we're actually reverting to an even worse state

58:46.320 --> 58:48.400
in terms of these things.

58:48.400 --> 58:53.640
So we need to, and I mean, there's some extent to which some people think this isn't a problem

58:53.640 --> 58:56.520
to be solved because it's one of interests.

58:56.520 --> 59:02.080
By that I mean, well, it's fine because women don't go into tech because they're not interested

59:02.080 --> 59:11.040
in tech, which is if you work with anyone under the age of 20, which through my work

59:11.040 --> 59:16.800
on the podcast and for my partner, I'm exposed to young learners, you know that women are

59:16.800 --> 59:21.360
just as interested, girls are just as interested in technology as anyone else.

59:21.360 --> 59:30.040
So it gets a little, the main takeaway from the episode is really just me asking the question

59:30.040 --> 59:39.080
if half the world is, if 50% of people are women, why are like 19% of software engineers

59:39.080 --> 59:41.080
women?

59:41.080 --> 59:47.760
It just doesn't even, and just asking the question is an affront sometimes to folks.

59:47.760 --> 59:52.800
But for me, it really is just like the question, isn't that weird?

59:52.800 --> 59:58.280
Doesn't that strike people as weird that there's such an imbalance in particular career fields

59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.140
and why, how do we get where we are?

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.560
How do we get past where we are?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.400
That's everything that we tackle in the lesson.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.640
But for me, I think the main focus is just on like, how are we going to start to overturn

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640
some of this?

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640
How are we going to encourage?

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.200
And I think it starts with some of our youngest learners because I think some of the disparities

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:25.440
around gender representation in tech start very, very young because we encourage our

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.040
girls to play with certain toys and dress in certain ways.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.840
And we encourage boys to do different things.

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:39.000
And we definitely don't leave a lot of room for other gender expression in there anywhere

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
either.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:48.440
So there's just like a lot of work to be done to strip all of that out of the space.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.960
And I also think that the other main point that I guess I would take away is that if

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.640
you're lacking representation of anyone in your workplace, you're missing an opportunity

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:04.800
to do better than you're doing because you don't have that unique voice on your

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.280
staff or whatever it is.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.880
If you don't have that, then you're just doing yourself a disservice from a business

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.540
perspective even.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.320
So it just makes business sense to be better about this stuff.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.080
But anyway, yeah, that was the kind of, that was that.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.920
I had gotten particularly frustrated about it because we'd been listening to a podcast

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.320
about For All Mankind, which is a TV show about the space race, kind of re-imagined

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:34.600
history of the space race between USSR and the United States and it's a really fun show.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:38.640
But they had a companion podcast and it was just kind of talking about the history of

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:45.240
involvement of women in NASA and astronaut training programs and how much more difficult

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.960
it was for them just because they were women.

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.880
So that was kind of the inspiration for all of that episode.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:55.560
But yeah, it was a fun conversation, but we still have a ways to go.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.560
Yeah, I know for sure.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:03.440
And I mean, yeah, I totally call bullshit on the whole interest thing, just to be blunt,

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:10.640
because if you want proof that I'm right in this situation, go listen to the episode I

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:17.400
did with Pamela Rodriguez and you'll hear, I'm not just talking towards you like people

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.060
who hear this.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:22.960
If you think it's an interest problem, go listen to that episode.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:30.240
The way she grew up in Mexico, you're not encouraged as a girl to go into technology.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.480
That's not your field, it's something boys do.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.360
That is the message that is clearly being said to them.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:42.600
She was lucky in that her parents encouraged her to go and do that because I believe her

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.960
father was also in tech.

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.400
And so that helped.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.600
But for so many other people, so many other women in Mexico, that is not even an avenue

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.680
they think to explore, not because they're not interested, just because you're told that

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:59.640
it's not something you would be interested in.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:07.840
And one thing that I, a while ago, realized is representation is a big part of it too.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:13.600
If you do not see somebody like yourself in a role, it's hard for you to have something

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:20.120
to strive towards because you can't, I can never find the appropriate word for this,

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.280
but there's no connection there.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.200
It's like you just see a bunch of people that's not you doing the work.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:31.200
And so you think that, oh, maybe it's not meant for me then.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.480
And so it's those bubbles we need to burst and say, no, that's untrue.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:41.920
And we need to lift up people who are trying to change that, give them a voice, give them

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:49.160
a platform to talk and say, hey, I'm like you and I'm doing this, you can do it too.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.520
Because yeah, it's not an interesting, it has nothing to do with that.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.240
It's literally just people don't see themselves in these roles and therefore they don't pursue

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.240
them.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.240
No.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.880
There's a musical, it actually is just closing I think now, called Come From Away, that ran

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.200
on Broadway for a couple of years.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:16.360
And it's about what happened in Gander, Newfoundland on 9-11 when they had to divert all of this

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.840
plane traffic to this tiny little island in the middle of nowhere.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:27.720
So that's the story of the show, but there's a moment in it where there's a character,

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:35.480
she's a pilot and she's singing about how, well, the whole song is just basically about

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:41.920
how she grew up with everyone around her telling her that being a pilot is not for girls.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:48.560
And she evolves into this woman with this flourishing career as a pilot, but did it

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:52.960
despite the fact that she could, despite the fact that everyone around her was telling

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:58.240
her this isn't for you, her peers or colleagues, even her co-workers, her female co-workers

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:04.240
didn't like her, based on a real person, they didn't like her because she was perceived

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:08.240
to be of a higher status than they were as attendants on the flight.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:14.040
So anyway, all this kind of stuff that happens, but that song makes me cry every single time.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.360
My dad is a pilot too.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.600
You can tell that my dad being in tech and my dad being a pilot has a lot to do with

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.160
all of this stuff, but he's kind of the reason I got into all of this stuff.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:27.040
But yeah, there's a line in there about basically, yeah, just about like being a pilot and stuff.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.880
And it makes me cry every single time because I just like to see myself represented.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:39.360
I like to see some strong female characters stand up and say, look at what I did, despite

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:45.240
the fact everyone around me told me I couldn't or never invited me in or, you know, I was

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.720
never given the opportunity, I had to take it for myself.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:57.160
So I really like that, just because it is so important to be able to see that's, yes,

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160
that's me.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160
Yeah.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:03.800
Identifying with peers, I mean, the same thing happens in media, like being able to find

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.720
yourself in media is important for a lot of people.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:15.920
So yeah, it definitely does matter, having examples of other, you know, of peers with

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:19.520
whom you feel like you can share something and identify and grow is very important.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.520
Yeah.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.400
Apparently that's one of the reasons why Fresh Prince of Ballet was such a popular show,

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.920
because it was one of the first ones that was an all-black cast.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:35.400
And the people who played it weren't like poor, like the father was a really successful

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.880
person in law, they had a big house, they were living in like, you know, they had riches

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:43.000
and wealth and all that kind of stuff.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.520
But then also you had this representation from the other side, like the person who came

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:53.680
from, you know, down and out and is now living up here and like there's this difference.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:07:00.840
But the fact that you had those two different economic aspects, but then you had an all-black

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:07.000
cast as well, that made a big connection with a lot of people, and they could see themselves

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.120
and they could also see themselves not being the one that lives in the projects or whatever

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.440
you want to call it, but the one that lives in the big house in Ballet, you know.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:22.680
So that was interesting when I learned about that, I never thought about it that way.

01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:26.720
And when somebody like vocalized it, it was like, oh, goodness gracious, yeah, that makes

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.720
total sense.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:33.480
And for me, it's normal to see white folks living in big houses and being really successful

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.980
and running billion dollar companies.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:42.960
But if you don't see that as somebody that's not me, then it's hard.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.120
Like you feel like you have to be the trailblazer and it's hard to be the first person, right?

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:51.280
It's always hard to be the first one to say, I'm going to change it, I'm going to do this

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.280
thing different.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:59.600
Yeah, it can be too weird to as a woman in tech, because I don't go around thinking of

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.120
my own experience as gendered in tech, I just think of my experience.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:09.000
So I don't, when I'm living in it, I don't look around and think like, oh, well, this

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.160
is happening because I'm a woman or because I'm not a man or whatever it might be.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.640
I don't have those kinds of thoughts.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.760
But the problem is, is that maybe nobody does.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:23.560
We always think of these things in terms of the systemic problems and systemic under representations

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.600
and we tend to big picture these things to the point of almost oblivion because we don't

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:34.240
know what we can do about them anymore when we think of them as big widespread issues

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.240
to confront.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.040
It's almost like a way of abstracting it into nothingness.

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:50.760
So I think that I have had some struggles in my own career just being in such spaces

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:55.880
that are so dominated by a single kind of voice and it's usually a white voice and it's

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.720
usually a male voice and that's just the way it is.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:06.100
It doesn't bother me that that's the default necessarily, but it does bother me when we

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.400
forget that there's a default that we've selected.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:21.640
So it can cause monoculture if nothing else for sure, which is something I'd like to avoid.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.640
Yeah.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.920
Like you said, it's literally like it's bad for business and I mean, I've experienced

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.960
this not in the business sense, but in the community sense.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:37.320
Some of the stuff that we've done, we have people from all over and people whose native

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:44.400
language isn't English has called out some of the stuff that I wrote as like, it's good,

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.640
but like if somebody with my background reads this, I'm going to find this specific area

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:50.640
really complicated.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.520
Like I couldn't understand what you were trying to say here and then they would like, and

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.920
it's amazing how deep that the guy would dive into this and like trying to understand what

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.840
I'm trying to say and I'm like, holy cow.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.920
And then he comes to me and he says like, could we reword it this way and I'm like,

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.920
of course we can.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:13.880
And that makes so much sense that that is just going to make, and now it's more approachable

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.600
for a lot of people.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.600
That's like accessibility.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:21.320
Like you do a thing that makes it accessible to this group of people and hey, guess what

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.320
happens?

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.880
A whole bunch of other people benefit from it as well.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.240
So I think that's the thing, changing the mindset to what you benefit, the benefit you

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.280
derive when you do this thing might be what it takes to change minds.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:41.400
Because I'm not sure, there's an instant hostility toward almost anything you try to say about

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:49.800
this in tech and the reason, I mean, it kind of makes sense because we just don't have,

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.580
we don't have the tools, we don't have the culture, we don't even have the practices

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:59.400
and habits of conversation to be able to have the difficult talks about this stuff that

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.400
we need.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:04.440
So having a really good conversation about a difficult topic, like why are there so many

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:09.600
men in this office and not as many women or something, like if that's the topic, having

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.520
a really difficult conversation about that takes skill and it's not something that can

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.040
just be expected to go well.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:23.720
And I think that that's like, so I think that it can be really difficult because there aren't

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:29.640
a lot of tools that business leaders are given to know how to navigate some of those kinds

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.640
of conversations.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.560
We just kind of assume we have the best idea in the room and that everyone's going to listen

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:43.400
to us and that our CEO word is gold or whatever, but we need to realize that these difficult

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:50.260
kinds of conversations need to happen in a particular moderated civil way and they actually

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:51.260
do need to happen.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:53.960
We can't just say, yeah, we're not going to talk about politics in the workplace, that

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.960
kind of thing.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.000
Like that was a real big trend a couple of years ago, it was like Basecamp and Coinbase,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.880
I think both within like a week of each other, the CEOs were like, no politics in the workplace.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:09.640
And I'm just like, we are political creatures, like we have to exist in the world, which

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.760
means that politics is going to affect our lives, so we have to find a way to acknowledge

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:21.200
difficulties in our workplace and still be productive on the other side of them.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:27.700
So I was just kind of disturbed by that chilling effect, but at the same time, I get why people

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:32.640
are hesitant about having these conversations because they can go so badly.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:39.440
They can go very wrong, that is for sure, they definitely can.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.040
This has been a great conversation, I tend to say that with all of these, it's so great

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.800
to just be able to talk to people about all these things and like hear different perspectives

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.920
and it's always eye-opening, I really enjoy it.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:55.840
I'm glad I started it and I can't remember who it was, but there was some podcast that

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.880
said everybody should have a podcast and I'm starting to agree, it's such a great medium

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:06.320
and to just get to speak with such a wide variety of people and it broadens your perspective,

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.080
it's almost like traveling in a sense.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.560
So yeah, I'm going to go dive into your podcast now that you've been telling me about these

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.800
episodes, it sounds fascinating, I'm going to have to give a listen.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:22.140
Yeah, and I'd love your feedback, like I'm learning as I'm doing this, like I have no

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:26.440
background in podcasting, I just decided one day to start doing it.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.840
I did not either, so you just kind of seems to be the way of it.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.320
Yeah, you just wing it.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320
Start going.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.600
Yeah, for sure.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:41.340
So to close this out, I've kind of two things, maybe one can be just general advice to people

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:50.400
getting starting to learn to code and new to development, any words of wisdom?

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:58.480
Yeah, I think the thing that has helped me most is establishing rituals.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.560
I call them rituals, but it's really just good habits.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:05.400
I mean, if I call them rituals, then I think I'm cool.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.300
So you know, but good habits throughout the day.

01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:13.600
So I used to be a real night owl and I still do stay up late, but I used to think that

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.800
I liked staying up late and sleeping in.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:22.280
But what I actually like is having time in the morning to wake up before I jump in to

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.440
tasks.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:29.200
So I, again, this is back to the kind of scheduling thing, but I go to bed at a reasonable hour

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:34.400
most nights now and I get up almost every day at eight and even though I work from home

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.720
and could get up at noon if I wanted to, but I get up at a set schedule every day.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:46.360
And I take up my dog on a walk at a set schedule every day and establishing those things for

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:53.640
me has been, it's freed me up to think about my work and not to have to think about managing

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.700
my life and schedule, which is kind of infecting some of my workflow.

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:04.800
So I think that, again, especially if you're a solopreneur or a freelancer or you're just

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.400
starting out and you're self-directed, if you have to be in charge of your own time

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:16.680
and also if you struggle with distractions or ADHD or your brain works like mine, coming

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.560
into habits that you can call your own that you actually relish, like I make, I don't

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.000
have been drinking as much coffee, but I used to make my coffee every single morning at

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
the same exact minute.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.400
And I light a little candle when I come into my office every single time so that it smells

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.280
nice and I play music on my sound system every single time.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.980
I get into the workspace and I'm lucky to have a home office too.

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:42.600
It's been important to have a separated work space that isn't part of my life space.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.280
But coming up with these things that are just kind of like things that you do every day

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.720
has been, I think, key to my feeling like I have a more coherent grasp on my own professional

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.120
life these last couple of months, especially as I've been working through some of these

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.120
things.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.980
So that would maybe be the bit of advice that I would give.

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.520
Just come up with your rituals.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.560
You can define them.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.040
But coming up with these things will help you kind of maintain a good sleep schedule,

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:13.840
healthy work-life balance, and just the motivation to keep going.

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:14.840
Yeah.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.840
That's great advice.

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:16.840
Definitely.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:23.680
And you kind of alluded to some things, I guess, now like music and coffee and things

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.680
like that.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.160
What do you do in your downtime?

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.160
Walking the dog?

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.160
Yeah.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.160
Walking the dog, yes.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.160
I have a golden retriever.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.040
I walk the golden retriever, my partner's dog.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.040
I make music.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.840
I'm actually, my office has got a bunch of guitars and keyboards and stuff in here.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.520
But that's mostly just for me.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.380
I don't really publish, I mean, it's on the internet, but I don't, you know, there's some

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.120
things that I want to be just for me.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:51.000
So I do make music.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.200
I like, I mean, I do stuff like 3D printing.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.120
It's any like tinkering or art or just any kind of creative pursuit.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.480
I'll do it.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:07.800
I've got bins and bins full of crafty stuff and electronics and Arduino kits and just

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.240
whatever tinkering is to be done, I'm going to be doing it because I just enjoy it.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:17.040
So yeah, it's a little bit of everything, a little bit of travel, but a lot of music

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:21.120
has always been important in my life and I do like making it.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120
Yeah.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.120
That's great.

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.120
Well, thanks so much, Chelsea.

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.600
This has been a wonderful conversation.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.600
Yeah, thank you.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.840
I'm so glad we made this happen finally.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:35.080
I'm looking forward to your next episode of your podcast, seeing that we kind of like

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.000
just ran into the same topic during this one.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000
We did.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
We did.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.300
