00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,640
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,160
Today we have Isabel joining us.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,160
Welcome, Isabel.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
Thanks for joining.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,280
Yeah, thanks for having me.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,360
It's a pleasure.

8
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,760
I found you on Twitter when I saw a tweet of yours that said, let's open a call and connect.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,240
This is for anyone who wants encouragement when it comes to finding jobs in tech, exploring

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
web dev career.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,920
Is that something you do regularly?

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,440
Yeah, I'm actually fairly active on Twitter.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,040
I'm definitely the type that's just all about community and just kind of uplifting people.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,540
When it comes to coding, it's not easy.

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,040
It's not easy doing it alone.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:55,000
And so I think community is just such an essential part of anybody's kind of coding journey.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So yeah.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,640
That's for sure.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,520
So with that, Mycelium Network, as you know, is part of a community that's exactly set

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,980
up for this to help people who are early-stage web developers.

21
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,200
It's kind of focused on web developers, but it's not exclusive.

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:21,440
We don't tell people who aren't web developers, sorry, you're not welcome.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,160
But also I see the concept of an early-stage web developer, the reason why I use that phrasing

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,360
as opposed to beginner is because everybody's beginners at something at some point.

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,520
And I think the word beginner has kind of maybe even gotten a bit of a bad rap, like

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,100
saying you're a beginner.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,880
So that's why I've adopted the phrase of early-stage developer.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,120
It sounds a bit different because you might actually have coding experience, but you don't

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,280
know JavaScript.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,880
You can do C every day of the week, but JavaScript, you're new to that.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
You're new to HTML.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,080
You need to CSS.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,620
So that's kind of why I adopted that.

34
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:10,280
And also a lot of people like switch careers, like they used to be in enterprise software

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
development.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,920
And it's not even a career switch from not being a coder to being a coder, but from enterprise

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,320
to maybe startup or enterprise to ed tech.

38
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,560
And that's also a change because the thinking, the problem solving, that's different.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,120
So again, you're new at something or a beginner at something.

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
So with all of that in mind, what is your story?

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,960
What is your history?

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,800
I know that you didn't start being a coder, if I understand correctly, that's something

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
that you're transitioning kind of into.

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Yeah.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,440
So for my case, I actually have a background in marketing specifically within the mental

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,080
health field.

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,200
And I was working in marketing within mental health for about two years.

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,440
And I guess basically during COVID, I started to really think about what really interested

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,920
me, what really wanted me to kind of develop more into the career that I was getting into.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,200
And at the time, well, still is, but tech has been like trending, right?

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,640
Especially during like COVID and such.

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,360
And so that definitely gave me like a little interest in it.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,980
And I kind of wanted to see more of how I can get involved and such.

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,480
And so now kind of just moving forward, I work for an ed tech company called Dreambox

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,520
Learning as a marketing operations associate.

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,080
And basically networking and just knowing how to create landing pages with basic HTML

57
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,640
and CSS, that landed me the job in tech.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,040
And so now I'm still kind of in the process of like onboarding and training because I

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,560
literally just got the job of a few weeks ago, but yeah, I'm just kind of helping out

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,800
like our web developers and such develop the company like landing pages and whatnot.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,240
So yeah, that's kind of where I'm at now.

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Awesome.

63
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
That's great.

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Can you tell us a little bit more about Dreambox?

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,640
It sounds really interesting.

66
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
Yeah.

67
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Yeah.

68
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,640
So Dreambox Learning, it's a tech company that focuses on adaptive kind of technology

69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,800
and they really try to make a software or a program curriculum to adapt to a student's

70
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,860
like learning.

71
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,600
And so it's a very personalized approach to a student's like learning.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,120
So it not just helps like the student in their like learning journey, but as well as like

73
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,200
the educator, like they're also able to kind of track and see what the student is missing

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
and such.

75
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,840
So yeah, it's pretty impressive technology that our company's getting involved in.

76
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,840
So yeah.

77
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
Yeah.

78
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
It sounds really interesting.

79
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,440
I know from people that I've spoken to, one of the things they find tricky besides just

80
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,480
finding good content is finding something that fits with their learning style.

81
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,740
So having something that can adapt to your learning style, yeah, that sounds really interesting.

82
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:16,040
So as you're new to tech in some way, shape and form, I know from speaking to previous

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,600
guests and just in general speaking to early stage folk, there are a lot of challenges

84
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,320
when you like walk into this new world.

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,760
So for you, what have been the challenges that you faced?

86
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Yeah.

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,760
So I mean, I can probably go off on the numerous challenges that I'm facing, but I think the

88
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:44,200
common denominator, like the root of it all is just imposter syndrome.

89
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,640
Like I would have these constant thoughts of thinking like, I'm not smart enough, or

90
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,280
I don't know enough math, or I'm a slow learner, or even something like I don't deserve to

91
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
be in tech.

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,600
Like that kind of thinking just really hits hard sometimes.

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,040
And I don't know, maybe it's also just nowadays, I feel like people put tech at such a high

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,840
kind of standard or on some sort of pedestal that you have to be a certain somebody to

95
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
get into tech.

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,000
But honestly, like really anyone can do it.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,080
Anyone can learn how to code.

98
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,600
Like I never imagined myself like being able to learn HTML, CSS, and now JavaScript.

99
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:38,840
Like growing up, my dad, he was a software engineer, and he never actually pushed me

100
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,800
to like look into web development, but I knew that he knew that I had an interest in it.

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,520
And I just remember growing up, he actually bought me this web page builder, and I was

102
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,240
just obsessed with it.

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,880
Like it was just so much fun just like putting together like really simple websites, like,

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,480
I mean, now it probably looks like crap, but like, it was just so much fun, the creative

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,520
process and stuff.

106
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:15,080
But yeah, and I think like, now I'm actually really thankful that he never really pushed

107
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,680
me to like learn how to code like in college or in school or anything like that.

108
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,320
Because for me, this is the first time that I'm actually like wanting to do this myself

109
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,260
and not really having anybody else kind of push me.

110
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,640
Like this is something that I personally want to do.

111
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,560
And it's just cool being able to see other people like me who are just like normal or

112
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,840
non-tech, non-technical kind of people learn to code.

113
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:51,240
So yeah, I'd say imposter syndrome was definitely like the main challenge for me.

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Yeah.

115
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Gotcha.

116
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Yeah.

117
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,720
And I think it's something that doesn't ever really go away.

118
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,520
Because again, I'm going back to this idea of being a beginner at something.

119
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,320
Like I've written JavaScript for a very long time.

120
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,640
But in the recent year and a half or so, I started picking up TypeScript.

121
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,720
And I mean, I feel like a complete newbie again.

122
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Oh, yeah.

123
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,520
It's like typing.

124
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,000
I used to deal with types and stuff like 10 years ago when I did Java and I left that

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
behind and now suddenly like TypeScripts come on the scene and it's quite the thing.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,600
And like especially when you're creating APIs, TypeScript is great because it gives you that

127
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,840
layer of protection where it says to the user of your API, hey, you're trying to pass me

128
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,400
a string, but I'm expecting an integer.

129
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,080
So it protects you from making a mistake even before you've written the code, like when

130
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,260
you try to call it.

131
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
So it's great.

132
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,760
But it's a whole new way of thinking about writing JavaScript.

133
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,280
And even though people say TypeScript is just a superset of JavaScript, it's significantly

134
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,760
different when you really get into it.

135
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,840
If you want to really make use of it properly, there's a lot of differences.

136
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:13,640
But the fact that you now have a job doing some web development and stuff like that obviously

137
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,200
means that you have found some resources that has been useful to you and has been helped

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,160
you to learn.

139
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,880
And I assume, and correct me if I'm wrong, but the fact that you've gone from one industry

140
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,560
to another, you most likely had to do a lot of this by yourself.

141
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,480
It wasn't like going to university and doing a computer science degree.

142
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,880
It's more like buy the bootstraps, do it yourself.

143
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,680
So what resources have you found that you find particularly useful and depend on?

144
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Yeah.

145
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,840
Well, it all started out with the Codecademy.

146
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,440
And I just tried a free trial at first.

147
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:04,320
And it was really nice because on their interface, you're able to see the project and the instructions

148
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,200
and then you also have your space to code and then you're also able to preview, have

149
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
a live preview of what you're coding.

150
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
So all that kind of side by side, it kind of just made everything click.

151
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,640
Like, oh, if I type this out, then this will pop up on the browser or whatever.

152
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:29,880
And so definitely learning by actually coding really, really helped.

153
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,720
And then kind of from there, I went off to different resources like Scrimba.

154
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,640
Scrimba is kind of similar in that sense.

155
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,760
And YouTube, a lot of YouTube tutorials, but I'm very, very cautious around YouTube tutorials

156
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,560
just because you can get so caught up in the, what is that called, quote unquote, tutorial

157
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,560
hell or whatever.

158
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Oh, I forgot about that.

159
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Yeah.

160
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
Yeah.

161
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:04,520
But, I don't know, I feel like as long as you're understanding the concept and the idea

162
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:10,120
of what you're coding and why you're coding it in a certain way, then things will kind

163
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,080
of start to click and then you're actually able to make your own projects and such.

164
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:24,520
And so a lot of ways that I kind of learned was through tutorials and then I would watch

165
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,880
it, re-watch it, watch it again until I understand what's going on.

166
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,280
And then I exit out of the video and I just try to make my own thing, but that's still

167
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,440
revolving around the idea of the concept behind that video that I just watched.

168
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,800
And so in a way, I guess tutorial hell is not really hell, but it can be kind of useful

169
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,080
in some ways.

170
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,320
And there's a lot of ways to kind of apply what you learn with those kinds of resources.

171
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,680
But as I was...

172
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,440
So that was probably last year when I really relied on YouTube, Codecademy, and Scrimba.

173
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,320
And then I just kind of got lost.

174
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,920
I didn't really know where to go after HTML and CSS.

175
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:20,720
And I was looking on LinkedIn and I saw a lot of people were active in the tech community

176
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
on Twitter.

177
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,280
And then that was when I hopped on Twitter just to see what was going on, like, what

178
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,400
do you mean LinkedIn or Twitter's the new LinkedIn or whatever.

179
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:39,960
And so after just kind of exploring different, what is that called, like Twitter communities

180
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:49,920
and such, I connected with my friend Alondra and she is doing the coding bootcamp, the

181
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,000
100 devs bootcamp by Leon.

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,320
And I decided to hop on that too.

183
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:01,920
And it has been great just having more of a structure with my learning.

184
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,440
Like I'm able to kind of see, oh, after CSS, you can go to like JavaScript.

185
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,160
Like it's a lot better than just kind of creating my own kind of roadmap.

186
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,480
And with a bunch of different resources out there, I got really overwhelmed.

187
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,960
And there were so many people saying, oh, use this, oh no, you should listen to so-and-so.

188
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,080
And after just sticking to like one bootcamp, I'm actually able to like see the connections

189
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,640
with everything that I'm learning, you know, because everything is kind of like a building

190
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,540
block from then on.

191
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,840
So yeah, those are definitely the resources that I've used.

192
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:49,600
But I think the one thing is really community and within the bootcamp and on Twitter, that

193
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,920
has been such a huge help.

194
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,720
And I just love how experienced web developers are willing to mentor and have coffee chats

195
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,260
for anybody.

196
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:08,360
And it's just so great knowing that you have people who have you back, you know?

197
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,760
They have like your best interest in mind and want to like push you to be like a good

198
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,760
developer.

199
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,600
And so it's so nice to have this kind of community that's just so, so supportive.

200
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,360
So that's definitely, I think community is like the biggest one.

201
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Yeah.

202
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Yeah.

203
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,440
It's super to hear you say that.

204
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:36,240
I've always been a little weary of the industry not being as friendly and welcoming, especially

205
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,640
when we talk about like the wider, you know, non-standard like white male like me.

206
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,680
I've always wondered like, what is the experience from that perspective?

207
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,560
Because you hear a lot of horror stories, right?

208
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Especially women in tech.

209
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,960
I've heard a lot of stories about where, you know, it's just like even on Twitter, it's

210
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
toxic.

211
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,960
And I've always been like, how do we approach this?

212
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,040
How do we fix this or at least improve it?

213
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,080
So it's great for me to hear that you've had this like really positive experience.

214
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,560
That's really good to hear.

215
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,720
And I think that that leads us nicely into the next question that I had is, like you

216
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,300
said, there's so many resources, so many things, so many possible routes you can take.

217
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,840
So with all of that in mind and all the things that you have learned, like what has been

218
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,560
stuff that you found particularly tricky and stuff that you feel like, this kind of doesn't

219
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
work so well.

220
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,520
It would be nice if we can do X that would have helped me a lot.

221
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:43,200
Honestly, I don't really think there's anything exactly missing, just because everybody just

222
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:51,740
learns differently, hence the various amounts of resources out there, you know, but I honestly

223
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:59,720
think it's important for beginners to just know that if you purchase this course or if

224
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:07,080
you take this class or whatever, it does not guarantee getting a job in tech.

225
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,440
Like there should be a fine print for every kind of class or course out there that says

226
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:22,200
it depends because it really depends on the person and how they learn and how they use

227
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,180
their knowledge to apply that to their projects.

228
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:33,280
It depends on their mental health, like mental health was such a huge thing for me to really

229
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:41,040
navigate when it comes to coding and just the job hunt, like it can be very draining.

230
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,480
And I guess it also depends on their network and how they network and who is in their network

231
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,260
too.

232
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,920
So yeah, I just think that there should be a fine print out there that just says it really

233
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,800
depends because I think it's really misleading when there are ads out there that say, oh,

234
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,200
you'll get a job in tech like right after you complete X, Y, and Z. And you know, it's

235
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,160
just false advertising, like it's just not realistic.

236
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,200
It really depends on the person's process.

237
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
So yeah.

238
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Yeah.

239
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Yeah.

240
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
No, I did.

241
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
There's quite a couple of those going around.

242
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:26,760
There's actually one or two of them that I personally just classify as a scam, where

243
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,440
they advertise this thing where, oh, you can join as an intern in this company sending

244
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
your resume.

245
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Then you do that.

246
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,720
Then they get back to you and say, oh, unfortunately you didn't quite make the cut.

247
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,440
But if you take our 200 euro course and you do really well, it might just be a job for

248
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
you.

249
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,600
I've seen this on some Slack channels and I've said to people, be careful because this

250
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,440
is what happened to a friend of mine and this is how it played out.

251
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,240
So I don't want to demotivate you or anything, but be careful, be weary, because not all

252
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,440
of this is, you know, it's an old adage.

253
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:14,360
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is not true, which is unfortunate, but I think

254
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,040
people need to be careful.

255
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,560
And I think one of the traps people also fall in with tech is you think that it's riches

256
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,440
immediately.

257
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:36,120
And I think while there is the opportunity to make good money, I think the work is hard.

258
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,040
And if you don't enjoy it, then the money's going to dry up the feeling it gives you in

259
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,880
the beginning where it's like you've got some, you know, expendable income and you can buy

260
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,480
some nice stuff, but yeah, the work is hard.

261
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,280
If you don't enjoy it, it's going to become like any other job.

262
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,380
You're going to end up hating it because I think people need to get into coding because

263
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:08,960
you like solving problems and it just happens that you use code to solve those problems.

264
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,760
One of the things you mentioned while you were speaking is being tired from all the

265
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,440
interviews and the whole process around that.

266
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,000
And I know that that's a part of the industry that definitely needs addressing.

267
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,080
I think it's not great, to put it mildly.

268
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,720
It's a combination of HR challenges and then just the interview process itself being stuck

269
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,240
in the 90s or early 2000s or something and it just hasn't evolved.

270
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,320
The industry has changed so much and somehow that has stuck with it.

271
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,600
What do you see as problems?

272
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,160
What makes you nervous or scared about the whole interview process and what would you

273
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,400
like to see changed?

274
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I think when it just comes to the interview process in general, no matter the industry,

275
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:08,080
I guess the process should be like you should really pay attention to the kind of company

276
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,880
that you're interested in.

277
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,720
I feel like a lot of people nowadays, they kind of mass applied a bunch of different

278
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,520
companies and fill out all these forms and expect something.

279
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,840
I don't know, I just feel like that's not the best approach.

280
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:35,520
In my case, I've heard of people that get lucky in that kind of process, but I think

281
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:43,920
it's really important to be very careful with, think about what industry do you want to get

282
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:51,160
into and really pay attention to the people in that industry too and the products in that

283
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
industry.

284
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,760
I feel like that also being easier on the applicant themselves, they're actually able

285
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,640
to focus on one kind of industry, one kind of generic idea of what should be on the resume

286
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,640
and stuff.

287
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,000
I think with just job interviews, when it comes to the technical things, I think there

288
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,040
should be more resources out there for learning how to approach more technical side of code.

289
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
I don't know.

290
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:32,440
I know for myself, I needed to work really hard on remembering the technical words.

291
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,880
I don't know, I found that blogging actually really helps, actually writing out my thinking

292
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,840
process and I really enjoy thinking of ways to simplify complex concepts and I always

293
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,400
have friends read it over to see if it makes sense or something and it's cool just being

294
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:01,320
able to practice that because I think that's also a need, more resources trying to understand

295
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,960
how to approach the technical interview.

296
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,520
I feel like another thing that should change, this is kind of hard because I know recruiters

297
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,320
are just so busy but I think it's just so important to not leave applicants on read

298
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,760
or they just give them a generic email that doesn't give any kind of feedback.

299
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:34,400
Obviously it's such a hard process to solve but I don't know, I just feel like maybe there

300
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,000
should be a templated email of some sort that addresses the kind of projects that they're

301
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,280
expecting or something like that.

302
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:53,120
I've had a few friends that were applying for a few internships and dev jobs and stuff

303
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,360
and they got the same kind of email, literally copy and pasted and I don't know, that made

304
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:07,560
me sad because I'm just thinking like well that doesn't help and so it's hard, it's a

305
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:14,920
very complicated process, I don't really know what could be a good solution for something

306
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:22,560
like that but I just think it's just so sad when applicants just get left on read or they're

307
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,400
just given that templated kind of response that has no feedback whatsoever.

308
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,640
Yeah for sure, no I know, yeah definitely the fact, I feel like at least get back to

309
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,160
people and keep them in the loop that even if it's just this thing to say that we're

310
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,160
still talking to applicants, we haven't made a decision yet, we'll get back to you as soon

311
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,160
as the job's been filled and I think the important thing is also getting back to people when

312
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,760
the job is filled even if they didn't get the job to just let them know.

313
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,440
The job has been filled, unfortunately you were not the candidate we chose but thanks

314
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,000
so much, you know just something being a decent human being I think is what it boils down

315
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
to.

316
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah no exactly.

317
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,880
You know a lot of times things become so processed, not just like food but in real life that the

318
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:22,460
humanity is processed right out of it and the thing is it's not always a reflection

319
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:28,360
of the company unfortunately, like I've worked at companies where the interview process was

320
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,520
pretty terrible but the engineering group and the people in engineering are wonderful

321
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:42,220
people it's just that there is a very very big gap between HR and the people actually

322
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:49,240
doing the work and I don't know how you could solve that that piece because oftentimes you

323
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,040
might get a misperception of the company because of the interactions you have with the recruiting

324
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,680
side of it because oftentimes the recruiting side isn't even part of the company, it's

325
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,320
outsourced and like for them it's about how many people can be placed because we get a

326
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,200
cut of your pay you know for every person that they place so you know there's that all

327
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:20,520
thing to it too, yeah it's a hard problem to solve, related to that I mean some people

328
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,000
might say that you know what I'm just gonna forget the whole interview process and start

329
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,400
my own business and I think that is a question I have for people sometimes is would you rather

330
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,400
be worked for someone or start your own business but I think the bigger question I'm actually

331
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:43,920
trying to get at when I when I ask that is what does success look like to you like you've

332
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:50,400
made this transition right to a new a new you change your career you're in a new industry

333
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,280
when you look at your future what what does success look like?

334
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,800
Well just to address the the first part when it comes to either wanting to start a business

335
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:07,640
or join existing I've definitely thought about starting a business but I don't know it it

336
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:14,280
just sounds so stressful like I think you would definitely need to have like the right

337
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,400
people like on your side and and just I don't know just thinking about like funds and stuff

338
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,640
like that I'm just like yeah I don't want to stress about that kind of stuff right now

339
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:34,240
so I don't know I'm really just drawn to businesses or just companies that have a product that

340
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,920
I trust and believe in and moving beyond that even just the the company culture is like

341
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:48,120
really important to me like I know like Dreambox like like we're super passionate about diversity

342
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,840
and just making sure that people feel heard and like represented I just love everything

343
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,680
that our company's doing to really make sure that that's that's seen you know and so that's

344
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,280
something that I love about like any kind of company like they're they're not afraid

345
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:13,080
to to show off their their diverse and inclusive culture you know and it's it's just so so

346
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:19,520
great and they're not afraid to even answer the the hard stuff that's like going on in

347
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:28,800
the world like I know our company like once a month like we take like an hour or so a

348
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,120
month to just talk about hard stuff that happens in the world like we talked about like Black

349
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,800
Lives Matter like things are happening like in Ukraine like it's just you know there's

350
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,400
just so much that's like happening and it's so important for companies to be involved

351
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,200
in that and so that's yeah so definitely more than just the company's product like definitely

352
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,480
their their culture and their values and I just yeah and I just love the structure of

353
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,520
like an organization like I just find a lot of comfort in that just for myself and yeah

354
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:13,000
I don't know when it comes to success I'd say that success is celebrating even just

355
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,120
the littlest victories that may seem lame or small you know and it's really all about

356
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:28,440
perspective like I I remember when I was just first starting out to learn how to code like

357
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,560
imposter syndrome would just like hit me all the time and I needed to figure out a way

358
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,840
to get out of that like mental state to like keep going you know and I actually kept a

359
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,400
well I still keep a journal that just documents like it's not an in-depth kind of a diary

360
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,840
entry or anything but it's just I basically write out little things that I've accomplished

361
00:28:52,840 --> 00:29:01,480
throughout my life or like my career or my day even and that that helps like every little

362
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,520
step that you take like that's that's such a big deal and even if it feels like you're

363
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,960
going back sometimes but like look at all the stuff that you've like done already you

364
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,000
know it's really all about perspectives so yeah I think just really keeping in mind the

365
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,600
little things that that really helps kind of keep keep me going yeah no for sure for

366
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,520
sure I I kind of started doing that as well some time ago because I I felt that oftentimes

367
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,120
a week or so we'd go by and I would ask myself what did I do in the last week and I was busy

368
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,840
I know I hardly had time for anything but what did I do and so I started jotting them

369
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,000
down and you know using like a Kanban type thing where it's like in progress and then

370
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,240
to done and like at the end of the week you go look at your done column and you're like

371
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:57,640
oh that's all the things I did and then then it feels like ah cool yeah I did that thing

372
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,560
and I did that thing oh that's really neat I think it's cool to go back and celebrate

373
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:07,240
your own accomplishment even if they're small even if it's like I sent an email to this

374
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,120
person that I never thought I would send an email to you know like me was starting this

375
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,520
podcast like I'm constantly reaching out to people that I'm like I hope it's okay and

376
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,400
you have to like imposter syndrome exactly you know you like you have to get past that

377
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,840
and just send the thing or contact them over Twitter or something and hope they're not

378
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:33,520
like oh how dare you slide into my DMs so yeah so it's pretty cool so I think one needs

379
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,880
to do that and I think it's useful like I know another person on the Mycelium Network

380
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:44,080
Discord he actually keeps like a it's amazing the thing he keeps I wish I'll ask him to

381
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,600
share it again but it's like a diary of like his whole learning journey it's like this

382
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,440
whole website and you can read like everything he's learning and the struggles he's finding

383
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,040
and all this kind of stuff it's so interesting and I think it's nice for others to read that

384
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,320
and to see like wow look at this two weeks was really rough like personal events happen

385
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,200
that that made you like not feel like learning and or you just hit a wall because sometimes

386
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,700
that happens like you just hit a wall and it's like I don't think I'll ever be able

387
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,640
to figure this out and then one morning you wake up and whoops you just it just clicks

388
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:29,600
like closure and JavaScript it's one of those topics it's like yeah what closure what variable

389
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:37,160
parent child what and then one day it's like oh that's what closures are that's cool that's

390
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,600
super useful but there's a while where it's just like you're saying words but I don't

391
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:50,280
know if they mean anything I think it's really interesting I think it's good to to keep up

392
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,760
keep perspective about all these things and and talking about that I saw another tweet

393
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,480
of yours where you said you're working on a mini math word problem game how's that curry

394
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:08,440
yeah um it's it's going it's it's a lot of a lot of work I feel like my mind is just

395
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:15,560
so like I'm just I have such a creative mind when it comes to like design like I'm so focused

396
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,640
on CSS and like the styling and then like an hour passes by I'm like oh wait crap I

397
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,040
need to work on the JavaScript part of it too um and so it's yeah it's going really

398
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,240
well like I'm really enjoying um all the different kinds of stuff that I'm learning in in JavaScript

399
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:39,520
but um I really hope to kind of develop this math game for for kids to just kind of practice

400
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,000
their like math and reading comprehension because I think that's well at least for me

401
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,360
I know like growing up when it came to like math word problems like oh my goodness well

402
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,200
first off math was just not my strongest subject but combining both math and reading like that

403
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,440
was that was hard because like you really had to understand the text and understand like

404
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,280
what is the question asking for right and so I hope that that could be a it's definitely

405
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,240
a long term kind of a project but I hope to develop it and eventually make it live and

406
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,920
launch it and have it available for anybody who just uh has like kids or is a kid and

407
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,520
they want to uh just practice that so yeah I mean I guess it kind of goes in line with

408
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,760
like my passion for ed tech so it kind of works out that way too yeah that's perfect

409
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,800
yeah yeah that's super interesting yeah no yeah please keep going and keep people up

410
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:46,220
to date on your twitter as it evolves um thank you so yeah um I have a lot of side projects

411
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,080
and like some of them are just like a lot of people think you're going to start a side

412
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,400
project and especially if it's an open source thing and you're going to do it on get up

413
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,800
and the next day you're going to wake up and there's 100 stars and people uploading you

414
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,480
on twitter and it's just not true like sometimes you're going to build a thing and like it's

415
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,960
crickets but it's fine because you're learning and some and as long as you're building something

416
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,280
that's useful for you it doesn't really matter like if if after 10 years somebody stumbles

417
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,760
upon it and it's like oh my goodness look at this thing and like one other person finds

418
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,640
it useful that's already worth it really um it doesn't always have to be a thing that

419
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,720
like you know turns into the next twitter or the next whatever you know insert successful

420
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:31,400
company here it can sometimes just be something that's fun to do and scratches an itch and

421
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:38,640
helps you learn something new yeah um so if you could recommend one resource be it a book

422
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:45,280
uh online course youtube channel anything like that to early stage learners what would

423
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:53,800
that resource um definitely 100 devs the the boot camp and you don't have to join like

424
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,200
if you if you feel like you're you're good just kind of going on your own like you don't

425
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:06,240
have to join the boot camp but even just listening and watching to uh or watching um the 100

426
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,520
devs like youtube channel like leon is just such a great instructor and he knows how to

427
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:21,220
break things down into little pieces and just simplify things and um like i remember when

428
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:29,480
i came across like his his very first like 100 devs video um the the main thing that

429
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,560
i got out of it was you have to understand how you learn like what is the best way for

430
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,800
you to understand like these kinds of concepts is it by coding is it by reviewing on like

431
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,960
flashcards or like anki cards like you really have to understand how do you learn best and

432
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,560
then you can move forward from that you know and so he really helped um i'm not exactly

433
00:35:53,560 --> 00:36:00,040
like following the boot camp like um in in order just because there's like other things

434
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:07,640
that i also like want to learn but um he i think really like that was just such a good

435
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,280
foundation was oh yeah i need to like step back and figure out yeah how how do i learn

436
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:19,480
like how do i like take information best and i know like for me like this doesn't work

437
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,560
for a lot of people but i love taking notes but the kind of notes that i make are like

438
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,320
flow charts like that is the best way for me to understand like how things like work

439
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,620
like i always just need a visual and then i'll be able to like pick it up and sometimes flashcards

440
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:43,720
works for me i don't know it kind of depends on like what it is but definitely making projects

441
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:52,880
and like um making flow charts really helps solidify uh complex uh concepts so yeah yeah

442
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,840
i think if you're a visual what they term a visual learner i think stuff like flow charts

443
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:04,480
really works well um for me as well i i i can't learn something for the sake of learning it

444
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,960
i have to have a purpose for it like i'm gonna create this like project or i have this client

445
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,760
that i know it's coming up and i'm gonna need to know x to do the work then i jump in and

446
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,480
i learn because it's like okay cool i can learn and i can apply learn and apply and

447
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,520
i think the other side of that is then this learning part and that oh i don't i can't

448
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,060
and then you figure this thing out taking that and writing about it i think the combination

449
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:40,080
of those three things for me personally it's just that's how how it gets stuck up here

450
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:46,880
um i i need to do it very practically like i can't just learn algorithms because maybe

451
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,040
in an interview i'd need to answer that it's like uh that that's draining for me to try

452
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,980
and do that kind of stuff like i don't know i'm not working on a search engine or anything

453
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,020
i i really have not i'm not doing machine learning stuff i don't really have a super

454
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,080
need for algorithms and i'm just gonna learn it because maybe i'll need it in an interview

455
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,400
yeah so for me that that doesn't quite work yeah that's great yeah i've i leon is amazing

456
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,760
i'm i'm gonna i'm trying to get him on the show um to talk with him about the other side

457
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,880
of this journey like being the the mentor the teacher who has to like help people get into

458
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,800
the industry make it a welcoming place and how do you teach and how do we fix some of

459
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:38,400
the the things that you've raised like so hopefully i can get him okay so we're close

460
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,520
to starting to wrap this up so um a new question i have because i think it might be cool is

461
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,560
if you could nominate someone that i should speak to and get on the show who would that

462
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:57,440
be um i feel like definitely my uh dev mentor his name is alan villa uh you can find me

463
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:07,920
on on twitter it's at r alan villa a l l a n v i l l a and um he he's honestly just such

464
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:15,120
a great resource like he's been guiding me in my professional career and um he he like

me to uh use my marketing skills to like get into tech and so he was like you already know

html css you can totally use that within emails you can be like an email developer like obviously

469
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,160
it's not like an actual like dev kind of job but it's definitely a start just knowing a

470
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,400
little bit of html and css like it can definitely give you a step into tech and i feel like

471
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,200
not a lot of people uh realize that so definitely i would say him for sure like he has such

472
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,560
a great life story and um he's he's also just like like a really friendly guy super outgoing

477
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,640
the show but just for you to mention anything you're excited about that you're working on

478
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,560
they want people to know about yeah um i mean i guess i'm currently working on uh two big

479
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,960
projects um there's a there's one that's called a study break reflection app and uh basically

480
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,880
it's the goal of the app is to kind of uh keep a student's uh stress levels in check

481
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,360
and to encourage the student to ask for help like when they get really really stressed

482
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,580
because um i know at least like for me and like my experience like sometimes like stress

483
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:06,360
actually prevents me from like wanting help or from asking for help so i hope like the

484
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:12,080
way i don't know i have a lot of ideas for how this app is gonna uh play out but yeah

485
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,920
that's basically the the gist of it and then um my other one like you said like a like
