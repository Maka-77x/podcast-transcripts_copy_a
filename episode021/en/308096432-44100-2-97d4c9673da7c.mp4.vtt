Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:10.280
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:10.280 --> 00:14.560
Hey, Juan, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:14.560 --> 00:19.440
Hey, thank you for having me, I'm really excited to be here today.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.440
Yeah.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.440
Yeah, I'm looking forward to this conversation.

00:22.440 --> 00:28.200
So on another podcast I run called the Mechanical Ink Podcast, I had a really good conversation

00:28.200 --> 00:33.800
with Abby and Nathalie from GitHub about all things open source and all the cool stuff

00:33.800 --> 00:36.760
that GitHub's doing around that space.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.120
And the education thing came up during our conversation there and they were like, you

00:41.120 --> 00:45.320
should speak to Juan because he runs all this stuff and he's really enthusiastic about this

00:45.320 --> 00:46.320
space.

00:46.320 --> 00:50.560
I was like, that would be great and it would be a perfect fit for the Mycelium Network

00:50.560 --> 00:54.920
Podcast because of what I do as part of this community.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.320
And hey, it happened and here we are.

00:58.320 --> 01:03.380
So I kind of let the cat out of the bag that you are from GitHub.

01:03.380 --> 01:08.440
But without saying anything further, I'm going to give the floor to you and let you introduce

01:08.440 --> 01:09.920
yourself to everybody.

01:09.920 --> 01:15.720
Yeah, we're spoiling the news for our listeners.

01:15.720 --> 01:20.240
So my name is Juan Pablo Flores, I am a Senior Program Manager here at the GitHub Education

01:20.240 --> 01:27.680
Team, where my job is to help students across the world to, you know, get opportunities

01:27.680 --> 01:33.240
on open source, help them to build awesome communities in their campus through the GitHub

01:33.240 --> 01:35.320
Campus Experts Program.

01:35.320 --> 01:41.360
And I also kind of like, we do a little bit of everything, but as a whole, my job, my

01:41.360 --> 01:46.600
main role at GitHub is to support our students on the GitHub Campus Experts Program, which

01:46.600 --> 01:54.400
is our developer program where we teach students how to build or grow welcoming communities

01:54.400 --> 01:59.680
on their campus so that they can help others get prepared before they graduate.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.380
Yeah, that's awesome.

02:02.380 --> 02:06.600
It's definitely something I'm going to dig in a little bit more.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.880
On your Twitter, a website that's a little...

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
Oh no.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.480
...hinted at the moment.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.680
I saw you shared a photo of your first two tattoos.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.700
I'm always curious about, like, I don't have any myself, but I always know that when people

02:23.700 --> 02:27.080
do get these, it's usually, there's usually a story behind it.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.360
So I don't know if you are open to sharing what's behind the story behind your first

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
two.

02:32.360 --> 02:37.120
Yeah, no, it's a whole story because of course, I think the first tattoo is the one you think

02:37.120 --> 02:38.840
about the most.

02:38.840 --> 02:42.600
I'm already thinking about doing like two or three more in the future, right?

02:42.600 --> 02:45.760
But the first one is...

02:45.760 --> 02:54.000
So I'm a very big fan of cybernetics and anime and everything that has to do around that.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.680
And I saw these two very cool storyboards from Ghost in the Shell, the animated version.

03:00.680 --> 03:06.440
And when I saw them the first time, I was like, these drawings are just like absolutely

03:06.440 --> 03:07.440
amazing.

03:07.440 --> 03:16.400
They have really cool details about the head of the shell, let's call it, because that's

03:16.400 --> 03:18.480
how it's called the shell, right?

03:18.480 --> 03:23.640
Which is kind of like this robotic head with a lot of different tubes coming out of it.

03:23.640 --> 03:29.400
And then the next scene or the next storyboard is a brain and the brain has different details

03:29.400 --> 03:34.720
of parts of the brain and some statistics of the brain that look very cool and very

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
futuristic.

03:35.720 --> 03:41.000
And I saw it like, I think a year and a half ago and I was like, I would love to have like

03:41.000 --> 03:45.960
the two of these two storyboards because also like something cool about storyboards is that

03:45.960 --> 03:50.120
it's kind of like this space where they're planning the scenes and they're planning the

03:50.120 --> 03:52.640
movie and what you're going to watch.

03:52.640 --> 03:58.840
So it has a little bit of that behind the scenes of a movie that I really like.

03:58.840 --> 04:04.780
So the two storyboards that I got tattooed, one of them is, it's one of the opening scenes

04:04.780 --> 04:14.200
is when they're kind of like turning their robots on and it's in a part of the movie

04:14.200 --> 04:19.960
very specific where they say like, so this is the shell and it's like the head of the

04:19.960 --> 04:31.040
robot and then they talk about the ghost inside the shell, which is the brain that you can

04:31.040 --> 04:34.280
see and both are very well put together.

04:34.280 --> 04:38.200
It was so hard to find a tattoo artist that was able to draw them because it's like a

04:38.200 --> 04:40.240
lot of really small lines.

04:40.240 --> 04:43.480
So you also need to be very careful in how you maintain it because if you get a ton of

04:43.480 --> 04:50.280
sun or you try to tan, these lines will diffuse into like each other.

04:50.280 --> 04:54.400
So you need to be very careful with that, but fun story.

04:54.400 --> 05:05.280
I got to know the MosFest team and we are building a space called Humans Behind the

05:05.280 --> 05:10.520
Machine, which turns out to be very related to Ghost in a Shell.

05:10.520 --> 05:17.400
So definitely I think there was some inspiration there from attending and just like supporting

05:17.400 --> 05:18.400
MosFest.

05:18.400 --> 05:22.400
Yeah, that's a great story.

05:22.400 --> 05:32.040
I've watched that movie a couple of times and it's intense.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.640
For me personally, I feel like I have to do it in little bits because it's one of those

05:36.640 --> 05:41.800
things like Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those things, every time you read it,

05:41.800 --> 05:46.840
every time you watch it, you pick up new details about it and you kind of start connecting

05:46.840 --> 05:49.560
to the true story behind all of it.

05:49.560 --> 05:54.000
So I really enjoy that, it's something I want to watch again in this new year.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.120
I kind of tend to watch it once a year.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.160
I saw it was really, really cool, but it is very detailed, the tattoo, that's for sure.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.960
It's amazing artwork and amazing artist who did that.

06:04.960 --> 06:05.960
So yeah.

06:05.960 --> 06:06.960
Yeah.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
It's like my precious now.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.960
I need to take care of it until it's hard to be destroyed.

06:10.960 --> 06:11.960
Because now I'm in Seattle, right?

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
Because we don't get a lot of sunlight.

06:12.960 --> 06:20.760
But if I just reach anywhere, I'm just putting a ton of stuff to avoid it getting burned

06:20.760 --> 06:22.720
by the sun.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
That's interesting.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.720
I never knew that about tattoos.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.720
Interesting.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.720
Yeah.

06:27.720 --> 06:33.200
So as you said, you are program manager for the GitHub education.

06:33.200 --> 06:39.880
And I don't know if all of these topics that I'm going to mention falls under the umbrella.

06:39.880 --> 06:44.040
But some of the things that I know about that, to me, in my mind, fits under this umbrella

06:44.040 --> 06:47.080
is, like you said, the campus experts.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.960
That's the one thing that I'm aware of.

06:48.960 --> 06:53.280
And then other things like GitHub skills, which is something relatively new, where you

06:53.280 --> 06:59.280
can kind of create a course material using a combination of a repo and GitHub actions.

06:59.280 --> 07:04.500
And you kind of tie it all together to teach somebody some kind of skill and base that

07:04.500 --> 07:07.680
around some kind of cool automation using actions.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.740
And then there is GitHub classrooms.

07:09.740 --> 07:12.320
Something that I've looked at a couple of times.

07:12.320 --> 07:18.120
But I think I can't quite connect what exactly it all offers.

07:18.120 --> 07:23.260
So my question to you is, can you unpack some of these different things?

07:23.260 --> 07:27.320
What does fall under the umbrella that you care what is outside of it?

07:27.320 --> 07:32.080
And just what does all of these things offer both students, but then also educators?

07:32.080 --> 07:33.080
Yeah.

07:33.080 --> 07:38.400
No, there's a big, there's like different audience when we talk about education, right?

07:38.400 --> 07:42.320
Like we have the students, which are the ones that I work with the most.

07:42.320 --> 07:50.920
We have teachers who is kind of like, I would say the best or the most important influencers

07:50.920 --> 07:56.720
in the world, because they basically teach the technologies that the sports will be starting

07:56.720 --> 07:59.920
to use after they graduate, right?

07:59.920 --> 08:06.020
And what I wanted to make sure, our team does manage the managed GitHub classroom.

08:06.020 --> 08:13.760
So GitHub classroom, look at it as a way that a teacher can improve the way that they manage

08:13.760 --> 08:14.760
their classroom.

08:14.760 --> 08:20.040
So probably when you were a student, or in my case, I remember when I was a student,

08:20.040 --> 08:29.280
when I had to like work with code and do like projects, I would need to take a USB and probably

08:29.280 --> 08:35.760
put my code on a USB and do my stuff and then kind of like working with my team was like

08:35.760 --> 08:39.080
absolutely awful because no one knew GitHub at that time.

08:39.080 --> 08:45.280
I mean, I don't want to say that I'm old though, but it was not one of those things that you

08:45.280 --> 08:51.920
would learn in college to know how to work together, which I think is one of the most

08:51.920 --> 08:57.920
fundamental things that any developer needs to learn is how do we work together with code?

08:57.920 --> 09:03.080
It's very likely that as a developer, you will work in a team, if not with other people

09:03.080 --> 09:06.800
in the internet or in an office.

09:06.800 --> 09:11.480
So learning how to work together is one of those skills that I'm surprised it is not

09:11.480 --> 09:18.880
still kind of part of the curriculum, but that has a fundamental part on any student's

09:18.880 --> 09:25.000
role or future, especially because it's not only about doing code, but it's also about

09:25.000 --> 09:30.680
like communicating and it's also about like how do you avoid or divide work?

09:30.680 --> 09:37.080
So it's much more complex than just like doing a git commit, git push and git pull, right?

09:37.080 --> 09:42.920
So with GitHub Classroom, we try to lower the barrier of entry for both students and

09:42.920 --> 09:48.800
teachers so that a teacher, for example, if you're creating curricula, you can distribute

09:48.800 --> 09:51.240
that curricula through GitHub.

09:51.240 --> 09:56.120
So instead of sharing a link with a link with everyone and then students having to like

09:56.120 --> 10:01.880
work and then it becomes a little bit messy, everyone gets, everyone can click a link and

10:01.880 --> 10:07.960
they form like teams and they have like everything set up to start working on a GitHub repository.

10:07.960 --> 10:13.040
Now this helps the teacher because the teacher can see each of the individual repositories

10:13.040 --> 10:20.360
that students are working on and it also helps the student because they would have everything

10:20.360 --> 10:21.360
that they need.

10:21.360 --> 10:27.440
Like GitHub, while GitHub in specific and GitHub repositories, I like to think about

10:27.440 --> 10:31.520
it as not only as code, but as content as well.

10:31.520 --> 10:38.080
So especially when we talk about learning, GitHub repositories offer great pieces of

10:38.080 --> 10:44.360
content that people is not only pushing code, but they're also pushing documentation and

10:44.360 --> 10:50.760
they're pushing like all of these automations for folks to kind of like learn online and

10:50.760 --> 10:52.760
the same thing happens with GitHub Classroom.

10:52.760 --> 10:56.880
So GitHub Classroom not only offers teachers these control of like, hey, what's kind of

10:56.880 --> 11:02.720
like the current status of the project they can review, even like if you are one of those

11:02.720 --> 11:06.960
teachers that really wants to get into it, you can see, you know, who developed which

11:06.960 --> 11:10.480
part of the code base because you have Git involved.

11:10.480 --> 11:16.640
So you can even see if they really work together or if it was like someone that did everything.

11:16.640 --> 11:24.800
But also for teachers, there's this tool that I forgot the specific name, but they can set

11:24.800 --> 11:31.400
up a few GitHub actions and automations to review their submissions automatically so

11:31.400 --> 11:37.840
that once they have like, well, once all the tests pass, the student is able to merge it

11:37.840 --> 11:42.320
and they get like the scoring for the work that they did.

11:42.320 --> 11:49.120
So in essence, and then teachers can connect these to any of the tools or platforms that

11:49.120 --> 11:54.520
they're using to match their classroom or, you know, these massive tools where you have

11:54.520 --> 11:58.680
like the rooster of students and you match like the grades and everything.

11:58.680 --> 12:05.480
There's also some automations there so that teachers have to do less of the work of managing

12:05.480 --> 12:10.680
the technical side and they can focus more on teaching the classes that they have to.

12:10.680 --> 12:15.240
On the other side, GitHub skills, it's not based on the education team, but definitely

12:15.240 --> 12:19.240
I think is one of the coolest tools that we have because it's kind of like, in some sort

12:19.240 --> 12:23.560
of ways, it's kind of a companion for you to learn.

12:23.560 --> 12:28.600
In this case, or for the most part, how to use them, how to use Git and GitHub.

12:28.600 --> 12:33.760
And it's not only kind of like, here's like these massive like documentation about how

12:33.760 --> 12:39.840
to use Git and GitHub, but as you start doing very small steps, it starts to unlock the

12:39.840 --> 12:41.520
next step and more knowledge.

12:41.520 --> 12:45.720
So that, you know, one of the problems that we've learned is that pitching Git and GitHub

12:45.720 --> 12:46.720
is complex.

12:46.720 --> 12:52.520
Like it's not easy, especially when you are getting started in your career.

12:52.520 --> 12:56.960
People throw at you like not only how to use like Git commands, but how to use a command

12:56.960 --> 13:02.120
line and how to use a terminal and then it's how to use a new platform and everyone tries

13:02.120 --> 13:05.160
to merge everything in a very short amount of time.

13:05.160 --> 13:10.280
And with GitHub skills, you take a little bit of like more of like baby steps and help

13:10.280 --> 13:15.880
folks start to build that learning without overwhelming them with all the knowledge that

13:15.880 --> 13:18.880
they might need to use the platform at its fullest.

13:18.880 --> 13:26.600
And this is something I don't remember the name, but it's the reverse pyramid, the reverse

13:26.600 --> 13:28.680
concept pyramid, something like that.

13:28.680 --> 13:32.640
So it's just a lot of video games where they're teaching you how to use the game.

13:32.640 --> 13:36.800
They don't make you like fight a massive boss or anything, but first it's like this is how

13:36.800 --> 13:40.920
you walk and this is how to jump and this is how you hit the monster.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.720
And then they put you like a boss, right, but unless you're playing like Elden Ring

13:44.720 --> 13:48.400
or something where you suffer playing, right.

13:48.400 --> 13:56.080
The whole idea is to teach you step by step how to do the thing and then with GitHub skills

13:56.080 --> 14:00.160
kind of like evolving and showing you more steps that you can do and more stuff, the

14:00.160 --> 14:06.520
students avoid, well, the students and professional developers have a clear path on how they can

14:06.520 --> 14:07.520
master GitHub.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.520
Yeah.

14:08.520 --> 14:09.520
Yeah.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.520
Well, it's great.

14:11.520 --> 14:18.120
I've used GitHub skills to just as an experiment to just basically see how I would set up a

14:18.120 --> 14:23.160
basic like this is how you would do a pull request and like have a little GitHub skill

14:23.160 --> 14:28.560
that takes you through the steps of forking and then once you fork, you do this and that

14:28.560 --> 14:32.440
and that and then pull request and then it's merged and yeah, you pass to the GitHub skill.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.720
It's really, really useful.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.760
It takes a little bit of getting used to at the beginning, just getting an on-ramp and

14:37.760 --> 14:41.880
understanding how the actions fit together and how the end of the action triggers the

14:41.880 --> 14:44.120
next step and all that kind of stuff.

14:44.120 --> 14:48.440
But once you've done it once, like doing the second one is much easier and the third one

14:48.440 --> 14:49.500
is even easier.

14:49.500 --> 14:54.320
So it's one of those things where it's like your knowledge builds on top of each other

14:54.320 --> 14:59.120
and eventually, you'll just end up creating a whole bunch of little courses and it's great

14:59.120 --> 15:02.040
for a bunch of stuff because you can have automated tests.

15:02.040 --> 15:07.160
So if you did the JavaScript, for example, correctly, the test should all pass.

15:07.160 --> 15:12.360
If they don't, then while you've done something wrong, so you have to go have a look and you

15:12.360 --> 15:19.160
can try and be as clever as possible to try and detect certain common mistakes so that

15:19.160 --> 15:23.200
you can highlight it via comment on the pull request, like this is probably what you've

15:23.200 --> 15:26.720
done wrong because this specific test has failed.

15:26.720 --> 15:32.320
So yeah, I think there's a lot of potential there, but there is like a little bit of a

15:32.320 --> 15:36.400
learning curve, but I think it's fair.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.440
Because the value you get out of it, like the learning, the time you have to take to

15:40.440 --> 15:43.560
learn it is worth that time, I think.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.640
But you brought up something interesting that I was going to ask later, but I might as well

15:46.640 --> 15:47.640
bring it up now.

15:47.640 --> 15:55.120
So I was going to ask you if you have any advice for aspiring developers and young and

15:55.120 --> 16:01.640
old just starting out in their career, but then I wanted to bring in that part where

16:01.640 --> 16:08.760
like exactly like you said, being a maker, a coder, a developer, technical writer, whatever

16:08.760 --> 16:13.760
it is that you're doing in tech, writing code or writing the documentation is only one part

16:13.760 --> 16:14.840
of the job.

16:14.840 --> 16:18.420
A big part of the job is like working with others.

16:18.420 --> 16:24.520
And if you don't understand how to do that well, it can often turn a really great job

16:24.520 --> 16:29.080
into a drag because you're just struggling to work with people.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.720
So I don't know, seeing that you also agree that that is something that's missing from

16:33.720 --> 16:38.680
curricula and stuff like that, what advice do you have for people starting their career?

16:38.680 --> 16:41.160
Like what is the important things to think about?

16:41.160 --> 16:49.200
Yeah, no, especially with the last part, I have to say that I'm going to take my very

16:49.200 --> 16:50.200
personal space.

16:50.200 --> 16:55.900
I remember going to college and there was like this communication class that you need

16:55.900 --> 16:56.900
to take, right?

16:56.900 --> 17:01.680
And everyone saw that class as just like, oh, just like a class they put to fill up

17:01.680 --> 17:02.880
like the curricula, right?

17:02.880 --> 17:06.360
Or something that is not important because people, you know, as a developer, you only

17:06.360 --> 17:07.940
care about the technical side, right?

17:07.940 --> 17:11.960
Like you only want to code and be the perfect developer.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.960
And unfortunately, that sense, I don't know if it happens in other countries.

17:14.960 --> 17:20.600
I know it happens a lot in Mexico, especially in the university that I went to.

17:20.600 --> 17:25.400
But I agree that, you know, one of the biggest challenges that I found, and this is from

17:25.400 --> 17:30.720
my experience working with students from across the world, is that every culture has its

17:30.720 --> 17:36.520
very, you can see culture in the communication style of a person.

17:36.520 --> 17:41.960
And what I mean by that is there are some cultures that are very open to work in public

17:41.960 --> 17:47.000
and share if they are finding a bar or if they are struggling with something.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.800
There are some other cultures that prefer to do that privately because they don't want

17:50.800 --> 17:55.800
to expose themselves or they don't want to get the attention from other people.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.000
There are folks that like very direct communication.

17:59.000 --> 18:04.880
So they won't tell you like a very long, hello, how are you doing?

18:04.880 --> 18:06.640
I hope everything is doing great.

18:06.640 --> 18:11.360
There's like some other cultures that do that because they really value like building a

18:11.360 --> 18:13.040
connection as well.

18:13.040 --> 18:19.320
So communication, I would say, is by far one of the hardest things for any developer, especially

18:19.320 --> 18:21.560
if you work in open source.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.840
Communication is essential so that you don't build on top of someone's full request by

18:24.840 --> 18:30.640
mistake so that you don't take an issue that probably someone else already has taken or

18:30.640 --> 18:36.120
someone or, you know, just like there's so many parts that require communication in our

18:36.120 --> 18:44.160
everyday lives that I think it needs a little bit more.

18:44.160 --> 18:50.280
It should be taken a little bit more seriously, especially in a world where working with folks

18:50.280 --> 18:54.200
from the other side of the world, which is like you and I, we're talking during South

18:54.200 --> 18:55.200
Africa.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.120
I mean Seattle is almost like across the world.

18:59.120 --> 19:05.840
So cultures change a lot and understanding that there are different communication styles,

19:05.840 --> 19:12.120
I would say helps a lot of folks to get more confident of being able to propose things,

19:12.120 --> 19:17.880
but also to understand the behaviors that they see other people are doing.

19:17.880 --> 19:23.240
So definitely communication and understanding different cultures I'd say is one of the most

19:23.240 --> 19:25.120
important skills that you can develop.

19:25.120 --> 19:30.560
And I understand that for some folks, like working in a national or local company is

19:30.560 --> 19:33.640
more than enough and that's okay, but you never know.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.120
Like I would even like within a country, culture is so different.

19:37.120 --> 19:45.200
So I think it's still very important that, you know, we dedicate some time to think or

19:45.200 --> 19:51.080
learn how different communication styles work and that will effectively help us to have

19:51.080 --> 20:00.120
a better work spaces and healthier communication channels with both like the work that we do

20:00.120 --> 20:05.800
professionally, the work that we do personally, and in general like with the communities as

20:05.800 --> 20:07.800
well that we help.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.800
I completely forgot what was the other question though.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.800
I got too much into this.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.800
No, no, no, no, that's perfect.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.800
Yeah.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.000
No, it was just like any, I think you've covered all the bases there.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.760
I think it's good.

20:19.760 --> 20:25.920
I agree with what you've said there with that in mind and talking about communication.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.280
So as an educator, of course, that is key.

20:29.280 --> 20:34.840
Like if you can't communicate well, you're going to have a tough time teaching people

20:34.840 --> 20:41.580
because not only do you have to transfer knowledge, but you have to do it in a way where you can

20:41.580 --> 20:48.160
keep their attention and get their interest, make them excited about the stuff that you're

20:48.160 --> 20:51.800
learning because that's the only way that we retain knowledge is if we're actually enjoying

20:51.800 --> 20:52.800
what we're doing.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.240
So you have to think about how you communicate.

20:56.240 --> 21:01.440
So along those lines, there's so many ways to teach these days.

21:01.440 --> 21:06.160
Like we touched on GitHub classroom, for example, we touched on the automated side of it where

21:06.160 --> 21:14.560
it's you're kind of playing a game with, against or not against, with a machine learning thing

21:14.560 --> 21:15.560
like GitHub skills.

21:15.560 --> 21:19.800
You know, it's like you're there, the human doing your thing, and there's a machine telling

21:19.800 --> 21:23.160
you whether you succeeded or failed and stuff like that.

21:23.160 --> 21:29.360
And then there is another thing that's, I've kind of tried it and then stopped and now

21:29.360 --> 21:34.880
I'm kind of considering going back to it because of a talk I heard at Universe, GitHub Universe.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.560
And interestingly enough, when I was reading up about some of the stuff that you've been

21:38.560 --> 21:42.920
doing that you've done in your past, you were actually involved with a research paper around

21:42.920 --> 21:48.200
this idea of streaming on places like Twitch.

21:48.200 --> 21:54.600
And specifically around audience and streamer participation at the scale of Twitch.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.960
So thinking about that, and I've heard so many people say that, you know, Twitch can

21:58.960 --> 22:02.560
actually be a great place to teach.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.560
What do you think about that?

22:03.560 --> 22:10.280
And what advice and thoughts do you have around this whole idea of using a platform that most

22:10.280 --> 22:14.160
people won't even associate with this idea?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.960
But do you agree that this can be a successful platform?

22:16.960 --> 22:21.800
And if so, do you have any like kind of advice for people that are thinking about doing this?

22:21.800 --> 22:22.960
Yeah.

22:22.960 --> 22:31.000
So Twitch, that research, it was such a great time because it was like before the pandemic.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.520
And I got this awesome opportunity to work with a lab in West Virginia University and

22:37.520 --> 22:44.040
Carnegie Mellon to, they were doing something called audience participation games, which

22:44.040 --> 22:50.320
is basically, you know, when you have an audience like on Twitch, how can you involve your audience

22:50.320 --> 22:54.520
to be part of something that they're watching, like you're consuming content, but at the

22:54.520 --> 23:00.200
same time, you are building that content as well with the host.

23:00.200 --> 23:05.640
And this whole research came out of the Twitch Plays Pokemon stream, which happened like

23:05.640 --> 23:12.600
a few years ago, people had kind of like the control of the character on Pokemon.

23:12.600 --> 23:18.920
I don't remember which version, but basically, like anyone on the audience was able to send

23:18.920 --> 23:23.760
a message in chat and depending on the command that they sent, the character on the video

23:23.760 --> 23:25.880
game would do something.

23:25.880 --> 23:33.800
And it was a bomb of an event to have Twitch Plays Pokemon, like a huge community of developers

23:33.800 --> 23:36.040
came together.

23:36.040 --> 23:40.360
They normally would lose all of their items, so they would like release all the Pokemons

23:40.360 --> 23:45.240
and lose all the Master Balls and all the Pokeballs that they had.

23:45.240 --> 23:49.240
So it was hilarious to see it, but it was really interesting because you can analyze

23:49.240 --> 23:57.440
a lot of like human behavior with these games and, you know, I think there was like this

23:57.440 --> 24:01.560
item that you were not able to throw away in the game.

24:01.560 --> 24:06.640
And the audience took that as kind of like the relic, like the most important item, and

24:06.640 --> 24:11.480
they had like stories about the shell, it was a shell, about the shell and how the shell

24:11.480 --> 24:15.440
represents the game and represents what they were there for.

24:15.440 --> 24:20.000
And it was absolutely incredible how a community was built around that.

24:20.000 --> 24:28.560
I think for Twitch, Twitch has, it's very interesting because I really like Twitch as

24:28.560 --> 24:31.240
a medium of learning.

24:31.240 --> 24:36.160
I think one of the challenges that Twitch has to become a learning platform is that

24:36.160 --> 24:41.600
it's very, very immediate, which means if you lose a show, you lose the content.

24:41.600 --> 24:46.480
So probably you won't be able to watch a replay around Twitch.

24:46.480 --> 24:51.040
And that's what makes other platforms become so successful is that you can, probably if

24:51.040 --> 24:56.920
you miss it, that's okay, but then you can watch the replay or you can watch the recording

24:56.920 --> 24:59.400
afterwards and with Twitch that happens.

24:59.400 --> 25:04.880
But unfortunately, like a lot of those pieces of content gets lost because Twitch has like

25:04.880 --> 25:10.160
these 30 days bot time-lapse.

25:10.160 --> 25:15.240
Some accounts will have that like unlimited though, but the typical thing is like five

25:15.240 --> 25:16.320
to 30 days.

25:16.320 --> 25:24.360
So what we've learned through this research, my job was a lot more on how audiences work

25:24.360 --> 25:26.720
as you grow your channel.

25:26.720 --> 25:34.600
So we define like five different clusters of channels on Twitch, depending on how big

25:34.600 --> 25:38.440
they were and which work and like the relationships that we see.

25:38.440 --> 25:43.160
And it's very interesting because when you're a small channel, you can really create personal

25:43.160 --> 25:45.760
connections between the audience and the host.

25:45.760 --> 25:50.840
But then you have like these stadium, we call them stadium size channels where you have

25:50.840 --> 25:56.280
like 35,000 people watching, which is incredible to think about.

25:56.280 --> 26:03.160
But it becomes like a stadium where it stops being like Juan and I don't know, Fer or whoever

26:03.160 --> 26:04.160
it is.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.520
And it's just like, hey, Chad, how's it going?

26:05.520 --> 26:07.320
So it's like, oh, that's interesting.

26:07.320 --> 26:11.400
When do you become Chad and when are you like someone, right?

26:11.400 --> 26:17.960
So at the end, our thing was much more about how the audience and hosts relate and communicate

26:17.960 --> 26:23.640
during this kind of growth, depending on where your channel was sitting on.

26:23.640 --> 26:27.720
In terms of education, there's some really cool things that I've seen around.

26:27.720 --> 26:33.480
I've seen that folks are, first of all, they feel less pressured to join a live stream,

26:33.480 --> 26:35.300
especially if you have guests.

26:35.300 --> 26:40.080
So if you're a streamer and you're like, hey, do you want to jump in and chat?

26:40.080 --> 26:43.960
People are more likely to jump in and chat than if you tell them like, hey, I'm making

26:43.960 --> 26:47.480
this YouTube video about XYZ, do you want to jump in?

26:47.480 --> 26:51.280
They're like, oh, but I need to prepare because this is going to be recorded and this is going

26:51.280 --> 26:52.280
to be...

26:52.280 --> 26:57.000
So definitely there's a little bit more planning sometimes on YouTube.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.520
And for learning, I think Twitch still has a long way to go.

27:02.520 --> 27:07.320
I think it is a great platform for building great connections and building a community

27:07.320 --> 27:10.120
and bringing everyone together.

27:10.120 --> 27:16.080
A lot of folks are using these learning public type of streams where you probably are learning

27:16.080 --> 27:19.240
some new thing and you stream yourself doing so.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.800
It's really cool because then chat kind of helps you out as well if you're making a mistake,

27:22.800 --> 27:25.680
they will point that out in Twitch chat.

27:25.680 --> 27:29.840
But also it's a little bit, since it's not as formal as probably like the traditional

27:29.840 --> 27:35.020
education system, some folks feel more enticed to participate.

27:35.020 --> 27:40.560
So if something funny happens, people take that opportunity to kind of like jump into

27:40.560 --> 27:43.240
chat and engage.

27:43.240 --> 27:50.760
So I think it allows people to engage a little bit more and really build a community around

27:50.760 --> 27:53.320
learning these type of things.

27:53.320 --> 27:57.200
Now what I see a lot of the streamers are doing is that they do the live stream and

27:57.200 --> 28:02.800
then they take the recording, edit, and then publish that on other platforms so that they

28:02.800 --> 28:04.680
can have this content evergreen.

28:04.680 --> 28:09.400
And I think that's like the best move that you can do because then you feed from the

28:09.400 --> 28:14.120
other platform's audience back to Twitch and then you feed your Twitch audience back to

28:14.120 --> 28:15.120
these other platforms.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.480
So it's kind of like a very good cycle that I've seen has working really good, especially

28:18.480 --> 28:22.000
if you're interested in creating content.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.360
Doing that will really help you to grow your channel really fast.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.320
Yeah, that's good advice.

28:29.320 --> 28:32.160
Yeah, it's interesting.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.080
I'm definitely trying it again.

28:35.080 --> 28:39.960
But I think what you've said here is interesting is maybe I think maybe it's just you have

28:39.960 --> 28:45.360
to rethink based on the platform, what you do, how you do things.

28:45.360 --> 28:52.240
I like this idea where people think like because Twitch is a little ephemeral in a sense, it's

28:52.240 --> 28:53.560
more forgiving.

28:53.560 --> 28:58.120
And so people aren't so concerned about making a blunder on a live stream because they're

28:58.120 --> 29:00.080
like, ah, it's going to go away in a couple of days.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.080
It's fine.

29:01.080 --> 29:06.640
Whereas if it's something that's going to stay around forever, they might be like, I

29:06.640 --> 29:13.240
have to, like you said, be really well prepared for this so that I don't get called out because

29:13.240 --> 29:17.960
I said something that wasn't quite accurate or whatever the case may be.

29:17.960 --> 29:24.640
But then maybe it's a natural evolution of the education system.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.800
I think everybody acknowledges that it's not what it should be.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.520
It's not what it can be.

29:29.520 --> 29:35.400
And maybe this is one of those experiments that a lot of people are trying to see if

29:35.400 --> 29:42.600
maybe this is an evolution of education and this is what the folks of nowadays gravitate

29:42.600 --> 29:43.600
toward.

29:43.600 --> 29:48.120
This is how they'd like to learn by kind of observing and then joining in when they feel

29:48.120 --> 29:50.960
comfortable.

29:50.960 --> 29:57.840
As part of like a lot of the stuff that I do, especially with the MyCNM network, that's

29:57.840 --> 30:04.360
how I try and entice people to get involved is by not forcing them into the public or

30:04.360 --> 30:09.760
saying you have to do this thing, but kind of allowing them to participate on the sidelines

30:09.760 --> 30:16.560
for as long as they need and then starting to slowly maybe speak up about something and

30:16.560 --> 30:19.800
see that, oh, okay, wait, that wasn't that bad.

30:19.800 --> 30:25.400
And then they'll try it again and they'll maybe try it again.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.680
So I think another aspect... Go for it.

30:28.680 --> 30:29.680
Oh, sorry.

30:29.680 --> 30:34.000
I think there's a couple of really cool things that I've noticed.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.800
The first one is, for example, if you see Harvard CS50, it's one of these massive online

30:40.800 --> 30:46.560
courses on getting started with computer science.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
It has both components.

30:47.560 --> 30:52.240
It has a pre-recording component and then a live component to it as well.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.240
That worked really good.

30:53.240 --> 30:59.400
And it's opening Harvard classes to everyone in the world and you can watch them whenever

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
fits your time best.

31:00.400 --> 31:07.440
You don't need to be there 9 a.m. and probably tired of everything that happened the day

31:07.440 --> 31:12.160
before or probably you didn't have a good sleep, you still need to be there.

31:12.160 --> 31:17.620
And that flexibility is welcomed by a lot of folks.

31:17.620 --> 31:23.480
So the first thing is, yes, there's a lot of new content and especially after the last

31:23.480 --> 31:28.560
couple of years, the amount of content that was produced is incredible.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.880
So anyone, you can learn a ton of stuff.

31:31.880 --> 31:36.000
I think the hardest thing now is navigating the content and finding the content that fits

31:36.000 --> 31:41.360
your style the most or that is quality content.

31:41.360 --> 31:46.880
The other side is that there was a lot of experimentation being done during these last

31:46.880 --> 31:54.160
two years and one of the things that I really liked of one of our student events, they organized

31:54.160 --> 31:58.240
a series of workshops on Minecraft.

31:58.240 --> 32:03.960
So they brought their entire community to Minecraft and everyone has their characters

32:03.960 --> 32:08.440
and it's fun because you're playing a video game but they're also learning and teaching

32:08.440 --> 32:12.160
and stuff and people really like that.

32:12.160 --> 32:19.080
And I'm the least creative person in the world but I think the fact that people have the

32:19.080 --> 32:25.040
opportunity to experiment with new mediums and new places and new spaces really helped

32:25.040 --> 32:30.440
out to find out different ways to do the things that we have always done the same way.

32:30.440 --> 32:36.840
Like you're now, if you want to become a software developer, software engineer, computer scientist,

32:36.840 --> 32:44.120
you're not now entirely locked into a classroom but there's so many different ways in which

32:44.120 --> 32:50.540
you can build your career and for example, open source is a great way to gather professional

32:50.540 --> 32:58.200
experience without the hustle of internships and finding a job.

32:58.200 --> 33:04.840
You can start learning some really good professional skills just by jumping into a repository

33:04.840 --> 33:09.440
and asking how can I help to make this repository better, right?

33:09.440 --> 33:12.480
And a lot of that is what we talk, it's not only the communication but also the technical

33:12.480 --> 33:16.200
side that you can learn through open source.

33:16.200 --> 33:23.640
Yeah, and to that point, so Stormy Peters who's also at GitHub now mentioned during

33:23.640 --> 33:30.680
a talk she gave at Universe that by 2030 it's estimated that we'll need around 1.6 million

33:30.680 --> 33:33.480
new developers joining the tech industry.

33:33.480 --> 33:38.440
That's a lot of new developers in what, it's seven years remaining.

33:38.440 --> 33:41.920
So I mean, GitHub is doing a lot of this stuff.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.680
So I'm going to jump between a couple of things here.

33:45.680 --> 33:53.920
So I think the first question I want to ask around that topic is what do you see as the

33:53.920 --> 34:01.840
role of community such as the MyCDM network in helping us get to that 1.6 million?

34:01.840 --> 34:05.600
But also something that I'm very interested in is twofold.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.560
One is using open source as the vehicle.

34:08.560 --> 34:16.080
And two, making diversity, equity and inclusion a natural part of these communities.

34:16.080 --> 34:20.040
It's not this thing that you like tack on at the end to try and like, oh yeah, we have

34:20.040 --> 34:21.320
to be diverse.

34:21.320 --> 34:26.240
It's kind of just naturally, it naturally just happens because of the way you communicate,

34:26.240 --> 34:28.920
maybe the platforms you choose.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.840
I'd just love to hear your thoughts on the whole big topic.

34:32.840 --> 34:37.480
Yeah, no, these are three big topics.

34:37.480 --> 34:45.200
I think, so for us, communities are fundamental at GitHub, especially with GitHub education.

34:45.200 --> 34:53.040
We do a lot of efforts with, for example, campus experts.

34:53.040 --> 34:57.640
It's not only, it's kind of like a very different type of program where you would normally see

34:57.640 --> 35:07.080
these master programs in the industry where it's like, oh yeah, teach X, Y, Z like technologies.

35:07.080 --> 35:11.960
I think with campus experts, what we're trying to do is to be a little bit more in-depth

35:11.960 --> 35:16.440
on the role of communities, especially with student communities.

35:16.440 --> 35:22.520
And a big part of that for us is making sure, first is making sure that the student has

35:22.520 --> 35:28.440
all the tools and resources that they need to be able to build a successful community.

35:28.440 --> 35:33.640
And it's not only, I think one of the biggest mistakes that I've seen is that a lot of folks

35:33.640 --> 35:39.360
open a community because it's the thing that other people are doing.

35:39.360 --> 35:42.920
And instead of that, we wanted to make sure that the students are part of the program,

35:42.920 --> 35:50.640
that they understand that a community is a tool that you can use to get X amount of people

35:50.640 --> 35:54.520
or a certain population to a specific goal.

35:54.520 --> 35:59.920
So instead of thinking of a community as the end goal of like, let's build that, I don't

35:59.920 --> 36:07.200
know, a water community, because we want everyone to know about water, it's like, is a community

36:07.200 --> 36:09.440
the right tool to make sure that that happens?

36:09.440 --> 36:15.400
Or is it just, do you just need like a conference about like water and not a community?

36:15.400 --> 36:23.840
And I think as developers, we try to use communities as the tool that solves every one of our problems.

36:23.840 --> 36:28.400
We want to make sure that people think a little bit more about their communities.

36:28.400 --> 36:33.560
So the first thing that we do is we teach students six different modules.

36:33.560 --> 36:38.760
So they could have core skills to organize or have a community.

36:38.760 --> 36:43.740
So we first take them through a community assessment.

36:43.740 --> 36:47.400
So basically like, what's your community looking like, what are some of the struggles, what's

36:47.400 --> 36:49.280
the mission of the community?

36:49.280 --> 36:53.280
Then we make them go through diversity and inclusion, which is module number two.

36:53.280 --> 37:03.320
And it's essentially thinking of what are some minorities in your city, in your location

37:03.320 --> 37:08.800
that might be feeling left behind or left outside of these events?

37:08.800 --> 37:14.240
And then once they analyze which are these communities, how can you make sure that they

37:14.240 --> 37:17.080
feel welcomed in your community?

37:17.080 --> 37:23.000
And how can you reach out to them or where can you find them so that you can do an intentional

37:23.000 --> 37:27.480
effort to invite them and be part of the events that you're doing?

37:27.480 --> 37:35.240
And I think these two are very core components of the program, because it's not only about,

37:35.240 --> 37:39.320
let's do diversity and inclusion because it's what, as you mentioned, it's the last thing

37:39.320 --> 37:44.160
that we will care about or it's what other people are doing, but rather it's like, who

37:44.160 --> 37:50.160
are some people in my university that probably don't feel welcomed to join these events?

37:50.160 --> 37:52.840
And that's very different in each country.

37:52.840 --> 37:59.900
Every city has a different set of groups that might not fit that they belong in tech.

37:59.900 --> 38:05.200
So it's not something that we as program managers can say, yeah, you need to focus

38:05.200 --> 38:09.200
on this population because they are a minority, but rather we leave that to the student and

38:09.200 --> 38:15.520
we guide them into really understanding who these populations might be so that they can

38:15.520 --> 38:19.960
then start planning how they can reach out to them, invite them, and make sure that they

38:19.960 --> 38:28.120
have a safe space for them to be, to attend or to be or to just join the event.

38:28.120 --> 38:34.760
Then we teach them about how to do workshops, how to do talks, we teach them how to talk

38:34.760 --> 38:39.880
about technical concepts in a much more easier way so that everyone can understand, and then

38:39.880 --> 38:44.920
at the end they do a community proposal, which is basically the culmination of everything

38:44.920 --> 38:52.560
that they have learned in the past five modules, and they make a proposal based on what they

38:52.560 --> 38:57.120
see the community struggles are, where they want the community to be, what are some diversity

38:57.120 --> 39:02.760
and inclusion barriers that they might find, and then they build this proposal of, okay,

39:02.760 --> 39:10.320
if I want to solve issue number one, I need to make a workshop about technology XYZ, or

39:10.320 --> 39:17.800
if I want more people, the most common thing that we see is that students want to bridge

39:17.800 --> 39:23.360
the gap between industry and academia, so it's like, okay, why don't you bring some

39:23.360 --> 39:27.440
people from the industry into your university to have conversations about things that they're

39:27.440 --> 39:33.880
looking for, and some people are like, I want people to be together and get to know each

39:33.880 --> 39:38.520
other because sometimes university can be a little bit isolating, so they organize get

39:38.520 --> 39:45.200
togethers or a hackathon or some fun project, so again, it's not much about using a community

39:45.200 --> 39:50.000
as the end goal, but rather as a tool to bring your community where you want it to be, and

39:50.000 --> 39:55.160
then events serve the same thing, we see all the time of, I want to organize the biggest

39:55.160 --> 39:59.560
hackathon in the world because we want to be the biggest one, and it's like, that's

39:59.560 --> 40:05.320
fun though, but if you can have a thousand people and if they have a terrible experience,

40:05.320 --> 40:11.640
they won't come back, why don't you focus on a smaller event where everyone has an absolutely

40:11.640 --> 40:16.600
crazy, great amount of time so that they come back in the future or they have something

40:16.600 --> 40:23.840
cool to take back with them after the event finishes, so it's a lot of making students

40:23.840 --> 40:30.760
rethink about all of these things that they have heard and making sure that they have

40:30.760 --> 40:36.440
this deep understanding on not only what they're doing, but also how can they take their communities

40:36.440 --> 40:42.320
where they want them to be, and going back to the question because I deviated a ton,

40:42.320 --> 40:47.560
the same thing happens with learning and communities, right, I know, there's, I think for every

40:47.560 --> 40:52.400
city that I've visited, there's someone that wants to get more people into open source,

40:52.400 --> 40:57.960
want to make sure that people have someone that they can reach out to, to learn or grow

40:57.960 --> 41:04.080
their skills, and I think communities can play a really good role there to, you know,

41:04.080 --> 41:08.760
like they understand the context, the local context, and they are going to be better like

41:08.760 --> 41:15.840
teaching new technologies or helping folks to learn about tech and computer science better

41:15.840 --> 41:23.360
than any company from the US will be able to, so communities are kind of like those folks

41:23.360 --> 41:28.080
that, you know, and this is why, for example, the Mozilla developer network is so important,

41:28.080 --> 41:34.440
like you publish the documentation and you publish these amazing like resources for folks,

41:34.440 --> 41:39.200
but they don't work if nobody kind of like teaches them locally or they take them and

41:39.200 --> 41:43.040
they make their own and then they modify it a little bit so that folks in their city are

41:43.040 --> 41:47.520
able to understand it better, so you create this kind of like neutral documentation and

41:47.520 --> 41:51.760
then people can, as kind of like content creators, right, like they take these things that they

41:51.760 --> 41:56.560
see and they make their own, they modify it, they put, and if you're in Mexico, you put

41:56.560 --> 42:01.520
a little bit of salsa to it and then you share that to your community, right, and that's

42:01.520 --> 42:05.560
kind of like the whole goal of communities, like these people understand the struggles

42:05.560 --> 42:10.060
and their community is better than we do and they can create content that is more fitting

42:10.060 --> 42:16.720
to the local context than what we would ever going to do, because if you go or I go to

42:16.720 --> 42:20.920
these communities, I'm probably going to teach the neutral documentation and they'll be

42:20.920 --> 42:25.960
like, okay, that was fun, but like I didn't get it, and it's better if someone that really,

42:25.960 --> 42:30.440
you know, like is building that community and that sense of belonging and that trust

42:30.440 --> 42:37.480
with the community as well, is they have better tools to give these new content to their communities

42:37.480 --> 42:40.880
better than we could ever do.

42:40.880 --> 42:46.120
Now in terms of, I don't know if that makes sense to you, I think.

42:46.120 --> 42:50.760
Yeah, yeah, totally, no, yeah, that's great, yeah.

42:50.760 --> 42:55.240
So I think language plays a big role there, right?

42:55.240 --> 43:00.480
I think you kind of touched on something, I think language plays a big role, like when

43:00.480 --> 43:06.560
you talk about local communities taking content and then making it their own.

43:06.560 --> 43:11.120
I think that one of the big things is just the language, like if it's only available

43:11.120 --> 43:13.960
in English, that in itself might be a barrier.

43:13.960 --> 43:19.880
I think at the beginning, you mentioned that like, get and get up and teaching that is

43:19.880 --> 43:27.880
get up less, but to some extent, but get more specifically is often not taught at the beginning.

43:27.880 --> 43:35.120
And so we've actually seen that in a group that you would think this is not a problem,

43:35.120 --> 43:38.480
it is been the one big stumbling block.

43:38.480 --> 43:45.320
Like for example, at the Write the Docs conference in Portland, just speaking with these technical

43:45.320 --> 43:50.060
writers that that's their job is writing technical content.

43:50.060 --> 43:54.000
When you ask them what is one of the biggest hurdles to contributing to an open source

43:54.000 --> 44:01.360
project, say for example, MDN Web Docs, they would say get, honestly, I'm not sure how

44:01.360 --> 44:05.240
to use get properly, I'm always scared I mess everything up.

44:05.240 --> 44:11.120
I'm not 100% sure how the whole branching and pull request thing works, and that is

44:11.120 --> 44:13.280
why I really don't.

44:13.280 --> 44:21.760
There are of course other factors as well, that's cultural and sometimes it's us maybe

44:21.760 --> 44:26.160
not yet creating as welcoming a space as we think we are.

44:26.160 --> 44:31.760
It's also, but far and away, one of the biggest things is just this core thing.

44:31.760 --> 44:36.720
And I think if you're in that community, you will understand that much better than somebody

44:36.720 --> 44:38.480
looking from the outside.

44:38.480 --> 44:45.080
Because as a coder or something, you might think like, get is just, it's not easy by

44:45.080 --> 44:51.440
no means, but the basic commands you need to be productive aren't that hard.

44:51.440 --> 44:55.920
But that is for you, who uses this every day.

44:55.920 --> 45:00.480
For somebody who that is not core to doing their job, it's a different story.

45:00.480 --> 45:04.840
And I think that plays into the spoken language as well.

45:04.840 --> 45:05.840
Yes.

45:05.840 --> 45:15.440
Language and I think, well, we can nerd about documentation and stuff for ages, but there's

45:15.440 --> 45:23.680
one thing that I met Rachel Lee neighbors, she is absolutely amazing.

45:23.680 --> 45:27.320
We were talking about this because we were going through the same struggle of like, we

45:27.320 --> 45:33.840
want to make sure our documentation is accessible to everyone, but it's so hard because of like

45:33.840 --> 45:38.880
maintaining one piece of documentation in English is hard and then you try to translate

45:38.880 --> 45:44.360
everything into multiple languages, it becomes absolutely unmanageable.

45:44.360 --> 45:46.800
So especially if you have a small team, right?

45:46.800 --> 45:52.200
If you have like a thousand person team, like congratulations and it's great to hear there's

45:52.200 --> 45:57.520
a lot of such teams, but what she mentioned, and I think this makes a ton of sense is that

45:57.520 --> 46:02.040
one of the best tips that she can do, first of all, yes, communities play a good, a massive

46:02.040 --> 46:04.400
role there.

46:04.400 --> 46:12.880
But the second thing is making sure that your documentation is easily translatable by machine,

46:12.880 --> 46:24.160
which means a lot of folks would click the Google Chrome or Firefox auto-translate tool

46:24.160 --> 46:26.960
to get the conditions on their own language.

46:26.960 --> 46:32.240
So making sure that that translation is a quality translation and making your documentation

46:32.240 --> 46:39.480
easily translatable by a machine plays a better role than redoing your whole documentation

46:39.480 --> 46:42.400
in a different language.

46:42.400 --> 46:50.720
So I mean, this is going to be a little bit of not me thinking of me product maintaining,

46:50.720 --> 46:54.240
like thinking of product and documentation as a product is like maintaining languages

46:54.240 --> 47:00.040
is so hard, so expensive, and it really requires a lot of resources.

47:00.040 --> 47:04.880
If you don't have the team to be able to do so, what you can do is to make sure that it

47:04.880 --> 47:11.760
is translatable by a machine and that it makes sense after the machine translates it.

47:11.760 --> 47:19.600
Do you think that is simply avoiding stuff like jargon, avoiding not spelling out acronyms

47:19.600 --> 47:22.280
before you actually start using them?

47:22.280 --> 47:25.000
Do you think those are the kinds of things that you would do?

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
Yeah.

47:26.000 --> 47:31.280
No, Charlie, I think there's, I mean, I'm not an expert in documentation, unfortunately.

47:31.280 --> 47:40.180
I would love to, but there's very small, and I think this has been best practices on documentation

47:40.180 --> 47:45.160
writing for a long time that really helped out the algorithm to make the translation

47:45.160 --> 47:46.160
the best.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.160
Yeah.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.160
Yeah.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.160
Yeah, I know.

47:49.160 --> 47:54.360
I would love to get somebody on here to talk about just, I spoke with Chris Mills, who's

47:54.360 --> 47:58.560
been doing technical writing for a very long time, but it'd be interesting to talk to like

47:58.560 --> 48:03.560
maybe two or three technical writers on one of these episodes and just, because I think

48:03.560 --> 48:08.120
it's so critical to have good documentation, especially for open source projects.

48:08.120 --> 48:13.220
I think some of the most successful open source projects are successful because their documentation

48:13.220 --> 48:14.720
is so good.

48:14.720 --> 48:21.560
I know one of the reasons Vue.js got such a big fan base in China as opposed to React,

48:21.560 --> 48:26.840
which the rest of the world seems to have chosen as their framework of choice, is because

48:26.840 --> 48:33.560
the documentation for Vue is available in Chinese from the get-go because Evan Yeo is

48:33.560 --> 48:38.640
from China originally, and so it was important for him to ensure that that documentation

48:38.640 --> 48:44.800
is available in Chinese because he knows how important that is to people in China.

48:44.800 --> 48:51.400
So it's interesting, and I mean for myself as a developer and a maker, if I want to use

48:51.400 --> 48:57.240
your tool or your framework or your whatever, if your documentation is terrible, then that

48:57.240 --> 49:02.480
is definitely the first place where I'm going to probably see if there's another option

49:02.480 --> 49:03.480
available.

49:03.480 --> 49:06.000
That has good documentation.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.240
So I think it's something that's critical to understand well and then to understand

49:10.240 --> 49:16.120
how to write this, like you said, so it is machine translatable in an efficient manner,

49:16.120 --> 49:19.680
so it doesn't translate in a way that it no longer makes sense.

49:19.680 --> 49:23.560
Like you read it in Spanish and you're like, I'm not exactly sure that's what they were

49:23.560 --> 49:27.960
trying to say here, and you kind of have to switch back to the English version.

49:27.960 --> 49:28.960
That's really good.

49:28.960 --> 49:29.960
That's interesting.

49:29.960 --> 49:31.280
I haven't thought about it from that way.

49:31.280 --> 49:32.280
That's really interesting.

49:32.280 --> 49:37.600
And also, as an open source maintainer, making sure that your documentation is clean and

49:37.600 --> 49:42.320
understandable helps you onboard more folks into using your tools.

49:42.320 --> 49:47.840
So it also ends up benefiting you in terms of how many people are using the tools.

49:47.840 --> 49:52.640
If that's the goal of you, you're creating the project, right?

49:52.640 --> 50:00.560
So I think for a lot of the research that we've done with open source projects, thinking

50:00.560 --> 50:07.800
why is it sometimes hard for some folks to use open source every day is because onboarding

50:07.800 --> 50:13.440
to using these tools sometimes is a little bit hard for some folks that either they're

50:13.440 --> 50:19.760
changing their careers or they're just getting started and they hear about XYZ technology,

50:19.760 --> 50:22.040
but they don't understand the onboarding.

50:22.040 --> 50:26.320
Unfortunately, people leave really fast.

50:26.320 --> 50:32.600
And talking about open source and open source for learning, I think some of the research

50:32.600 --> 50:39.680
that we've done in the past is for us, I think internships are awesome, but unfortunately

50:39.680 --> 50:43.320
not everyone has access to an internship close to them.

50:43.320 --> 50:51.760
Internships are still very geo-located to the US, Canada, and Europe.

50:51.760 --> 50:55.760
There's some in India that are starting, which I think is amazing.

50:55.760 --> 51:00.840
But unfortunately, outside of these programs, it's really hard to get into an internship.

51:00.840 --> 51:05.040
Either you will need to apply to the company and then see if they will offer you a visa

51:05.040 --> 51:10.560
to be able to work during the internship, which that opens a whole different kind of

51:10.560 --> 51:17.720
worms, or you would need to find other ways in which you can gain experience.

51:17.720 --> 51:19.280
At the end, that's the whole goal, right?

51:19.280 --> 51:25.160
We want to make sure that folks get this experience of being out there and learning how things

51:25.160 --> 51:29.880
are done outside of the academia before they graduate, because it's really valuable for

51:29.880 --> 51:31.560
them and for the industry.

51:31.560 --> 51:39.400
At the end, something that we've learned is just by supporting student developers, we

51:39.400 --> 51:42.560
help the whole industry.

51:42.560 --> 51:47.480
We make sure that folks, before they graduate, they come with more experience and with better

51:47.480 --> 51:54.560
tools and better classes, the whole industry levels up as well.

51:54.560 --> 51:58.000
It's in the long term, it's not going to be immediate, but definitely it's worth making

51:58.000 --> 52:03.320
the investment to help the next generation to have everything that they need to be awesome.

52:03.320 --> 52:11.800
On the other side, I think open source is very democratic on the way that it works.

52:11.800 --> 52:18.480
As a student, you're able to go to any open source repository and see what are some of

52:18.480 --> 52:22.360
the issues that are open and explore the technology.

52:22.360 --> 52:27.000
What I really like about open source is that no one asks you for your resume to make a

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
contribution.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.480
It would suck if you would have to be like, oh yeah, here's my experience on these type

52:32.480 --> 52:33.480
of projects.

52:33.480 --> 52:39.200
These are some contributions that I've made, and this is why my pull request should be

52:39.200 --> 52:41.000
the one that you accept.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.760
That would break open source at its core.

52:43.760 --> 52:50.840
Yeah, yeah, well said, well said.

52:50.840 --> 52:55.120
Open source offers a very democratic entrance for everyone to make these contributions and

52:55.120 --> 53:01.680
start gaining more experience with how code is built.

53:01.680 --> 53:05.040
I love the fact that it doesn't matter where you're coming from.

53:05.040 --> 53:11.000
We are trying to find ways in which we can help folks to contribute to these open source

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
projects.

53:12.000 --> 53:18.080
A lot of that as well is some of the challenges is navigating open source, which is how can

53:18.080 --> 53:24.040
I find an issue that I can contribute to, which has been a challenge from eternity.

53:24.040 --> 53:30.960
Not only that, but also how do I make sure... A lot of folks, especially students that

53:30.960 --> 53:36.120
are making their first open source contribution, there's a lot of imposter syndrome involved.

53:36.120 --> 53:44.040
You have the code that probably the maintainer or the contributors are looking for, but the

53:44.040 --> 53:50.120
students really doubt themselves if this is some valuable piece of code.

53:50.120 --> 53:54.280
Another big problem that we've seen is imposter syndrome in the industry, which I think is

53:54.280 --> 53:56.320
kind of like a pandemic.

53:56.320 --> 54:00.840
Everyone has imposter syndrome at some point in their career, but once again, when we talk

54:00.840 --> 54:07.840
about cultures, exposing your work to the world and having an open source maintainer

54:07.840 --> 54:13.040
of a project that probably you're a big fan of review your code, that's challenging if

54:13.040 --> 54:19.240
it's the first time that you're making this contribution.

54:19.240 --> 54:24.560
There's a few challenges, but from what I've seen, more companies are putting attention

54:24.560 --> 54:29.400
into the activities that folks have on GitHub.

54:29.400 --> 54:35.080
So if you're making contributions to open source, that is something that will boost

54:35.080 --> 54:41.440
your resume once you're applying to formal jobs or traditional jobs.

54:41.440 --> 54:47.360
So a lot of folks in a lot of your careers are starting to use GitHub more to verify

54:47.360 --> 54:48.360
your experience.

54:48.360 --> 54:54.280
They check out if you have any projects there.

54:54.280 --> 55:01.040
Even that we've heard weird stories of even if your profile looks like professional-ish,

55:01.040 --> 55:06.360
which that's a very weird thing to say, but I kind of understand what they're meaning.

55:06.360 --> 55:14.240
It's like, oh yeah, you don't have a really good profile picture, but definitely the activity

55:14.240 --> 55:21.040
that you're doing in GitHub can essentially help you out to make your resume or your profile

55:21.040 --> 55:24.920
outstand from others as you apply for jobs afterwards.

55:24.920 --> 55:30.720
I've heard a ton of stories of people getting jobs out of GitHub.

55:30.720 --> 55:38.660
So people that become continuous contributors or recurring contributors to open source projects,

55:38.660 --> 55:42.320
they get visibility from other developers.

55:42.320 --> 55:47.840
I mean, if I can get someone that is contributing a lot to an open source project that I'm building

55:47.840 --> 55:55.480
my technology from, I would totally send them a message of, hey, are you looking for a job?

55:55.480 --> 56:00.480
I have full transparency of how you work, and I think this is extremely valuable.

56:00.480 --> 56:05.520
So, I really hope, and it's not a hope, I think it's something that we're naturally

56:05.520 --> 56:11.000
moving towards too, that first of all, open source offers a democratic way of getting

56:11.000 --> 56:15.320
professional experience in, I would say, its fullest component.

56:15.320 --> 56:21.040
Second of all, it can help you get a job, especially if you are getting started in tech

56:21.040 --> 56:27.280
or if you change your careers, making open source contributions and being active in a

56:27.280 --> 56:31.760
way that might bump your resume or your application to a job.

56:31.760 --> 56:35.520
And third, it's a great way to meet really cool people that are doing really cool stuff.

56:35.520 --> 56:41.280
And you never know, probably one of them can get you to your next job or your first job

56:41.280 --> 56:42.280
as well.

56:42.280 --> 56:43.280
Yeah, that's great.

56:43.280 --> 56:44.280
100% agree.

56:44.280 --> 56:48.920
Yeah, you've answered all my questions and then some.

56:48.920 --> 56:49.920
So that's great.

56:49.920 --> 56:52.120
I love that.

56:52.120 --> 56:55.640
So I have basically two questions left.

56:55.640 --> 57:01.160
And the one is, so we've talked a lot about students and all the opportunities there are

57:01.160 --> 57:03.120
and all the things that getups offer.

57:03.120 --> 57:08.240
But as you've worked with all these students and you've seen what works and what doesn't

57:08.240 --> 57:14.960
work and some new trends, maybe that's emerging or anything, is there anything specific advice

57:14.960 --> 57:17.240
you have for educators?

57:17.240 --> 57:21.680
Like are there some things that you've seen that, you know, if you incorporate this into

57:21.680 --> 57:28.240
how you teach, it really works well with students and these are things that's kind of like that

57:28.240 --> 57:30.720
doesn't kind of gel with students?

57:30.720 --> 57:33.120
Yeah, no, totally.

57:33.120 --> 57:40.560
I think educators in particular are, we put a lot of responsibility on their hands.

57:40.560 --> 57:45.880
Like they don't only have to create a lot of the curricula, they also need to, I would

57:45.880 --> 57:47.640
say it's kind of like a performance art, right?

57:47.640 --> 57:50.600
Like you need to engage people and keep them excited about what they're learning.

57:50.600 --> 57:52.920
But also you need to teach them.

57:52.920 --> 57:58.040
So it's like, it's not only kind of like watching a TV show on whatever platform, but it's also

57:58.040 --> 58:03.000
how do you make sure that people really kind of like understand what I'm talking about

58:03.000 --> 58:07.960
and they can take that into something useful afterwards.

58:07.960 --> 58:13.040
And they also need to review and give comments and feedback to all the work that students

58:13.040 --> 58:14.040
are doing.

58:14.040 --> 58:20.920
My thing with teachers is that sometimes, especially for some schools that, well, I

58:20.920 --> 58:27.000
think it's across multiple institutions, but teachers do a lot of work.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.400
The best piece of advice that I would give is that they're not alone.

58:30.400 --> 58:36.960
Like there's a ton of other teachers there that are looking forward to sharing what they

58:36.960 --> 58:38.680
have done.

58:38.680 --> 58:44.000
From the GitHub side, we have the GitHub campus advisors and we have a private GitHub discussion

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
with all the teachers.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.720
And it has been really cool because they share some of their resources.

58:48.720 --> 58:56.080
So for example, if a teacher has done an intro to algorithms and data structures course on

58:56.080 --> 59:00.280
GitHub, they will share, sometimes they will share, depending on the college, because some

59:00.280 --> 59:06.800
colleges really kind of like protect their property, but some of them are very cool and

59:06.800 --> 59:10.080
they share their resources with other teachers.

59:10.080 --> 59:13.060
So if you're giving the same class, you already have the content.

59:13.060 --> 59:20.920
So you only need to worry about the performance part of your job.

59:20.920 --> 59:26.120
On the other side, I think there's very small things that you can do to make sure that people

59:26.120 --> 59:28.760
really engage with your classroom.

59:28.760 --> 59:35.240
In our case, I know it sounds like it's not a lot, but with GitHub, you're able to, if

59:35.240 --> 59:37.840
you reach out to GitHub, please do it for a teacher.

59:37.840 --> 59:39.340
We would love to help you.

59:39.340 --> 59:42.840
But we send like a swag back to teachers.

59:42.840 --> 59:49.960
With Mona stickers and with Octocad stickers, Mona is our mascot for folks who probably

59:49.960 --> 59:50.960
haven't heard that before.

59:50.960 --> 59:55.840
We send them like cheat sheets and a lot of other resources that they can use while they're

59:55.840 --> 59:58.480
teaching.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:03.200
And it turns out that the impact of these small resources, like the cheat sheet is by

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.320
far one of the most used tool because you have like all the Git commands that probably

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.000
you will be using in one single piece of paper.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.280
It's kind of like these very small things when we support students that do a ton of

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:23.760
impact on their experience managing classrooms.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.760
So reach out to us.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.760
We would love to help.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.480
And I think the most important is that you're not alone.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.880
There's a lot of other teachers that are in the same journey as you are.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.240
If you're just getting started, I would recommend reaching out and talking with teachers that

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.480
have more experience learning from them.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.720
And I think there's some really great resources there for teachers to take.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.400
I think as a whole, you have a very important job.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.560
You're preparing the next generation and we want to make sure that you have all the tools

01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:01.560
that you need to do that the best way possible.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:07.880
Stories from campus advisors, we've heard some really beautiful stories.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880
We have help.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:14.200
I'm talking about Mexico a lot because I'm from Mexico, so I have a really good communication

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.200
with them.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:23.200
But we sent a swag pack to a teacher in an indigenous school in Guerrero, which indigenous

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.720
schools unfortunately are very under-resourced in the country.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.160
And for them, the fact that they got the stickers and the chichits was life-changing for the

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.360
students.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.280
They were very excited about the classroom afterwards.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.880
They were really engaged with the teacher and the teacher has a huge round of applause

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:49.960
to that teacher because he is teaching a technology that is in another language to folks that

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:54.240
speak in one of the multiple indigenous languages in the country.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:59.760
And they're building some absolutely amazing things and they send us a photo every quarter

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.520
of a project that they build and you can always see the students with their GitHub stickers

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.440
and feeling very proud of that.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.640
And I think that's like a super heartwarming story.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.320
But yeah, it's like the small things count a lot, I think, with teachers and there's

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.640
been a lot of movement in the last two years of how we teach and this is like the right

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.600
time for us or what we've noticed as well is that this is the right time to reconnect

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:32.440
with the students, especially if you have the ability to have them there in person.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:37.640
It's a great time to reconnect and really build these trust relations with students.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.400
Being a teacher is much more than just like teaching.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:47.720
You're like a psychologist, a therapist, you are everything, content creator.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.760
So I don't know, I'm just like very astonished with everything that they do.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.080
Yeah, that's beautiful.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.480
Well this was awesome and there's so many good things shared here.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.520
I only have one closing question for you and that is, what is the best piece of advice

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.960
that you've ever received?

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:16.880
I think the best piece of advice that I've received is, it's a great question.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:24.960
I think, so I'm going to give some context because I was building, before I joined GitHub,

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:30.640
I was building like a hack fund in Mexico and it was so hard because it was when hack

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.280
funds were not like a thing.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:39.920
So when we went to like sponsors, our companies to sponsor us, they were like, oh, but what's

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920
a hack fund?

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.920
Are you going to hack the bank?

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.920
We laugh at that right now, right?

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:50.480
But at that time it was like, okay, I expect that they don't know what this is all about

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:51.680
and it was so hard.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.760
It was so hard to raise funds to do the work that we wanted to do.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:05.080
And a friend of mine told me that if it was easy, anybody would be able to make it.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.920
And it's like, you know, when you're going through some hardship on your job or your

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:15.320
work or something, it's like, you know, if you're one of the few that has the ability

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.720
to do it, it's because like it's not easy, like it's going to be challenging sometimes

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.360
to do the work that we do.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.400
And I think that for me was like, yeah, that makes sense.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.720
Like it's, we're the first ones doing that, we're doing that at the time.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.280
People have tried in the past, but didn't work out successfully and I was like, okay,

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.280
that do make sense.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:41.320
So yeah, I think that's my best piece of advice.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.200
Yeah, that's great advice.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.320
And that's for sure.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320
You can see it everywhere.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:52.840
Nobody wants to be the first because it's hard to be the first to do something.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.440
Even if it's just a variation on what somebody else has already done, it's always hard to

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440
be the first one.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:04.000
You see it in these online conferences, like the chat is really quiet until the first person

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.720
posts the, hey, welcome everybody.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.460
Suddenly it starts rolling.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.560
So it's like that thing, like everybody finds it hard to be the first.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:19.720
So if you're the first to do X in your community or in your country, then know it's going to

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.880
be hard, but it's probably going to be worth it at the same time.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:28.160
So I think it's great advice and yeah, people should definitely take that to heart.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.160
Thanks so much, Juan.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.160
This was a wonderful conversation.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.560
I'm so glad this happened and I'm so excited to share this with the community.
