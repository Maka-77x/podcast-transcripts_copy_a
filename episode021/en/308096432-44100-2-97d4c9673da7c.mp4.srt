00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,280
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,560
Hey, Juan, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,440
Hey, thank you for having me, I'm really excited to be here today.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
Yeah.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,440
Yeah, I'm looking forward to this conversation.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,200
So on another podcast I run called the Mechanical Ink Podcast, I had a really good conversation

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,800
with Abby and Nathalie from GitHub about all things open source and all the cool stuff

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,760
that GitHub's doing around that space.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,120
And the education thing came up during our conversation there and they were like, you

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,320
should speak to Juan because he runs all this stuff and he's really enthusiastic about this

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
space.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,560
I was like, that would be great and it would be a perfect fit for the Mycelium Network

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,920
Podcast because of what I do as part of this community.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,320
And hey, it happened and here we are.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,380
So I kind of let the cat out of the bag that you are from GitHub.

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,440
But without saying anything further, I'm going to give the floor to you and let you introduce

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,920
yourself to everybody.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,720
Yeah, we're spoiling the news for our listeners.

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,240
So my name is Juan Pablo Flores, I am a Senior Program Manager here at the GitHub Education

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,680
Team, where my job is to help students across the world to, you know, get opportunities

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,240
on open source, help them to build awesome communities in their campus through the GitHub

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,320
Campus Experts Program.

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,360
And I also kind of like, we do a little bit of everything, but as a whole, my job, my

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,600
main role at GitHub is to support our students on the GitHub Campus Experts Program, which

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:54,400
is our developer program where we teach students how to build or grow welcoming communities

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,680
on their campus so that they can help others get prepared before they graduate.

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,380
Yeah, that's awesome.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,600
It's definitely something I'm going to dig in a little bit more.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,880
On your Twitter, a website that's a little...

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Oh no.

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,480
...hinted at the moment.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,680
I saw you shared a photo of your first two tattoos.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,700
I'm always curious about, like, I don't have any myself, but I always know that when people

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,080
do get these, it's usually, there's usually a story behind it.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,360
So I don't know if you are open to sharing what's behind the story behind your first

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
two.

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,120
Yeah, no, it's a whole story because of course, I think the first tattoo is the one you think

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,840
about the most.

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm already thinking about doing like two or three more in the future, right?

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,760
But the first one is...

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:54,000
So I'm a very big fan of cybernetics and anime and everything that has to do around that.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,680
And I saw these two very cool storyboards from Ghost in the Shell, the animated version.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,440
And when I saw them the first time, I was like, these drawings are just like absolutely

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
amazing.

46
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:16,400
They have really cool details about the head of the shell, let's call it, because that's

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
how it's called the shell, right?

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,640
Which is kind of like this robotic head with a lot of different tubes coming out of it.

49
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,400
And then the next scene or the next storyboard is a brain and the brain has different details

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,720
of parts of the brain and some statistics of the brain that look very cool and very

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
futuristic.

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,000
And I saw it like, I think a year and a half ago and I was like, I would love to have like

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,960
the two of these two storyboards because also like something cool about storyboards is that

54
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,120
it's kind of like this space where they're planning the scenes and they're planning the

55
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,640
movie and what you're going to watch.

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,840
So it has a little bit of that behind the scenes of a movie that I really like.

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,780
So the two storyboards that I got tattooed, one of them is, it's one of the opening scenes

58
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:14,200
is when they're kind of like turning their robots on and it's in a part of the movie

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,960
very specific where they say like, so this is the shell and it's like the head of the

60
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:31,040
robot and then they talk about the ghost inside the shell, which is the brain that you can

61
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,280
see and both are very well put together.

62
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,200
It was so hard to find a tattoo artist that was able to draw them because it's like a

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,240
lot of really small lines.

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,480
So you also need to be very careful in how you maintain it because if you get a ton of

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,280
sun or you try to tan, these lines will diffuse into like each other.

66
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,400
So you need to be very careful with that, but fun story.

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:05,280
I got to know the MosFest team and we are building a space called Humans Behind the

68
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,520
Machine, which turns out to be very related to Ghost in a Shell.

69
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:17,400
So definitely I think there was some inspiration there from attending and just like supporting

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
MosFest.

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Yeah, that's a great story.

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:32,040
I've watched that movie a couple of times and it's intense.

73
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,640
For me personally, I feel like I have to do it in little bits because it's one of those

74
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,800
things like Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and those things, every time you read it,

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,840
every time you watch it, you pick up new details about it and you kind of start connecting

76
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,560
to the true story behind all of it.

77
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,000
So I really enjoy that, it's something I want to watch again in this new year.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
I kind of tend to watch it once a year.

79
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,160
I saw it was really, really cool, but it is very detailed, the tattoo, that's for sure.

80
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,960
It's amazing artwork and amazing artist who did that.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
So yeah.

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah.

83
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
It's like my precious now.

84
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,960
I need to take care of it until it's hard to be destroyed.

85
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Because now I'm in Seattle, right?

86
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Because we don't get a lot of sunlight.

87
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,760
But if I just reach anywhere, I'm just putting a ton of stuff to avoid it getting burned

88
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,720
by the sun.

89
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
That's interesting.

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
I never knew that about tattoos.

91
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Interesting.

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Yeah.

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,200
So as you said, you are program manager for the GitHub education.

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:39,880
And I don't know if all of these topics that I'm going to mention falls under the umbrella.

95
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,040
But some of the things that I know about that, to me, in my mind, fits under this umbrella

96
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,080
is, like you said, the campus experts.

97
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,960
That's the one thing that I'm aware of.

98
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,280
And then other things like GitHub skills, which is something relatively new, where you

99
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,280
can kind of create a course material using a combination of a repo and GitHub actions.

100
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,500
And you kind of tie it all together to teach somebody some kind of skill and base that

101
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,680
around some kind of cool automation using actions.

102
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,740
And then there is GitHub classrooms.

103
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,320
Something that I've looked at a couple of times.

104
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,120
But I think I can't quite connect what exactly it all offers.

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,260
So my question to you is, can you unpack some of these different things?

106
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,320
What does fall under the umbrella that you care what is outside of it?

107
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,080
And just what does all of these things offer both students, but then also educators?

108
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Yeah.

109
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,400
No, there's a big, there's like different audience when we talk about education, right?

110
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,320
Like we have the students, which are the ones that I work with the most.

111
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:50,920
We have teachers who is kind of like, I would say the best or the most important influencers

112
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,720
in the world, because they basically teach the technologies that the sports will be starting

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,920
to use after they graduate, right?

114
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,020
And what I wanted to make sure, our team does manage the managed GitHub classroom.

115
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,760
So GitHub classroom, look at it as a way that a teacher can improve the way that they manage

116
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
their classroom.

117
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,040
So probably when you were a student, or in my case, I remember when I was a student,

118
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:29,280
when I had to like work with code and do like projects, I would need to take a USB and probably

119
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,760
put my code on a USB and do my stuff and then kind of like working with my team was like

120
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,080
absolutely awful because no one knew GitHub at that time.

121
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,280
I mean, I don't want to say that I'm old though, but it was not one of those things that you

122
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,920
would learn in college to know how to work together, which I think is one of the most

123
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,920
fundamental things that any developer needs to learn is how do we work together with code?

124
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,080
It's very likely that as a developer, you will work in a team, if not with other people

125
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,800
in the internet or in an office.

126
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,480
So learning how to work together is one of those skills that I'm surprised it is not

127
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,880
still kind of part of the curriculum, but that has a fundamental part on any student's

128
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,000
role or future, especially because it's not only about doing code, but it's also about

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,680
like communicating and it's also about like how do you avoid or divide work?

130
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,080
So it's much more complex than just like doing a git commit, git push and git pull, right?

131
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,920
So with GitHub Classroom, we try to lower the barrier of entry for both students and

132
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,800
teachers so that a teacher, for example, if you're creating curricula, you can distribute

133
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,240
that curricula through GitHub.

134
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,120
So instead of sharing a link with a link with everyone and then students having to like

135
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,880
work and then it becomes a little bit messy, everyone gets, everyone can click a link and

136
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,960
they form like teams and they have like everything set up to start working on a GitHub repository.

137
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,040
Now this helps the teacher because the teacher can see each of the individual repositories

138
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,360
that students are working on and it also helps the student because they would have everything

139
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
that they need.

140
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,440
Like GitHub, while GitHub in specific and GitHub repositories, I like to think about

141
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,520
it as not only as code, but as content as well.

142
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,080
So especially when we talk about learning, GitHub repositories offer great pieces of

143
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,360
content that people is not only pushing code, but they're also pushing documentation and

144
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,760
they're pushing like all of these automations for folks to kind of like learn online and

145
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
the same thing happens with GitHub Classroom.

146
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,880
So GitHub Classroom not only offers teachers these control of like, hey, what's kind of

147
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,720
like the current status of the project they can review, even like if you are one of those

148
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,960
teachers that really wants to get into it, you can see, you know, who developed which

149
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,480
part of the code base because you have Git involved.

150
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,640
So you can even see if they really work together or if it was like someone that did everything.

151
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:24,800
But also for teachers, there's this tool that I forgot the specific name, but they can set

152
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,400
up a few GitHub actions and automations to review their submissions automatically so

153
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:37,840
that once they have like, well, once all the tests pass, the student is able to merge it

154
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,320
and they get like the scoring for the work that they did.

155
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,120
So in essence, and then teachers can connect these to any of the tools or platforms that

156
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,520
they're using to match their classroom or, you know, these massive tools where you have

157
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,680
like the rooster of students and you match like the grades and everything.

158
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,480
There's also some automations there so that teachers have to do less of the work of managing

159
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,680
the technical side and they can focus more on teaching the classes that they have to.

160
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,240
On the other side, GitHub skills, it's not based on the education team, but definitely

161
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,240
I think is one of the coolest tools that we have because it's kind of like, in some sort

162
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,560
of ways, it's kind of a companion for you to learn.

163
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,600
In this case, or for the most part, how to use them, how to use Git and GitHub.

164
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,760
And it's not only kind of like, here's like these massive like documentation about how

165
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,840
to use Git and GitHub, but as you start doing very small steps, it starts to unlock the

166
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,520
next step and more knowledge.

167
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,720
So that, you know, one of the problems that we've learned is that pitching Git and GitHub

168
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
is complex.

169
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,520
Like it's not easy, especially when you are getting started in your career.

170
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,960
People throw at you like not only how to use like Git commands, but how to use a command

171
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,120
line and how to use a terminal and then it's how to use a new platform and everyone tries

172
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,160
to merge everything in a very short amount of time.

173
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,280
And with GitHub skills, you take a little bit of like more of like baby steps and help

174
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,880
folks start to build that learning without overwhelming them with all the knowledge that

175
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,880
they might need to use the platform at its fullest.

176
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,600
And this is something I don't remember the name, but it's the reverse pyramid, the reverse

177
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,680
concept pyramid, something like that.

178
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,640
So it's just a lot of video games where they're teaching you how to use the game.

179
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,800
They don't make you like fight a massive boss or anything, but first it's like this is how

180
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,920
you walk and this is how to jump and this is how you hit the monster.

181
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,720
And then they put you like a boss, right, but unless you're playing like Elden Ring

182
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,400
or something where you suffer playing, right.

183
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:56,080
The whole idea is to teach you step by step how to do the thing and then with GitHub skills

184
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,160
kind of like evolving and showing you more steps that you can do and more stuff, the

185
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,520
students avoid, well, the students and professional developers have a clear path on how they can

186
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
master GitHub.

187
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Yeah.

188
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Yeah.

189
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Well, it's great.

190
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:18,120
I've used GitHub skills to just as an experiment to just basically see how I would set up a

191
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,160
basic like this is how you would do a pull request and like have a little GitHub skill

192
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,560
that takes you through the steps of forking and then once you fork, you do this and that

193
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,440
and that and then pull request and then it's merged and yeah, you pass to the GitHub skill.

194
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,720
It's really, really useful.

195
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,760
It takes a little bit of getting used to at the beginning, just getting an on-ramp and

196
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,880
understanding how the actions fit together and how the end of the action triggers the

197
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,120
next step and all that kind of stuff.

198
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,440
But once you've done it once, like doing the second one is much easier and the third one

199
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,500
is even easier.

200
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,320
So it's one of those things where it's like your knowledge builds on top of each other

201
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,120
and eventually, you'll just end up creating a whole bunch of little courses and it's great

202
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,040
for a bunch of stuff because you can have automated tests.

203
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,160
So if you did the JavaScript, for example, correctly, the test should all pass.

204
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,360
If they don't, then while you've done something wrong, so you have to go have a look and you

205
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,160
can try and be as clever as possible to try and detect certain common mistakes so that

206
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,200
you can highlight it via comment on the pull request, like this is probably what you've

207
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,720
done wrong because this specific test has failed.

208
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,320
So yeah, I think there's a lot of potential there, but there is like a little bit of a

209
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,400
learning curve, but I think it's fair.

210
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,440
Because the value you get out of it, like the learning, the time you have to take to

211
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,560
learn it is worth that time, I think.

212
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,640
But you brought up something interesting that I was going to ask later, but I might as well

213
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
bring it up now.

214
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:55,120
So I was going to ask you if you have any advice for aspiring developers and young and

215
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,640
old just starting out in their career, but then I wanted to bring in that part where

216
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:08,760
like exactly like you said, being a maker, a coder, a developer, technical writer, whatever

217
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,760
it is that you're doing in tech, writing code or writing the documentation is only one part

218
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,840
of the job.

219
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,420
A big part of the job is like working with others.

220
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,520
And if you don't understand how to do that well, it can often turn a really great job

221
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,080
into a drag because you're just struggling to work with people.

222
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,720
So I don't know, seeing that you also agree that that is something that's missing from

223
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,680
curricula and stuff like that, what advice do you have for people starting their career?

224
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,160
Like what is the important things to think about?

225
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:49,200
Yeah, no, especially with the last part, I have to say that I'm going to take my very

226
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
personal space.

227
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,900
I remember going to college and there was like this communication class that you need

228
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
to take, right?

229
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,680
And everyone saw that class as just like, oh, just like a class they put to fill up

230
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,880
like the curricula, right?

231
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,360
Or something that is not important because people, you know, as a developer, you only

232
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,940
care about the technical side, right?

233
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,960
Like you only want to code and be the perfect developer.

234
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,960
And unfortunately, that sense, I don't know if it happens in other countries.

235
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,600
I know it happens a lot in Mexico, especially in the university that I went to.

236
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,400
But I agree that, you know, one of the biggest challenges that I found, and this is from

237
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,720
my experience working with students from across the world, is that every culture has its

238
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,520
very, you can see culture in the communication style of a person.

239
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,960
And what I mean by that is there are some cultures that are very open to work in public

240
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,000
and share if they are finding a bar or if they are struggling with something.

241
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,800
There are some other cultures that prefer to do that privately because they don't want

242
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,800
to expose themselves or they don't want to get the attention from other people.

243
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,000
There are folks that like very direct communication.

244
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,880
So they won't tell you like a very long, hello, how are you doing?

245
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
I hope everything is doing great.

246
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,360
There's like some other cultures that do that because they really value like building a

247
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,040
connection as well.

248
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,320
So communication, I would say, is by far one of the hardest things for any developer, especially

249
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,560
if you work in open source.

250
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,840
Communication is essential so that you don't build on top of someone's full request by

251
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,640
mistake so that you don't take an issue that probably someone else already has taken or

252
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,120
someone or, you know, just like there's so many parts that require communication in our

253
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:44,160
everyday lives that I think it needs a little bit more.

254
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,280
It should be taken a little bit more seriously, especially in a world where working with folks

255
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,200
from the other side of the world, which is like you and I, we're talking during South

256
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Africa.

257
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,120
I mean Seattle is almost like across the world.

258
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,840
So cultures change a lot and understanding that there are different communication styles,

259
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,120
I would say helps a lot of folks to get more confident of being able to propose things,

260
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,880
but also to understand the behaviors that they see other people are doing.

261
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,240
So definitely communication and understanding different cultures I'd say is one of the most

262
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,120
important skills that you can develop.

263
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,560
And I understand that for some folks, like working in a national or local company is

264
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,640
more than enough and that's okay, but you never know.

265
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,120
Like I would even like within a country, culture is so different.

266
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:45,200
So I think it's still very important that, you know, we dedicate some time to think or

267
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,080
learn how different communication styles work and that will effectively help us to have

268
00:19:51,080 --> 00:20:00,120
a better work spaces and healthier communication channels with both like the work that we do

269
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,800
professionally, the work that we do personally, and in general like with the communities as

270
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
well that we help.

271
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I completely forgot what was the other question though.

272
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
I got too much into this.

273
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
No, no, no, no, that's perfect.

274
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Yeah.

275
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
No, it was just like any, I think you've covered all the bases there.

276
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,760
I think it's good.

277
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,920
I agree with what you've said there with that in mind and talking about communication.

278
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,280
So as an educator, of course, that is key.

279
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,840
Like if you can't communicate well, you're going to have a tough time teaching people

280
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,580
because not only do you have to transfer knowledge, but you have to do it in a way where you can

281
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:48,160
keep their attention and get their interest, make them excited about the stuff that you're

282
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,800
learning because that's the only way that we retain knowledge is if we're actually enjoying

283
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
what we're doing.

284
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,240
So you have to think about how you communicate.

285
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,440
So along those lines, there's so many ways to teach these days.

286
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,160
Like we touched on GitHub classroom, for example, we touched on the automated side of it where

287
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:14,560
it's you're kind of playing a game with, against or not against, with a machine learning thing

288
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
like GitHub skills.

289
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,800
You know, it's like you're there, the human doing your thing, and there's a machine telling

290
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,160
you whether you succeeded or failed and stuff like that.

291
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,360
And then there is another thing that's, I've kind of tried it and then stopped and now

292
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,880
I'm kind of considering going back to it because of a talk I heard at Universe, GitHub Universe.

293
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,560
And interestingly enough, when I was reading up about some of the stuff that you've been

294
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,920
doing that you've done in your past, you were actually involved with a research paper around

295
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,200
this idea of streaming on places like Twitch.

296
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,600
And specifically around audience and streamer participation at the scale of Twitch.

297
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,960
So thinking about that, and I've heard so many people say that, you know, Twitch can

298
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,560
actually be a great place to teach.

299
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
What do you think about that?

300
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:10,280
And what advice and thoughts do you have around this whole idea of using a platform that most

301
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,160
people won't even associate with this idea?

302
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,960
But do you agree that this can be a successful platform?

303
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,800
And if so, do you have any like kind of advice for people that are thinking about doing this?

304
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,960
Yeah.

305
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:31,000
So Twitch, that research, it was such a great time because it was like before the pandemic.

306
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,520
And I got this awesome opportunity to work with a lab in West Virginia University and

307
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,040
Carnegie Mellon to, they were doing something called audience participation games, which

308
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,320
is basically, you know, when you have an audience like on Twitch, how can you involve your audience

309
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,520
to be part of something that they're watching, like you're consuming content, but at the

310
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,200
same time, you are building that content as well with the host.

311
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,640
And this whole research came out of the Twitch Plays Pokemon stream, which happened like

312
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,600
a few years ago, people had kind of like the control of the character on Pokemon.

313
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,920
I don't remember which version, but basically, like anyone on the audience was able to send

314
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,760
a message in chat and depending on the command that they sent, the character on the video

315
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,880
game would do something.

316
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:33,800
And it was a bomb of an event to have Twitch Plays Pokemon, like a huge community of developers

317
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,040
came together.

318
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,360
They normally would lose all of their items, so they would like release all the Pokemons

319
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,240
and lose all the Master Balls and all the Pokeballs that they had.

320
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,240
So it was hilarious to see it, but it was really interesting because you can analyze

321
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:57,440
a lot of like human behavior with these games and, you know, I think there was like this

322
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,560
item that you were not able to throw away in the game.

323
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,640
And the audience took that as kind of like the relic, like the most important item, and

324
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,480
they had like stories about the shell, it was a shell, about the shell and how the shell

325
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,440
represents the game and represents what they were there for.

326
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,000
And it was absolutely incredible how a community was built around that.

327
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,560
I think for Twitch, Twitch has, it's very interesting because I really like Twitch as

328
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,240
a medium of learning.

329
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,160
I think one of the challenges that Twitch has to become a learning platform is that

330
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,600
it's very, very immediate, which means if you lose a show, you lose the content.

331
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,480
So probably you won't be able to watch a replay around Twitch.

332
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,040
And that's what makes other platforms become so successful is that you can, probably if

333
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,920
you miss it, that's okay, but then you can watch the replay or you can watch the recording

334
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,400
afterwards and with Twitch that happens.

335
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,880
But unfortunately, like a lot of those pieces of content gets lost because Twitch has like

336
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,160
these 30 days bot time-lapse.

337
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,240
Some accounts will have that like unlimited though, but the typical thing is like five

338
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,320
to 30 days.

339
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:24,360
So what we've learned through this research, my job was a lot more on how audiences work

340
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,720
as you grow your channel.

341
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,600
So we define like five different clusters of channels on Twitch, depending on how big

342
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,440
they were and which work and like the relationships that we see.

343
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,160
And it's very interesting because when you're a small channel, you can really create personal

344
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,760
connections between the audience and the host.

345
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,840
But then you have like these stadium, we call them stadium size channels where you have

346
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,280
like 35,000 people watching, which is incredible to think about.

347
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:03,160
But it becomes like a stadium where it stops being like Juan and I don't know, Fer or whoever

348
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
it is.

349
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,520
And it's just like, hey, Chad, how's it going?

350
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,320
So it's like, oh, that's interesting.

351
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,400
When do you become Chad and when are you like someone, right?

352
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,960
So at the end, our thing was much more about how the audience and hosts relate and communicate

353
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,640
during this kind of growth, depending on where your channel was sitting on.

354
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,720
In terms of education, there's some really cool things that I've seen around.

355
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,480
I've seen that folks are, first of all, they feel less pressured to join a live stream,

356
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,300
especially if you have guests.

357
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,080
So if you're a streamer and you're like, hey, do you want to jump in and chat?

358
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,960
People are more likely to jump in and chat than if you tell them like, hey, I'm making

359
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,480
this YouTube video about XYZ, do you want to jump in?

360
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,280
They're like, oh, but I need to prepare because this is going to be recorded and this is going

361
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
to be...

362
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,000
So definitely there's a little bit more planning sometimes on YouTube.

363
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,520
And for learning, I think Twitch still has a long way to go.

364
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,320
I think it is a great platform for building great connections and building a community

365
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,120
and bringing everyone together.

366
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,080
A lot of folks are using these learning public type of streams where you probably are learning

367
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,240
some new thing and you stream yourself doing so.

368
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,800
It's really cool because then chat kind of helps you out as well if you're making a mistake,

369
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,680
they will point that out in Twitch chat.

370
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,840
But also it's a little bit, since it's not as formal as probably like the traditional

371
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,020
education system, some folks feel more enticed to participate.

372
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,560
So if something funny happens, people take that opportunity to kind of like jump into

373
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,240
chat and engage.

374
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:50,760
So I think it allows people to engage a little bit more and really build a community around

375
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,320
learning these type of things.

376
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,200
Now what I see a lot of the streamers are doing is that they do the live stream and

377
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,800
then they take the recording, edit, and then publish that on other platforms so that they

378
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,680
can have this content evergreen.

379
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,400
And I think that's like the best move that you can do because then you feed from the

380
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,120
other platform's audience back to Twitch and then you feed your Twitch audience back to

381
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
these other platforms.

382
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,480
So it's kind of like a very good cycle that I've seen has working really good, especially

383
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
if you're interested in creating content.

384
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,360
Doing that will really help you to grow your channel really fast.

385
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,320
Yeah, that's good advice.

386
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,160
Yeah, it's interesting.

387
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,080
I'm definitely trying it again.

388
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,960
But I think what you've said here is interesting is maybe I think maybe it's just you have

389
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,360
to rethink based on the platform, what you do, how you do things.

390
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,240
I like this idea where people think like because Twitch is a little ephemeral in a sense, it's

391
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,560
more forgiving.

392
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,120
And so people aren't so concerned about making a blunder on a live stream because they're

393
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,080
like, ah, it's going to go away in a couple of days.

394
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
It's fine.

395
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,640
Whereas if it's something that's going to stay around forever, they might be like, I

396
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,240
have to, like you said, be really well prepared for this so that I don't get called out because

397
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:17,960
I said something that wasn't quite accurate or whatever the case may be.

398
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,640
But then maybe it's a natural evolution of the education system.

399
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,800
I think everybody acknowledges that it's not what it should be.

400
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,520
It's not what it can be.

401
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,400
And maybe this is one of those experiments that a lot of people are trying to see if

402
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:42,600
maybe this is an evolution of education and this is what the folks of nowadays gravitate

403
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
toward.

404
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,120
This is how they'd like to learn by kind of observing and then joining in when they feel

405
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,960
comfortable.

406
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,840
As part of like a lot of the stuff that I do, especially with the MyCNM network, that's

407
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,360
how I try and entice people to get involved is by not forcing them into the public or

408
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,760
saying you have to do this thing, but kind of allowing them to participate on the sidelines

409
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,560
for as long as they need and then starting to slowly maybe speak up about something and

410
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,800
see that, oh, okay, wait, that wasn't that bad.

411
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,400
And then they'll try it again and they'll maybe try it again.

412
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,680
So I think another aspect... Go for it.

413
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Oh, sorry.

414
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,000
I think there's a couple of really cool things that I've noticed.

415
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,800
The first one is, for example, if you see Harvard CS50, it's one of these massive online

416
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:46,560
courses on getting started with computer science.

417
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
It has both components.

418
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,240
It has a pre-recording component and then a live component to it as well.

419
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
That worked really good.

420
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,400
And it's opening Harvard classes to everyone in the world and you can watch them whenever

421
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
fits your time best.

422
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:07,440
You don't need to be there 9 a.m. and probably tired of everything that happened the day

423
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,160
before or probably you didn't have a good sleep, you still need to be there.

424
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,620
And that flexibility is welcomed by a lot of folks.

425
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,480
So the first thing is, yes, there's a lot of new content and especially after the last

426
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,560
couple of years, the amount of content that was produced is incredible.

427
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,880
So anyone, you can learn a ton of stuff.

428
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:36,000
I think the hardest thing now is navigating the content and finding the content that fits

429
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,360
your style the most or that is quality content.

430
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,880
The other side is that there was a lot of experimentation being done during these last

431
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:54,160
two years and one of the things that I really liked of one of our student events, they organized

432
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,240
a series of workshops on Minecraft.

433
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,960
So they brought their entire community to Minecraft and everyone has their characters

434
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,440
and it's fun because you're playing a video game but they're also learning and teaching

435
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,160
and stuff and people really like that.

436
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:19,080
And I'm the least creative person in the world but I think the fact that people have the

437
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:25,040
opportunity to experiment with new mediums and new places and new spaces really helped

438
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,440
out to find out different ways to do the things that we have always done the same way.

439
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,840
Like you're now, if you want to become a software developer, software engineer, computer scientist,

440
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:44,120
you're not now entirely locked into a classroom but there's so many different ways in which

441
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,540
you can build your career and for example, open source is a great way to gather professional

442
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:58,200
experience without the hustle of internships and finding a job.

443
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,840
You can start learning some really good professional skills just by jumping into a repository

444
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,440
and asking how can I help to make this repository better, right?

445
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,480
And a lot of that is what we talk, it's not only the communication but also the technical

446
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,200
side that you can learn through open source.

447
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,640
Yeah, and to that point, so Stormy Peters who's also at GitHub now mentioned during

448
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:30,680
a talk she gave at Universe that by 2030 it's estimated that we'll need around 1.6 million

449
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,480
new developers joining the tech industry.

450
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,440
That's a lot of new developers in what, it's seven years remaining.

451
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,920
So I mean, GitHub is doing a lot of this stuff.

452
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,680
So I'm going to jump between a couple of things here.

453
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:53,920
So I think the first question I want to ask around that topic is what do you see as the

454
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:01,840
role of community such as the MyCDM network in helping us get to that 1.6 million?

455
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,600
But also something that I'm very interested in is twofold.

456
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,560
One is using open source as the vehicle.

457
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:16,080
And two, making diversity, equity and inclusion a natural part of these communities.

458
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,040
It's not this thing that you like tack on at the end to try and like, oh yeah, we have

459
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,320
to be diverse.

460
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,240
It's kind of just naturally, it naturally just happens because of the way you communicate,

461
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,920
maybe the platforms you choose.

462
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,840
I'd just love to hear your thoughts on the whole big topic.

463
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,480
Yeah, no, these are three big topics.

464
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:45,200
I think, so for us, communities are fundamental at GitHub, especially with GitHub education.

465
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:53,040
We do a lot of efforts with, for example, campus experts.

466
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,640
It's not only, it's kind of like a very different type of program where you would normally see

467
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:07,080
these master programs in the industry where it's like, oh yeah, teach X, Y, Z like technologies.

468
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,960
I think with campus experts, what we're trying to do is to be a little bit more in-depth

469
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,440
on the role of communities, especially with student communities.

470
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,520
And a big part of that for us is making sure, first is making sure that the student has

471
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,440
all the tools and resources that they need to be able to build a successful community.

472
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,640
And it's not only, I think one of the biggest mistakes that I've seen is that a lot of folks

473
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,360
open a community because it's the thing that other people are doing.

474
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,920
And instead of that, we wanted to make sure that the students are part of the program,

475
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:50,640
that they understand that a community is a tool that you can use to get X amount of people

476
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,520
or a certain population to a specific goal.

477
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,920
So instead of thinking of a community as the end goal of like, let's build that, I don't

478
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:07,200
know, a water community, because we want everyone to know about water, it's like, is a community

479
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,440
the right tool to make sure that that happens?

480
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,400
Or is it just, do you just need like a conference about like water and not a community?

481
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:23,840
And I think as developers, we try to use communities as the tool that solves every one of our problems.

482
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,400
We want to make sure that people think a little bit more about their communities.

483
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,560
So the first thing that we do is we teach students six different modules.

484
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,760
So they could have core skills to organize or have a community.

485
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,740
So we first take them through a community assessment.

486
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,400
So basically like, what's your community looking like, what are some of the struggles, what's

487
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,280
the mission of the community?

488
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Then we make them go through diversity and inclusion, which is module number two.

489
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:03,320
And it's essentially thinking of what are some minorities in your city, in your location

490
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,800
that might be feeling left behind or left outside of these events?

491
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,240
And then once they analyze which are these communities, how can you make sure that they

492
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,080
feel welcomed in your community?

493
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:23,000
And how can you reach out to them or where can you find them so that you can do an intentional

494
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,480
effort to invite them and be part of the events that you're doing?

495
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:35,240
And I think these two are very core components of the program, because it's not only about,

496
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,320
let's do diversity and inclusion because it's what, as you mentioned, it's the last thing

497
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,160
that we will care about or it's what other people are doing, but rather it's like, who

498
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,160
are some people in my university that probably don't feel welcomed to join these events?

499
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,840
And that's very different in each country.

500
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:59,900
Every city has a different set of groups that might not fit that they belong in tech.

501
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:05,200
So it's not something that we as program managers can say, yeah, you need to focus

502
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,200
on this population because they are a minority, but rather we leave that to the student and

503
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,520
we guide them into really understanding who these populations might be so that they can

504
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,960
then start planning how they can reach out to them, invite them, and make sure that they

505
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:28,120
have a safe space for them to be, to attend or to be or to just join the event.

506
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:34,760
Then we teach them about how to do workshops, how to do talks, we teach them how to talk

507
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,880
about technical concepts in a much more easier way so that everyone can understand, and then

508
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,920
at the end they do a community proposal, which is basically the culmination of everything

509
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:52,560
that they have learned in the past five modules, and they make a proposal based on what they

510
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,120
see the community struggles are, where they want the community to be, what are some diversity

511
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,760
and inclusion barriers that they might find, and then they build this proposal of, okay,

512
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:10,320
if I want to solve issue number one, I need to make a workshop about technology XYZ, or

513
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:17,800
if I want more people, the most common thing that we see is that students want to bridge

514
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,360
the gap between industry and academia, so it's like, okay, why don't you bring some

515
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,440
people from the industry into your university to have conversations about things that they're

516
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,880
looking for, and some people are like, I want people to be together and get to know each

517
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,520
other because sometimes university can be a little bit isolating, so they organize get

518
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:45,200
togethers or a hackathon or some fun project, so again, it's not much about using a community

519
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,000
as the end goal, but rather as a tool to bring your community where you want it to be, and

520
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,160
then events serve the same thing, we see all the time of, I want to organize the biggest

521
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,560
hackathon in the world because we want to be the biggest one, and it's like, that's

522
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:05,320
fun though, but if you can have a thousand people and if they have a terrible experience,

523
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:11,640
they won't come back, why don't you focus on a smaller event where everyone has an absolutely

524
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,600
crazy, great amount of time so that they come back in the future or they have something

525
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:23,840
cool to take back with them after the event finishes, so it's a lot of making students

526
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:30,760
rethink about all of these things that they have heard and making sure that they have

527
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,440
this deep understanding on not only what they're doing, but also how can they take their communities

528
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,320
where they want them to be, and going back to the question because I deviated a ton,

529
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,560
the same thing happens with learning and communities, right, I know, there's, I think for every

530
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,400
city that I've visited, there's someone that wants to get more people into open source,

531
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,960
want to make sure that people have someone that they can reach out to, to learn or grow

532
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,080
their skills, and I think communities can play a really good role there to, you know,

533
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,760
like they understand the context, the local context, and they are going to be better like

534
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,840
teaching new technologies or helping folks to learn about tech and computer science better

535
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:23,360
than any company from the US will be able to, so communities are kind of like those folks

536
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,080
that, you know, and this is why, for example, the Mozilla developer network is so important,

537
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:34,440
like you publish the documentation and you publish these amazing like resources for folks,

538
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,200
but they don't work if nobody kind of like teaches them locally or they take them and

539
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,040
they make their own and then they modify it a little bit so that folks in their city are

540
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,520
able to understand it better, so you create this kind of like neutral documentation and

541
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,760
then people can, as kind of like content creators, right, like they take these things that they

542
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,560
see and they make their own, they modify it, they put, and if you're in Mexico, you put

543
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,520
a little bit of salsa to it and then you share that to your community, right, and that's

544
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,560
kind of like the whole goal of communities, like these people understand the struggles

545
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,060
and their community is better than we do and they can create content that is more fitting

546
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:16,720
to the local context than what we would ever going to do, because if you go or I go to

547
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,920
these communities, I'm probably going to teach the neutral documentation and they'll be

548
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,960
like, okay, that was fun, but like I didn't get it, and it's better if someone that really,

549
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,440
you know, like is building that community and that sense of belonging and that trust

550
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:37,480
with the community as well, is they have better tools to give these new content to their communities

551
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,880
better than we could ever do.

552
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,120
Now in terms of, I don't know if that makes sense to you, I think.

553
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,760
Yeah, yeah, totally, no, yeah, that's great, yeah.

554
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,240
So I think language plays a big role there, right?

555
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,480
I think you kind of touched on something, I think language plays a big role, like when

556
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,560
you talk about local communities taking content and then making it their own.

557
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,120
I think that one of the big things is just the language, like if it's only available

558
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,960
in English, that in itself might be a barrier.

559
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,880
I think at the beginning, you mentioned that like, get and get up and teaching that is

560
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:27,880
get up less, but to some extent, but get more specifically is often not taught at the beginning.

561
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:35,120
And so we've actually seen that in a group that you would think this is not a problem,

562
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,480
it is been the one big stumbling block.

563
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,320
Like for example, at the Write the Docs conference in Portland, just speaking with these technical

564
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,060
writers that that's their job is writing technical content.

565
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,000
When you ask them what is one of the biggest hurdles to contributing to an open source

566
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,360
project, say for example, MDN Web Docs, they would say get, honestly, I'm not sure how

567
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,240
to use get properly, I'm always scared I mess everything up.

568
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,120
I'm not 100% sure how the whole branching and pull request thing works, and that is

569
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,280
why I really don't.

570
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:21,760
There are of course other factors as well, that's cultural and sometimes it's us maybe

571
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,160
not yet creating as welcoming a space as we think we are.

572
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,760
It's also, but far and away, one of the biggest things is just this core thing.

573
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,720
And I think if you're in that community, you will understand that much better than somebody

574
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,480
looking from the outside.

575
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:45,080
Because as a coder or something, you might think like, get is just, it's not easy by

576
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:51,440
no means, but the basic commands you need to be productive aren't that hard.

577
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,920
But that is for you, who uses this every day.

578
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,480
For somebody who that is not core to doing their job, it's a different story.

579
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,840
And I think that plays into the spoken language as well.

580
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
Yes.

581
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:15,440
Language and I think, well, we can nerd about documentation and stuff for ages, but there's

582
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:23,680
one thing that I met Rachel Lee neighbors, she is absolutely amazing.

583
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,320
We were talking about this because we were going through the same struggle of like, we

584
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:33,840
want to make sure our documentation is accessible to everyone, but it's so hard because of like

585
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,880
maintaining one piece of documentation in English is hard and then you try to translate

586
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,360
everything into multiple languages, it becomes absolutely unmanageable.

587
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,800
So especially if you have a small team, right?

588
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,200
If you have like a thousand person team, like congratulations and it's great to hear there's

589
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,520
a lot of such teams, but what she mentioned, and I think this makes a ton of sense is that

590
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,040
one of the best tips that she can do, first of all, yes, communities play a good, a massive

591
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,400
role there.

592
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,880
But the second thing is making sure that your documentation is easily translatable by machine,

593
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:24,160
which means a lot of folks would click the Google Chrome or Firefox auto-translate tool

594
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,960
to get the conditions on their own language.

595
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,240
So making sure that that translation is a quality translation and making your documentation

596
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:39,480
easily translatable by a machine plays a better role than redoing your whole documentation

597
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,400
in a different language.

598
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:50,720
So I mean, this is going to be a little bit of not me thinking of me product maintaining,

599
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,240
like thinking of product and documentation as a product is like maintaining languages

600
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:00,040
is so hard, so expensive, and it really requires a lot of resources.

601
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,880
If you don't have the team to be able to do so, what you can do is to make sure that it

602
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,760
is translatable by a machine and that it makes sense after the machine translates it.

603
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:19,600
Do you think that is simply avoiding stuff like jargon, avoiding not spelling out acronyms

604
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,280
before you actually start using them?

605
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,000
Do you think those are the kinds of things that you would do?

606
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah.

607
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,280
No, Charlie, I think there's, I mean, I'm not an expert in documentation, unfortunately.

608
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:40,180
I would love to, but there's very small, and I think this has been best practices on documentation

609
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:45,160
writing for a long time that really helped out the algorithm to make the translation

610
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,160
the best.

611
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,160
Yeah.

612
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,160
Yeah.

613
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
Yeah, I know.

614
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,360
I would love to get somebody on here to talk about just, I spoke with Chris Mills, who's

615
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,560
been doing technical writing for a very long time, but it'd be interesting to talk to like

616
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,560
maybe two or three technical writers on one of these episodes and just, because I think

617
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,120
it's so critical to have good documentation, especially for open source projects.

618
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:13,220
I think some of the most successful open source projects are successful because their documentation

619
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,720
is so good.

620
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:21,560
I know one of the reasons Vue.js got such a big fan base in China as opposed to React,

621
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,840
which the rest of the world seems to have chosen as their framework of choice, is because

622
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:33,560
the documentation for Vue is available in Chinese from the get-go because Evan Yeo is

623
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:38,640
from China originally, and so it was important for him to ensure that that documentation

624
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,800
is available in Chinese because he knows how important that is to people in China.

625
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:51,400
So it's interesting, and I mean for myself as a developer and a maker, if I want to use

626
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,240
your tool or your framework or your whatever, if your documentation is terrible, then that

627
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,480
is definitely the first place where I'm going to probably see if there's another option

628
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
available.

629
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,000
That has good documentation.

630
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,240
So I think it's something that's critical to understand well and then to understand

631
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,120
how to write this, like you said, so it is machine translatable in an efficient manner,

632
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,680
so it doesn't translate in a way that it no longer makes sense.

633
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,560
Like you read it in Spanish and you're like, I'm not exactly sure that's what they were

634
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,960
trying to say here, and you kind of have to switch back to the English version.

635
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,960
That's really good.

636
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
That's interesting.

637
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,280
I haven't thought about it from that way.

638
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,280
That's really interesting.

639
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,600
And also, as an open source maintainer, making sure that your documentation is clean and

640
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,320
understandable helps you onboard more folks into using your tools.

641
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:47,840
So it also ends up benefiting you in terms of how many people are using the tools.

642
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,640
If that's the goal of you, you're creating the project, right?

643
00:49:52,640 --> 00:50:00,560
So I think for a lot of the research that we've done with open source projects, thinking

644
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:07,800
why is it sometimes hard for some folks to use open source every day is because onboarding

645
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:13,440
to using these tools sometimes is a little bit hard for some folks that either they're

646
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,760
changing their careers or they're just getting started and they hear about XYZ technology,

647
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,040
but they don't understand the onboarding.

648
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,320
Unfortunately, people leave really fast.

649
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:32,600
And talking about open source and open source for learning, I think some of the research

650
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:39,680
that we've done in the past is for us, I think internships are awesome, but unfortunately

651
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,320
not everyone has access to an internship close to them.

652
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:51,760
Internships are still very geo-located to the US, Canada, and Europe.

653
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,760
There's some in India that are starting, which I think is amazing.

654
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,840
But unfortunately, outside of these programs, it's really hard to get into an internship.

655
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,040
Either you will need to apply to the company and then see if they will offer you a visa

656
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,560
to be able to work during the internship, which that opens a whole different kind of

657
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:17,720
worms, or you would need to find other ways in which you can gain experience.

658
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,280
At the end, that's the whole goal, right?

659
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:25,160
We want to make sure that folks get this experience of being out there and learning how things

660
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,880
are done outside of the academia before they graduate, because it's really valuable for

661
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,560
them and for the industry.

662
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:39,400
At the end, something that we've learned is just by supporting student developers, we

663
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,560
help the whole industry.

664
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,480
We make sure that folks, before they graduate, they come with more experience and with better

665
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:54,560
tools and better classes, the whole industry levels up as well.

666
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:58,000
It's in the long term, it's not going to be immediate, but definitely it's worth making

667
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,320
the investment to help the next generation to have everything that they need to be awesome.

668
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:11,800
On the other side, I think open source is very democratic on the way that it works.

669
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:18,480
As a student, you're able to go to any open source repository and see what are some of

670
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,360
the issues that are open and explore the technology.

671
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:27,000
What I really like about open source is that no one asks you for your resume to make a

672
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
contribution.

673
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,480
It would suck if you would have to be like, oh yeah, here's my experience on these type

674
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,480
of projects.

675
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,200
These are some contributions that I've made, and this is why my pull request should be

676
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,000
the one that you accept.

677
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,760
That would break open source at its core.

678
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,840
Yeah, yeah, well said, well said.

679
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,120
Open source offers a very democratic entrance for everyone to make these contributions and

680
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:01,680
start gaining more experience with how code is built.

681
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,040
I love the fact that it doesn't matter where you're coming from.

682
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,000
We are trying to find ways in which we can help folks to contribute to these open source

683
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
projects.

684
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:18,080
A lot of that as well is some of the challenges is navigating open source, which is how can

685
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:24,040
I find an issue that I can contribute to, which has been a challenge from eternity.

686
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:30,960
Not only that, but also how do I make sure... A lot of folks, especially students that

687
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:36,120
are making their first open source contribution, there's a lot of imposter syndrome involved.

688
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:44,040
You have the code that probably the maintainer or the contributors are looking for, but the

689
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:50,120
students really doubt themselves if this is some valuable piece of code.

690
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:54,280
Another big problem that we've seen is imposter syndrome in the industry, which I think is

691
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,320
kind of like a pandemic.

692
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,840
Everyone has imposter syndrome at some point in their career, but once again, when we talk

693
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:07,840
about cultures, exposing your work to the world and having an open source maintainer

694
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:13,040
of a project that probably you're a big fan of review your code, that's challenging if

695
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,240
it's the first time that you're making this contribution.

696
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:24,560
There's a few challenges, but from what I've seen, more companies are putting attention

697
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,400
into the activities that folks have on GitHub.

698
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:35,080
So if you're making contributions to open source, that is something that will boost

699
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:41,440
your resume once you're applying to formal jobs or traditional jobs.

700
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:47,360
So a lot of folks in a lot of your careers are starting to use GitHub more to verify

701
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,360
your experience.

702
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:54,280
They check out if you have any projects there.

703
00:54:54,280 --> 00:55:01,040
Even that we've heard weird stories of even if your profile looks like professional-ish,

704
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,360
which that's a very weird thing to say, but I kind of understand what they're meaning.

705
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:14,240
It's like, oh yeah, you don't have a really good profile picture, but definitely the activity

706
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:21,040
that you're doing in GitHub can essentially help you out to make your resume or your profile

707
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,920
outstand from others as you apply for jobs afterwards.

708
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:30,720
I've heard a ton of stories of people getting jobs out of GitHub.

709
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:38,660
So people that become continuous contributors or recurring contributors to open source projects,

710
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,320
they get visibility from other developers.

711
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,840
I mean, if I can get someone that is contributing a lot to an open source project that I'm building

712
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:55,480
my technology from, I would totally send them a message of, hey, are you looking for a job?

713
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,480
I have full transparency of how you work, and I think this is extremely valuable.

714
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,520
So, I really hope, and it's not a hope, I think it's something that we're naturally

715
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:11,000
moving towards too, that first of all, open source offers a democratic way of getting

716
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,320
professional experience in, I would say, its fullest component.

717
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:21,040
Second of all, it can help you get a job, especially if you are getting started in tech

718
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,280
or if you change your careers, making open source contributions and being active in a

719
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,760
way that might bump your resume or your application to a job.

720
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,520
And third, it's a great way to meet really cool people that are doing really cool stuff.

721
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:41,280
And you never know, probably one of them can get you to your next job or your first job

722
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,280
as well.

723
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,280
Yeah, that's great.

724
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,280
100% agree.

725
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,920
Yeah, you've answered all my questions and then some.

726
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,920
So that's great.

727
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,120
I love that.

728
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,640
So I have basically two questions left.

729
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:01,160
And the one is, so we've talked a lot about students and all the opportunities there are

730
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,120
and all the things that getups offer.

731
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:08,240
But as you've worked with all these students and you've seen what works and what doesn't

732
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,960
work and some new trends, maybe that's emerging or anything, is there anything specific advice

733
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,240
you have for educators?

734
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,680
Like are there some things that you've seen that, you know, if you incorporate this into

735
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:28,240
how you teach, it really works well with students and these are things that's kind of like that

736
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,720
doesn't kind of gel with students?

737
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,120
Yeah, no, totally.

738
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:40,560
I think educators in particular are, we put a lot of responsibility on their hands.

739
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,880
Like they don't only have to create a lot of the curricula, they also need to, I would

740
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,640
say it's kind of like a performance art, right?

741
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,600
Like you need to engage people and keep them excited about what they're learning.

742
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,920
But also you need to teach them.

743
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,040
So it's like, it's not only kind of like watching a TV show on whatever platform, but it's also

744
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:03,000
how do you make sure that people really kind of like understand what I'm talking about

745
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,960
and they can take that into something useful afterwards.

746
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:13,040
And they also need to review and give comments and feedback to all the work that students

747
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,040
are doing.

748
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:20,920
My thing with teachers is that sometimes, especially for some schools that, well, I

749
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:27,000
think it's across multiple institutions, but teachers do a lot of work.

750
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,400
The best piece of advice that I would give is that they're not alone.

751
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:36,960
Like there's a ton of other teachers there that are looking forward to sharing what they

752
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,680
have done.

753
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:44,000
From the GitHub side, we have the GitHub campus advisors and we have a private GitHub discussion

754
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
with all the teachers.

755
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,720
And it has been really cool because they share some of their resources.

756
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:56,080
So for example, if a teacher has done an intro to algorithms and data structures course on

757
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,280
GitHub, they will share, sometimes they will share, depending on the college, because some

758
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,800
colleges really kind of like protect their property, but some of them are very cool and

759
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,080
they share their resources with other teachers.

760
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,060
So if you're giving the same class, you already have the content.

761
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:20,920
So you only need to worry about the performance part of your job.

762
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,120
On the other side, I think there's very small things that you can do to make sure that people

763
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,760
really engage with your classroom.

764
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:35,240
In our case, I know it sounds like it's not a lot, but with GitHub, you're able to, if

765
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,840
you reach out to GitHub, please do it for a teacher.

766
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,340
We would love to help you.

767
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,840
But we send like a swag back to teachers.

768
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:49,960
With Mona stickers and with Octocad stickers, Mona is our mascot for folks who probably

769
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,960
haven't heard that before.

770
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,840
We send them like cheat sheets and a lot of other resources that they can use while they're

771
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,480
teaching.

772
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,200
And it turns out that the impact of these small resources, like the cheat sheet is by

773
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,320
far one of the most used tool because you have like all the Git commands that probably

774
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,000
you will be using in one single piece of paper.

775
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,280
It's kind of like these very small things when we support students that do a ton of

776
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,760
impact on their experience managing classrooms.

777
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,760
So reach out to us.

778
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:25,760
We would love to help.

779
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,480
And I think the most important is that you're not alone.

780
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,880
There's a lot of other teachers that are in the same journey as you are.

781
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,240
If you're just getting started, I would recommend reaching out and talking with teachers that

782
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,480
have more experience learning from them.

783
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,720
And I think there's some really great resources there for teachers to take.

784
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,400
I think as a whole, you have a very important job.

785
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,560
You're preparing the next generation and we want to make sure that you have all the tools

786
01:00:54,560 --> 01:01:01,560
that you need to do that the best way possible.

787
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:07,880
Stories from campus advisors, we've heard some really beautiful stories.

788
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,880
We have help.

789
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:14,200
I'm talking about Mexico a lot because I'm from Mexico, so I have a really good communication

790
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
with them.

791
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:23,200
But we sent a swag pack to a teacher in an indigenous school in Guerrero, which indigenous

792
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,720
schools unfortunately are very under-resourced in the country.

793
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:34,160
And for them, the fact that they got the stickers and the chichits was life-changing for the

794
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,360
students.

795
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,280
They were very excited about the classroom afterwards.

796
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,880
They were really engaged with the teacher and the teacher has a huge round of applause

797
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,960
to that teacher because he is teaching a technology that is in another language to folks that

798
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,240
speak in one of the multiple indigenous languages in the country.

799
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,760
And they're building some absolutely amazing things and they send us a photo every quarter

800
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,520
of a project that they build and you can always see the students with their GitHub stickers

801
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,440
and feeling very proud of that.

802
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,640
And I think that's like a super heartwarming story.

803
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,320
But yeah, it's like the small things count a lot, I think, with teachers and there's

804
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,640
been a lot of movement in the last two years of how we teach and this is like the right

805
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:26,600
time for us or what we've noticed as well is that this is the right time to reconnect

806
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:32,440
with the students, especially if you have the ability to have them there in person.

807
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,640
It's a great time to reconnect and really build these trust relations with students.

808
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,400
Being a teacher is much more than just like teaching.

809
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:47,720
You're like a psychologist, a therapist, you are everything, content creator.

810
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:52,760
So I don't know, I'm just like very astonished with everything that they do.

811
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,080
Yeah, that's beautiful.

812
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,480
Well this was awesome and there's so many good things shared here.

813
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:04,520
I only have one closing question for you and that is, what is the best piece of advice

814
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,960
that you've ever received?

815
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:16,880
I think the best piece of advice that I've received is, it's a great question.

816
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:24,960
I think, so I'm going to give some context because I was building, before I joined GitHub,

817
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,640
I was building like a hack fund in Mexico and it was so hard because it was when hack

818
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,280
funds were not like a thing.

819
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:39,920
So when we went to like sponsors, our companies to sponsor us, they were like, oh, but what's

820
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,920
a hack fund?

821
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,920
Are you going to hack the bank?

822
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,920
We laugh at that right now, right?

823
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,480
But at that time it was like, okay, I expect that they don't know what this is all about

824
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,680
and it was so hard.

825
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,760
It was so hard to raise funds to do the work that we wanted to do.

826
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:05,080
And a friend of mine told me that if it was easy, anybody would be able to make it.

827
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:10,920
And it's like, you know, when you're going through some hardship on your job or your

828
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,320
work or something, it's like, you know, if you're one of the few that has the ability

829
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,720
to do it, it's because like it's not easy, like it's going to be challenging sometimes

830
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,360
to do the work that we do.

831
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:25,400
And I think that for me was like, yeah, that makes sense.

832
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:30,720
Like it's, we're the first ones doing that, we're doing that at the time.

833
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,280
People have tried in the past, but didn't work out successfully and I was like, okay,

834
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,280
that do make sense.

835
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:41,320
So yeah, I think that's my best piece of advice.

836
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,200
Yeah, that's great advice.

837
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,320
And that's for sure.

838
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,320
You can see it everywhere.

839
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:52,840
Nobody wants to be the first because it's hard to be the first to do something.

840
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,440
Even if it's just a variation on what somebody else has already done, it's always hard to

841
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,440
be the first one.

842
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:04,000
You see it in these online conferences, like the chat is really quiet until the first person

843
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,720
posts the, hey, welcome everybody.

844
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,460
Suddenly it starts rolling.

845
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:13,560
So it's like that thing, like everybody finds it hard to be the first.

846
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:19,720
So if you're the first to do X in your community or in your country, then know it's going to

847
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,880
be hard, but it's probably going to be worth it at the same time.

848
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,160
So I think it's great advice and yeah, people should definitely take that to heart.

849
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,160
Thanks so much, Juan.

850
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,160
This was a wonderful conversation.

851
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:36,560
I'm so glad this happened and I'm so excited to share this with the community.

852
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,560

853
