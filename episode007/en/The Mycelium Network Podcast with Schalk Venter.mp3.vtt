Welcome to the Marseillean Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.680 --> 00:09.800
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.800 --> 00:10.800
Hey, Skulk.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.160
Thanks for joining me today.

00:13.160 --> 00:16.360
It's kind of strange because I'm Skulk too.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.360
How are you today?

00:17.360 --> 00:18.360
All right.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.400
A bit rough, to be honest.

00:21.400 --> 00:29.920
So my 10 month old daughter decided that it's the ideal time to start the teething process

00:29.920 --> 00:32.520
in the middle of us moving houses.

00:32.520 --> 00:39.880
So apart from me sitting between boxes and furniture here, I think I have about a half

00:39.880 --> 00:40.880
an hour sleep in.

00:40.880 --> 00:41.880
Yeah.

00:41.880 --> 00:47.720
But it comes with the territory.

00:47.720 --> 00:48.720
That's true.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.720
That's true.

00:49.720 --> 00:53.920
I've not had the best sleep in the last while as well for different reasons.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.360
We've had a bit of the COVID on everybody in our house.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
Yikes.

00:58.360 --> 01:03.920
It's kind of still recuperating and it seems like my wife got it for a second turn, so

01:03.920 --> 01:04.920
that's fine.

01:04.920 --> 01:05.920
Yeah.

01:05.920 --> 01:10.800
I've had it twice as well, so I can sympathize.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.040
Yeah, for sure.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.720
It's not something you want.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.400
That's for sure.

01:16.400 --> 01:24.920
So we know each other from random interactions related to CodeBridge and the Zatech Slack

01:24.920 --> 01:28.720
and some open source hack days and stuff like that.

01:28.720 --> 01:34.920
I've read up a bit about you on your website and stuff on the open up page.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.200
There's some things on the open up page that I found really interesting that I want us

01:38.200 --> 01:39.280
to dig in a little bit.

01:39.280 --> 01:45.480
But before we do that, if you could just give us a whirlwind introduction to your background,

01:45.480 --> 01:47.880
how you got to be on today.

01:47.880 --> 01:48.880
Okay.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.320
So introduction from my side.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.320
Oh, I don't know.

01:52.320 --> 01:58.080
I think for me, I always start with the...

01:58.080 --> 02:03.200
I think it's important in terms of context for me, just in terms of my own journey and

02:03.200 --> 02:07.960
so forth, is that I don't have a formal background in tech.

02:07.960 --> 02:13.880
I like many other people my age that are in tech and specifically at the specific intersections

02:13.880 --> 02:17.720
where I am, didn't actually study this.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.000
We kind of ended up here by accident.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.320
I think that's also maybe one of the reasons why I also find myself in the spaces that

02:27.320 --> 02:35.560
I do because I think for me, tech and things around the tech industry and so forth have

02:35.560 --> 02:42.920
always been things that I've made sense of through conversation instead of actually studying

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
it.

02:43.920 --> 02:50.760
I think I've been very a part of communities and meetup and so forth in the early days

02:50.760 --> 02:55.680
in terms of just actually figuring out how to build websites and whatever.

02:55.680 --> 03:02.120
And I think once I actually, I guess, hit a point where I could maybe call myself a

03:02.120 --> 03:08.800
professional in this space, I think I just didn't stop joining meetups and stuff.

03:08.800 --> 03:14.000
I just kept on going and I think I'm still part of a lot of those communities today.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.120
I mean, you're behind FedSA, Zatech, ZAProductDesign and CodeBridge.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.120
That's a lot.

03:22.120 --> 03:25.720
I don't know if it's going to make it any better, but at the moment I'm not actively

03:25.720 --> 03:30.040
involved in CodeBridge, so at least I have that going for me.

03:30.040 --> 03:39.160
So it's down to like three at the very least, but yeah, obviously I was very involved there

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
for a long time.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.160
I kind of ran it as well.

03:42.160 --> 03:50.120
I obviously know a lot of the people there, but just because where life takes one and

03:50.120 --> 03:57.560
so forth and I'm currently quite a way away in terms of distance from like actual CodeBridge

03:57.560 --> 04:05.640
itself, the venues, and with the current petrol prices and stuff, yeah, it's a bit of a tough

04:05.640 --> 04:06.640
one.

04:06.640 --> 04:11.000
So I'm not actively involved there at the moment, but yeah, obviously kind of still

04:11.000 --> 04:13.400
pop in every now and then, yeah.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.240
Would you mind explaining a little bit about what exactly CodeBridge is?

04:17.240 --> 04:18.240
Phew.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.240
Okay.

04:19.240 --> 04:24.160
I think that is something we've been trying to answer for a very long time.

04:24.160 --> 04:29.520
So I can speak to obviously like kind of my experience when I was kind of like actively

04:29.520 --> 04:35.880
managing it and so forth, but I obviously don't want to speak on behalf of JD and the

04:35.880 --> 04:40.280
rest of the team who kind of are running it at the moment.

04:40.280 --> 04:47.880
But I think when I was there, it originally started out, so I think between me and JD,

04:47.880 --> 04:54.560
we definitely had a very big interest in what you would, I guess, call civic technology.

04:54.560 --> 05:00.760
So effectively the intersection between technology and kind of civil engagement and social good

05:00.760 --> 05:08.160
and NPOs and civil society and so forth, because I think we were quite frustrated in terms

05:08.160 --> 05:16.640
of just, I think the ventures that we saw where you had civil society or nonprofits

05:16.640 --> 05:22.960
or so forth, where they kind of ventured into the world of tech and tried exploring solutions

05:22.960 --> 05:26.400
within the world of tech.

05:26.400 --> 05:36.640
I think in terms of just the outcomes that we just saw, it was very, I think, demoralizing.

05:36.640 --> 05:41.200
So I think we wanted to create a space where we could have those discussions in terms of

05:41.200 --> 05:50.360
like, how can you actually leverage technology for social good, because everyone comes to

05:50.360 --> 05:57.120
the discussion in terms of, okay, we're going to use blockchain and AI to solve world hunger.

05:57.120 --> 06:05.200
But I think if you've spent any time within the space, you'll just know that is not only

06:05.200 --> 06:13.000
pretty much unachievable, but it's also like, even if you were to solve social problems

06:13.000 --> 06:20.040
or have some type of social good without it actually being connected to something happening

06:20.040 --> 06:26.000
in the real world, it's pretty much not of value to anyone.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.840
I think we had a saying where we used to say that tech, a lot of times tech isn't the solution,

06:32.840 --> 06:35.440
but it shouldn't be the problem.

06:35.440 --> 06:42.080
And I think that is what we saw a lot of times is people started with like the tech, they

06:42.080 --> 06:48.780
took tech as a kind of a given, and then they try to work their way backwards and figure

06:48.780 --> 06:53.680
out how can they employ this for some type of social good instead of starting at the

06:53.680 --> 06:59.880
actual need and then deciding on the tech that you employ and so forth based on that.

06:59.880 --> 07:04.520
But yeah, so honestly, it's a very hard question to answer because I think it just came from

07:04.520 --> 07:10.900
a place of being dissatisfied with kind of how tech was being leveraged in the space

07:10.900 --> 07:13.040
of civil society and social good and so forth.

07:13.040 --> 07:20.280
And just being tired of seeing nonprofits pay thousands of rands for a basic WordPress

07:20.280 --> 07:24.060
website that falls over within a month.

07:24.060 --> 07:28.280
So I think it was just a general open space to explore those intersections.

07:28.280 --> 07:38.040
But I think at some point, it started growing into developing other facets as well.

07:38.040 --> 07:45.440
So just like general mentoring and people just connecting on tech projects and so forth.

07:45.440 --> 07:54.120
So I think some of that specific focus, I think started getting diluted at a later point,

07:54.120 --> 08:00.280
which isn't necessarily a bad thing, because at the end of the day, I think the goal was

08:00.280 --> 08:02.000
to keep it an inclusive space.

08:02.000 --> 08:10.400
So demanding that we kind of all work towards a specific mission that we dictate was kind

08:10.400 --> 08:13.120
of a bit against the founding principles.

08:13.120 --> 08:17.080
So yeah, it's to this day, still a very hard question to answer.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.800
No, I totally get that.

08:19.800 --> 08:28.280
I ran a, well, I tried to run a similar kind of program called Third World Problems.

08:28.280 --> 08:36.960
I had the idea initially was also to employ tech to solve world problems.

08:36.960 --> 08:41.840
But I quickly realized, especially as soon as I started doing some research, I realized

08:41.840 --> 08:47.440
exactly what you said is you first need to understand the problems and then you need

08:47.440 --> 08:51.120
to decide whether tech is the right thing to solve that problem.

08:51.120 --> 08:58.040
And that was actually, as is often the case, the hardest part was clearly identifying a

08:58.040 --> 09:02.160
need that was really, that is kind of why the project fizzled out.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.320
Unfortunately, I'm trying to resurrect it again.

09:04.320 --> 09:09.920
But the reason it fizzled out is because people that would be interested in it would be interested

09:09.920 --> 09:15.560
in the code, you know, making an app that can do something.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.560
And that's great.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.720
That enthusiasm, I mean, you need those people.

09:18.720 --> 09:25.160
But before you do that, you need to understand the concrete problem and what the people on

09:25.160 --> 09:27.520
the ground really need.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.000
Do they need technology or do they need bread?

09:31.000 --> 09:35.400
You know, like it's fine to have an app, but if you're hungry, the app's not going to help

09:35.400 --> 09:41.800
you unless it's going to help you know how to grow your own food and how as a community

09:41.800 --> 09:43.800
becomes self-sustainable.

09:43.800 --> 09:49.080
And the app or the technology helps you achieve that.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.080
Great.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.800
But the technology is not the key part of that, of that part.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.080
And that's why I think that's why that project kind of fizzled out because again, it's this

09:57.080 --> 10:01.340
why does Third World Problems, hard to say.

10:01.340 --> 10:05.380
It's about Third World Problems, but the real Third World Problems, not the jokingly stuff

10:05.380 --> 10:10.060
that people say like, oh, First World Problems, you know, not in that joking sense of that,

10:10.060 --> 10:14.640
like the true Third World Problems that people face in the real world.

10:14.640 --> 10:22.360
And I think that kind of leads to a quote, I think from you that is on the open up website,

10:22.360 --> 10:28.120
where you made three points and they are attempting to make sense of the bigger South African

10:28.120 --> 10:34.120
socio-economic picture, cultivating very practices that interrogate my own position and understanding

10:34.120 --> 10:37.640
how the latter should stand in relation to the former.

10:37.640 --> 10:41.280
I really love that and I'd like it if you can unpack that a little bit.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.280
Oh, sure.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.520
Like, I wrote that a long time ago.

10:45.520 --> 10:49.200
Having someone else read it back to me, you're not going to lie, it sounds pretentious.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.920
But yeah, let's work with it.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.600
Yeah, so I think it's also just like in terms of just due diligence and so forth.

10:56.600 --> 11:01.480
I think it's important for me to just also note that, you know, I'm not a full-time employee

11:01.480 --> 11:04.080
of open up at this point anymore.

11:04.080 --> 11:09.800
I do contract work, I mostly do full-time freelance work.

11:09.800 --> 11:18.120
But yeah, like I think that the time I spent at open up was a very formative time in my

11:18.120 --> 11:19.120
kind of life.

11:19.120 --> 11:25.460
And I think it very much formed a lot of the ideas that I have and how I kind of see myself

11:25.460 --> 11:28.720
as someone in the field of tech.

11:28.720 --> 11:29.720
Cool.

11:29.720 --> 11:38.160
So sure, like in terms of that, yeah, like it's like if I were to kind of relate my like

11:38.160 --> 11:44.120
where I'm today, I think like back when I joined the open up team, that was very much

11:44.120 --> 11:50.320
something that I, you know, like I spent a lot of time thinking about.

11:50.320 --> 11:59.600
I think for me, as mentioned, I don't necessarily have a tech, a formal tech background.

11:59.600 --> 12:06.120
I would say that I'm self-taught, but with two caveats, the key being that everyone kind

12:06.120 --> 12:12.200
of working at this within like in the web space in 2022 at my age are self-taught because

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
you cannot study it.

12:13.200 --> 12:18.840
You could maybe study Java or you could study graphic design, which included something called

12:18.840 --> 12:19.840
web design.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.040
But that was, you kind of did a website the same way that you did a flyer or a brochure

12:24.040 --> 12:25.040
or whatever.

12:25.040 --> 12:30.160
That's the notion of, you know, like, I mean, like CSS wasn't really even a thing when I

12:30.160 --> 12:31.160
studied.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.160
So yeah.

12:32.160 --> 12:39.320
But I think like over time and, you know, so I've been involved, I've increasingly been

12:39.320 --> 12:42.040
moving into kind of spaces.

12:42.040 --> 12:47.320
I think you reach a point where you almost get tired of building things yourself and

12:47.320 --> 12:51.880
you're more interested in seeing what other people build and what they are doing.

12:51.880 --> 12:58.800
So I'm spending more time actually working with others in terms of helping them figure

12:58.800 --> 13:01.080
out how to build the things they want to build.

13:01.080 --> 13:06.160
And also like people that are looking for like mentorship or whatever, or who are trying

13:06.160 --> 13:09.720
to kind of upskill or kind of learn these skills and so forth.

13:09.720 --> 13:16.600
And so as part of that, I was, I was very involved at one for one year, maybe it was

13:16.600 --> 13:20.360
kind of just when COVID hit, was it, I think 2020.

13:20.360 --> 13:26.440
I was very involved in a project called Codex, which is based in Harrington Street in Cape

13:26.440 --> 13:27.440
Town.

13:27.440 --> 13:34.920
And yeah, so it's run by, by a guy called Andre and, and, and Cara, who's like they,

13:34.920 --> 13:40.080
the two of them run it and like, sure, they, they just like inspirational people.

13:40.080 --> 13:47.080
I would, I think like, I would highly recommend you just speak to them as well on the podcast.

13:47.080 --> 13:53.760
And so the goal there was to take people who didn't necessarily have the same opportunities

13:53.760 --> 14:04.440
that I or any of the people at Codex had, but are interested in like kind of figuring

14:04.440 --> 14:09.720
out if they can create a career in, in the tech world.

14:09.720 --> 14:15.120
So effectively, you know, these would be people from like kind of the bottom of the LSM scale,

14:15.120 --> 14:16.120
you know?

14:16.120 --> 14:20.640
Like a lot of these people didn't even have internet at home.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.680
And like, and I think there's a really good, like, like a interesting intersection there

14:24.680 --> 14:28.640
where, you know, like there's a massive demand for tech skills.

14:28.640 --> 14:33.480
I think if you even look at just like recruiters and even a business model like AlphaZen, like

14:33.480 --> 14:38.760
that, that wouldn't work in any other industry just because there's such a big demand.

14:38.760 --> 14:43.160
And then like in South Africa, we have this massive problem of unemployment.

14:43.160 --> 14:49.080
So I think a lot of people are asking questions around, can you maybe use tech to like this

14:49.080 --> 14:54.080
specific, this massive demand for tech skills to maybe make a bit of a dent in that massive,

14:54.080 --> 14:58.960
I think we're like, like youth unemployment, I think we're above 50%.

14:58.960 --> 14:59.960
You know?

14:59.960 --> 15:08.400
So yeah, so I think, like, so I think that like kind of, so I joined the Codex team with

15:08.400 --> 15:09.400
that in mind.

15:09.400 --> 15:18.040
And, you know, and so we kind of definitely, so I took a group of girls and we got a lot

15:18.040 --> 15:23.800
of funding from the Google Foundation and kind of I taught them a lot of skills that

15:23.800 --> 15:28.680
like related to kind of building web apps and stuff, kind of doing a lot of work with

15:28.680 --> 15:31.640
web components, doing a lot of work with React.

15:31.640 --> 15:36.280
I think a lot of them are employed today as React developers.

15:36.280 --> 15:43.440
But I think I also like, it was also a very big learning experience for me because there's

15:43.440 --> 15:49.200
a lot of things that I took for granted in terms of if I say, you know, I'm self-taught,

15:49.200 --> 15:55.160
there's a lot of privilege that I had in my life that made that journey very easy for

15:55.160 --> 15:56.160
me.

15:56.160 --> 16:06.240
It's just basic things in terms of like having a degree, although it's not a degree in tech,

16:06.240 --> 16:11.080
but like being able to have gone and studied at the university, like definitely like it

16:11.080 --> 16:17.240
teaches you some really great like abstract thinking skills.

16:17.240 --> 16:23.720
And I often find that with these type of programs, it's very easy to teach someone like HTML,

16:23.720 --> 16:27.560
you know, you do this and this is how you make the thing blue, JavaScript, you do this

16:27.560 --> 16:29.480
and when you click the button, this happens.

16:29.480 --> 16:34.960
But I think once you get into the kind of the more complex stuff, you know, like in

16:34.960 --> 16:40.920
terms of things like encapsulation, you know, like APIs and architecture and those type

16:40.920 --> 16:49.480
of things, it's like there's a level of abstract thinking that I have had the privilege of

16:49.480 --> 16:55.600
being taught in for a very long time in my life, starting, you know, from like having

16:55.600 --> 17:02.040
the opportunity to go to a pretty decent high school, you know, by general standards, you

17:02.040 --> 17:07.640
know, it's not a public school, but like in terms of just the general South African socioeconomic

17:07.640 --> 17:12.400
circumstances, like sure, it's definitely within like kind of when you're talking about

17:12.400 --> 17:17.320
like the average, I had a phenomenal education.

17:17.320 --> 17:23.560
And I think so like that is how like if I were to contextualize the points that you

17:23.560 --> 17:30.600
mentioned around what I said when I joined Open Up is like I think that has been kind

17:30.600 --> 17:35.080
of where my journey has been going post Open Up.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.560
I think at Open Up I very much looked at it through the lens of how can we use tech to

17:39.560 --> 17:46.920
make things better for people that don't necessarily have the same privilege that I have.

17:46.920 --> 17:55.800
And I think increasingly now I'm kind of exploring more avenues in terms of like how can I maybe

17:55.800 --> 18:02.720
use like what I've been able to learn over the years and maybe help other people kind

18:02.720 --> 18:10.480
of learn those skills maybe was less of the pain that I had to in terms of just like not

18:10.480 --> 18:16.080
knowing anything about like even agile processes or anything, you know, missing deadlines,

18:16.080 --> 18:21.360
having to work through the night because I couldn't estimate like properly or just like

18:21.360 --> 18:29.720
completely just like missing like how to even architect projects or whatever.

18:29.720 --> 18:38.320
And I think so currently as I'm speaking at this point I'm kind of at a place called Codespace.

18:38.320 --> 18:46.720
It was originally created by Emma Dix, which she founded Code for Cape Town, which specifically

18:46.720 --> 18:53.520
looked at empowering, so they started out with kind of a program in Kailicha, which

18:53.520 --> 18:56.240
is one of the informal settlements in Cape Town.

18:56.240 --> 19:01.360
And they kind of also like specifically with a focus on some of the girls, they're kind

19:01.360 --> 19:06.040
of teaching them like, you know, basic tech skills and tech literacies and so forth.

19:06.040 --> 19:10.080
And that kind of evolved into teaching them programming and so forth.

19:10.080 --> 19:17.600
And now they're actually running a full like remote program, which is based on kind of

19:17.600 --> 19:19.720
like an income share agreement.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.280
So anyone can apply.

19:22.280 --> 19:26.480
You don't pay anything to say it's a one year software engineering program that I'm currently

19:26.480 --> 19:29.280
running for them.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.920
So anyone can apply.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.320
And she's just like you go through an application process because obviously you want to weed

19:35.320 --> 19:42.280
out people that aren't really that interested, but they just don't know what else to do.

19:42.280 --> 19:47.680
And effectively, you get an entire year's worth of training in everything from, you

19:47.680 --> 19:55.640
know, like HML, CSS to like full on like JavaScript, you know, like full stack JavaScript from,

19:55.640 --> 20:02.880
you know, all the major frameworks to like Node, like even like AWS, like cloud functions,

20:02.880 --> 20:03.880
all of that stuff.

20:03.880 --> 20:10.560
So really like almost a kind of a full on like JavaScript engineering program with like

20:10.560 --> 20:13.160
HML and CSS.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.400
And yeah, effectively you don't pay.

20:16.400 --> 20:23.760
And then if you do get a job after you've studied, then you retroactively pay a portion

20:23.760 --> 20:30.560
of kind of what you would have paid as fees as a part of the percentage of your salary.

20:30.560 --> 20:36.480
So I think that's a really great model and it's one of the reasons why I've come a lot

20:36.480 --> 20:41.560
involved with them apart from just like really enjoying working with the team.

20:41.560 --> 20:47.600
I definitely think specifically in a time now where there are just like around every

20:47.600 --> 20:53.280
corner there's like a boot camp trying to cash in on this, trying to cash in on this,

20:53.280 --> 20:57.580
you know, everyone wanting to get into development and so forth.

20:57.580 --> 21:03.400
So I think having a model like that is really great and I think it keeps everyone accountable

21:03.400 --> 21:08.760
because at the end of the day, I'm not getting paid if my students aren't placed because

21:08.760 --> 21:13.640
I effectively get paid a percentage of their salary.

21:13.640 --> 21:20.880
So yeah, like I think like that is kind of, if I were to connect that statement with where

21:20.880 --> 21:25.000
I'm currently in in my life, I think that is kind of the area that's most applicable.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Yeah, that's great.

21:27.000 --> 21:34.360
I know there's a school in school or a movement in the US that has a similar approach to how

21:34.360 --> 21:35.920
you pay.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.000
I always blank on their name for some reason, but I'll remember and put a link in the show

21:40.000 --> 21:41.240
notes to that.

21:41.240 --> 21:46.280
Is it the one that specifically works with refugees and...

21:46.280 --> 21:54.200
No, no, not specifically, no, no, because like I always blank on that one's name as

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
well.

21:55.200 --> 22:02.040
I have an actual, I have a friend Douglas who's actually doing work for them.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.480
But yeah, like it's, there's amazing stuff going on.

22:04.480 --> 22:12.960
I think back in the days when I was very involved with CodeBridge, we also had like a couple

22:12.960 --> 22:20.600
of people down from a UK based kind of, I also wouldn't say bootcamp, maybe like incubator

22:20.600 --> 22:26.080
maybe called Coders and Founders, where they also kind of do the same type of thing, but

22:26.080 --> 22:27.960
with the goal of not necessarily.

22:27.960 --> 22:32.960
So I think with the code space stuff, we're specifically trying to get people into tech

22:32.960 --> 22:40.440
careers, whereas with Coders and Founders, and I think a similar equivalent in South

22:40.440 --> 22:45.480
Africa would be WeThinkCode, for whom I've also done a bit of work, where they maybe

22:45.480 --> 22:51.080
like they see the tech skills as a way for you to kind of create your own startup.

22:51.080 --> 22:55.120
And so you're not specifically looking to get hired in the tech field, you're actually

22:55.120 --> 22:58.560
learning tech skills with the goal of creating your own business.

22:58.560 --> 23:02.160
Yeah, there's a lot of, there's a lot of super exciting stuff going on there.

23:02.160 --> 23:09.000
And I honestly, I have to, I have to kind of exercise a bit of respect because like,

23:09.000 --> 23:16.400
you know, I just like, I just find it so inspiring, so exciting that, like, if I don't, like,

23:16.400 --> 23:20.480
I'm just going to get involved in everything and burn myself out.

23:20.480 --> 23:27.200
And like, and you probably know, like, also, like the, just the kind of, like, when you

23:27.200 --> 23:32.320
have to compare that to actual salaries of working in tech, you also kind of take a bit

23:32.320 --> 23:39.640
of it, which to me isn't that big of a deal, but now that I have a daughter, it's maybe

23:39.640 --> 23:44.440
not that easy, easy anymore for me to just say, no, it's all right, like I can live on

23:44.440 --> 23:45.440
passion alone.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.440
Yeah, yeah, very true, very true.

23:46.440 --> 23:51.960
Yeah, that does change the game, but yeah, there's a lot of people who make it work,

23:51.960 --> 23:52.960
nonetheless.

23:52.960 --> 23:58.080
I'm exactly in the same boat, I mean, the reason I started the Mycelium Network is not

23:58.080 --> 24:06.440
necessarily to benefit me directly, it's literally I want to share my knowledge and connect people

24:06.440 --> 24:12.520
who want to get into code for whatever reason they have with people who can help them.

24:12.520 --> 24:18.320
Because again, I was also privileged, of course, in my opportunities, but some of the things

24:18.320 --> 24:24.040
I did, I made kind of a bold move, I mean, before I started when I started contracting

24:24.040 --> 24:32.120
at Mozilla, I had a full-time paying job working for a contracting agency, and I was placed

24:32.120 --> 24:36.520
at Vodacom, and I was earning a decent salary and getting medical aid and all that stuff.

24:36.520 --> 24:41.440
But I wasn't happy doing the work, the work to me was meaningless, so that it was literally,

24:41.440 --> 24:45.280
I couldn't care less about what I was building.

24:45.280 --> 24:51.360
And I always had this thing with Mozilla and their manifesto and stuff like that, and being

24:51.360 --> 24:54.760
built in open source, those things connected very well for me.

24:54.760 --> 24:59.640
And at some point I decided, you know what, if I don't kind of just take the plunge, I'm

24:59.640 --> 25:00.800
probably never going to do it.

25:00.800 --> 25:05.760
And I actually resigned before actually having the job at Mozilla, and I had a family at

25:05.760 --> 25:06.760
that point.

25:06.760 --> 25:16.960
So it was scary, it worked out, so looking back at how I'm like, wow, I took a massive

25:16.960 --> 25:24.000
chance there, but it all worked out in the end.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
But I want to create those opportunities for other people to also take a leap sometimes,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.560
a leap of faith, and not be scared to fail.

25:32.560 --> 25:38.800
Because in the world we live in today, there's so many mantras about failing, but then when

25:38.800 --> 25:45.240
it comes to social media, you dare not show your failures until you are very successful,

25:45.240 --> 25:47.320
and then you can speak about your failures.

25:47.320 --> 25:52.400
But while you're still climbing the ladder and some of the rungs break under you, don't

25:52.400 --> 25:54.320
tell anybody about that, keep it quiet.

25:54.320 --> 25:59.560
And I think that should be normalized.

25:59.560 --> 26:05.120
Doesn't matter where you are in your career or your path or whatever you want to call

26:05.120 --> 26:10.080
it, it's always okay to fail, and it's always okay to get up and try again.

26:10.080 --> 26:15.080
It's also okay to try a thing and find it's not for you and move on to something else.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.720
The tech industry isn't for everybody.

26:17.720 --> 26:24.480
It's also been sold to people in different ways, and sometimes falsities are being sold

26:24.480 --> 26:25.480
to people.

26:25.480 --> 26:33.240
There's almost Utopia is sold, which isn't always the case.

26:33.240 --> 26:36.760
Even sometimes if you do stuff that you're passionate about, sometimes there's just stuff

26:36.760 --> 26:43.200
that's just work, and you just kind of have to grind your teeth and just get through it.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.040
No, a hundred percent.

26:46.040 --> 26:53.440
I have the same thing with the front-end development South Africa stuff at the moment, where effectively

26:53.440 --> 27:02.080
it's a nonprofit that I and a very good friend of mine, Justin Slack, kind of founded specifically

27:02.080 --> 27:08.680
for kind of just advocating for front-end development and creating resources and connecting

27:08.680 --> 27:13.600
practitioners in South Africa within the world of front-end development.

27:13.600 --> 27:19.920
I almost want to say it's kind of been too successful in so far that now we need to do

27:19.920 --> 27:26.360
a lot of stuff that actual real nonprofits need to do, like auditing and actually doing

27:26.360 --> 27:32.000
operations, keeping track of where money is going, actually getting funding, bringing

27:32.000 --> 27:34.520
contractors on board and so forth.

27:34.520 --> 27:39.320
I always kind of miss the days when it was just me and him kind of just like cowboying

27:39.320 --> 27:42.680
it, and that's exactly the same.

27:42.680 --> 27:48.120
Obviously the part that I doing the finances is definitely I'm doing the taxes and whatever

27:48.120 --> 27:54.000
and auditing is obviously the part I enjoy the least, but at the end of the day in terms

27:54.000 --> 28:00.120
of just value, that is I guess where I can provide the most value.

28:00.120 --> 28:05.600
I think there's also a part of I think sometimes a lot of specifically in the open source world,

28:05.600 --> 28:10.400
I think a lot of it is sometimes romanticized a bit.

28:10.400 --> 28:20.360
And yeah, like let me just put it this way, so you spoke about Zetatech and I might regret

28:20.360 --> 28:27.080
mentioning this, but I guess it's so thematically relevant at the moment.

28:27.080 --> 28:36.600
So last week, maybe two weeks ago, some of the admins on there actually got a personally

28:36.600 --> 28:43.920
addressed letter from someone's lawyers threatening civil litigation because we banned them from

28:43.920 --> 28:44.920
Zetatech.

28:44.920 --> 28:45.920
Wow.

28:45.920 --> 28:46.920
Yeah.

28:46.920 --> 28:55.000
So I think that is kind of the type of stuff you sometimes need to deal with, especially

28:55.000 --> 29:01.400
like within the world of open source as well, with CodeBridge as well, a lot of the time

29:01.400 --> 29:08.560
it's just actually managing humans and personalities that don't get along and whatever.

29:08.560 --> 29:14.240
I think there's an inherent messiness to being involved in these type of things.

29:14.240 --> 29:23.120
I think the fact that I can't even really say what CodeBridge actually was definitively

29:23.120 --> 29:25.840
there's a messiness to that.

29:25.840 --> 29:31.960
And I think specifically us in the tech world who are so used to clean code and debugging

29:31.960 --> 29:39.920
things and efficiency, sometimes that messiness is quite hard for us to stomach because we

29:39.920 --> 29:45.880
want to understand, we want to know what it is, we want answers.

29:45.880 --> 29:51.040
And sometimes that messiness gives us kind of the same feeling that, for example, something

29:51.040 --> 29:54.960
like spaghetti code might give us.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.000
But in real life, you kind of need that messiness.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.160
You can't have everything just clean and perfectly laid out.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.520
That is very true.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.640
I was just having a look here.

30:08.640 --> 30:14.640
I'm reading this book about program management of open source projects.

30:14.640 --> 30:19.440
And there's this quote that I think is kind of relevant to what you just said.

30:19.440 --> 30:24.240
They say as a program manager, you coordinate the efforts of the contributor community to

30:24.240 --> 30:26.200
meet the project's goals.

30:26.200 --> 30:30.480
The title Chief Cat Herding Officer is a joke, but an apt one.

30:30.480 --> 30:36.500
You're working with a group of largely of entirely composed volunteers to produce software

30:36.500 --> 30:38.840
that other people will want to use.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.600
Individually, contributors have their own interests and goals.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.520
When you're a successful program manager, you get these individuals aligned in the same

30:45.520 --> 30:49.560
general direction to meet overall goals of the community.

30:49.560 --> 30:52.000
That was so well put to me.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.120
I'm reading a really great book at the moment.

30:56.120 --> 30:59.280
It's been recommended to me quite a bit, and I finally got down to reading it.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.000
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
It's called The Goal.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.120
No, I haven't read it.

31:04.120 --> 31:09.440
So it's kind of very widely shared within the agile community.

31:09.440 --> 31:21.320
It's actually a novel, but it's a novel about a factory manager and the factory on the verge

31:21.320 --> 31:26.960
of getting shut down and then them trying to figure out how to save the factory and

31:26.960 --> 31:28.040
so forth.

31:28.040 --> 31:34.300
As part of that, they kind of like, yeah, obviously, I don't want to obviously lay out

31:34.300 --> 31:41.360
the entire plot of the book, but as part of that, they come to some insights around just

31:41.360 --> 31:49.680
the nature of projects and things like dependencies and estimations and so forth.

31:49.680 --> 32:00.040
But I think the fact that having it packaged as a novel to me is such a great way of communicating

32:00.040 --> 32:06.720
that because obviously, there's a lot of great books on these type of things, like Lean Startup

32:06.720 --> 32:10.760
and all of those books.

32:10.760 --> 32:16.560
But I think now for me, as I'm reading this book and looking at it through the lens of

32:16.560 --> 32:18.440
a novel of someone who's...

32:18.440 --> 32:23.320
It's also like kind of his marriage is falling apart and whatever.

32:23.320 --> 32:31.320
So kind of seeing the processes and all these things around how do you actually develop

32:31.320 --> 32:32.520
in your career?

32:32.520 --> 32:34.640
How do you actually manage a team?

32:34.640 --> 32:36.600
How do you do all these things?

32:36.600 --> 32:42.160
I think sometimes we forget all of that happens as a microcosm in this larger thing that is

32:42.160 --> 32:47.040
just our lives in general and everyone else's lives.

32:47.040 --> 32:55.520
So in that, you're dealing with personal things and you're having issues with family and you're

32:55.520 --> 32:58.320
getting burnt out.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.600
For me, I'm very open about my own struggles.

33:01.600 --> 33:06.280
I have a pretty long history with mental illness as well.

33:06.280 --> 33:11.720
So I'm pretty open and I wish I could talk about that more.

33:11.720 --> 33:17.920
But sometimes when I try to kind of always be open about it, but sometimes I feel that

33:17.920 --> 33:26.120
sometimes people feel sometimes it's a bit shoehorned into conversations.

33:26.120 --> 33:34.160
And I think I was maybe overcorrecting a bit in terms of people not talking about it.

33:34.160 --> 33:39.720
But that's tough for me, but that's almost like an entire podcast episode on itself.

33:39.720 --> 33:49.200
I have a blog on Medium where I openly write about my struggles with substance abuse because

33:49.200 --> 33:53.280
of mental health problems, anxiety, stuff like this.

33:53.280 --> 33:58.520
So I very much understand all of this.

33:58.520 --> 34:04.840
And the thing that I realized at some point is why do I want to compartmentalize my life

34:04.840 --> 34:07.320
into these buckets?

34:07.320 --> 34:14.520
Why do I feel the need to have that writing as open and honest as it is, be separate from

34:14.520 --> 34:19.400
that stuff I write about tech?

34:19.400 --> 34:24.240
It's almost as if I'm saying that it should be normalized and people shouldn't be afraid

34:24.240 --> 34:25.520
to talk about these things.

34:25.520 --> 34:34.080
But then I compartmentalize and I kind of, don't look there, that's personal.

34:34.080 --> 34:46.160
And so it's super uncomfortable, but I am making a concerted effort to not do that.

34:46.160 --> 34:50.640
Maybe I will have the blog separate on Medium because the audience that will benefit from

34:50.640 --> 34:57.120
that is there, so it makes sense, but I won't hide from linking to it or talking about it

34:57.120 --> 35:02.040
or mentioning it in a thing, which previously I would probably avoid.

35:02.040 --> 35:07.520
Like I, for example, would have like a coffee thing and then I would have one that's like

35:07.520 --> 35:11.800
for my personal and then one for my, oh, this is my professional.

35:11.800 --> 35:15.780
And I realized that the reason I'm doing that is because of this whole thing that social

35:15.780 --> 35:18.120
media is driving you towards.

35:18.120 --> 35:23.060
It's saying no, when you're in the public eye, like whatever that is, five people looking

35:23.060 --> 35:28.720
at you or 5,000, doesn't matter, your human nature kicks in in the same way.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.760
You have to put your best foot forward.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.280
And admitting that you have struggles is not that.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.320
It's like I just said about the failure thing.

35:37.320 --> 35:42.080
You can talk about failure once you've succeeded, but once you haven't succeeded, I'm putting

35:42.080 --> 35:47.480
it in quotes, you're not allowed to talk about your failures because then you just look weak.

35:47.480 --> 35:48.480
And that's nonsense.

35:48.480 --> 35:55.840
I mean, show me a person whose life has gone just peach perfect, like from day one up to

35:55.840 --> 35:56.840
the day they are now.

35:56.840 --> 35:57.840
We all have struggles.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.180
And I think the more we talk about that, the better.

36:00.180 --> 36:04.640
And I think people will be more okay with also understanding.

36:04.640 --> 36:11.280
I found that personally, if you're open about these things, people are more willing to like,

36:11.280 --> 36:14.680
you know, come meet you in the middle, so to speak.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.120
They're more understanding if you're open about it.

36:17.120 --> 36:20.600
And of course, you're going to find people who are not like that.

36:20.600 --> 36:27.040
But I think for the most part, you're going to be surprised by people's reaction when

36:27.040 --> 36:28.040
you're actually honest.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.920
Yeah, and I think about that quite a lot.

36:30.920 --> 36:39.800
And sometimes I wonder whether I'd be as open about these things if once again, you know,

36:39.800 --> 36:47.720
like I guess, so I explicitly on my LinkedIn profile, you know, so I think I have a front

36:47.720 --> 36:55.080
end development, product design, teaching, and destigmatizing mental illness.

36:55.080 --> 37:02.040
And I sometimes wonder if I would be this open about it if, you know, if, you know,

37:02.040 --> 37:11.080
I wasn't, what would be the word, if the tech industry wasn't so, didn't have as many opportunities.

37:11.080 --> 37:14.080
Like I'm struggling to kind of figure out how to phrase it now.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.280
I know what you're trying to say though, yeah.

37:16.280 --> 37:17.280
Yeah.

37:17.280 --> 37:20.880
So if it was a bit more of a competitive like kind of industry, and you know, there was

37:20.880 --> 37:27.760
a shortage of work or whatever, specifically within the tech world, like anyone, like if

37:27.760 --> 37:33.120
you are slightly above intermediate level, you are very in demand.

37:33.120 --> 37:40.760
So I think sometimes I wonder whether I would have like been as open about it if I knew

37:40.760 --> 37:46.600
that, you know, I was struggling to get work and, you know, like there was very few positions

37:46.600 --> 37:52.320
out there and anything that can be used against you, like would be used against you.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.320
Yeah.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.320
Yeah.

37:54.320 --> 37:58.520
But like, I don't know, like maybe let's see in 10 years, things might change.

37:58.520 --> 38:01.200
I might be like, that was a really big mistake.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.960
Like I shouldn't have been as public about it.

38:03.960 --> 38:09.400
But I think for now, like I've been, I've been managing somewhat well, I've been managing

38:09.400 --> 38:13.480
very well while at the same time being open about kind of like all my personal struggles

38:13.480 --> 38:14.480
and so forth.

38:14.480 --> 38:15.480
Yeah.

38:15.480 --> 38:19.840
And I actually did a very interesting like talk.

38:19.840 --> 38:26.880
So I was asked by some of the, so some of the folks at Deriel.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.920
So they sometimes have speakers come and chat to the team.

38:29.920 --> 38:36.040
And I, so I think they, at some point we're looking for someone to chat about mental health.

38:36.040 --> 38:41.600
And I've been promising myself that I would do an actual real talk on it at some point,

38:41.600 --> 38:43.920
and not just like mention it as an aside.

38:43.920 --> 38:48.080
So I kind of just volunteer to do it.

38:48.080 --> 38:54.140
And I think specifically, like I actually spent a lot of time talking and reflecting

38:54.140 --> 39:04.200
on how much I've actually learned about kind of being human just from like getting deeper

39:04.200 --> 39:07.640
into the world of product design.

39:07.640 --> 39:12.320
And I think I really resonate with what you're saying about, you know, failure and so forth.

39:12.320 --> 39:18.240
But I think it's even more, it's actually not necessarily even failure, but I think

39:18.240 --> 39:26.200
it's being able to understand things and like being able to articulate that failure.

39:26.200 --> 39:31.000
I think when you're in the, like, and I think within the world of product design as well,

39:31.000 --> 39:37.560
you know, there's often a saying that it's not necessarily that you're scared that someone

39:37.560 --> 39:40.640
isn't going to be receptive to your idea.

39:40.640 --> 39:46.760
You're scared that you're not going to do your idea justice if you share it too early.

39:46.760 --> 39:51.600
So if you push that MVP out too early, maybe you're like, okay, cool, we should have actually

39:51.600 --> 39:54.320
just done this and it wouldn't have failed.

39:54.320 --> 39:59.960
So like it's more a thing about like missed opportunity or not being able to express the

39:59.960 --> 40:03.520
actual value of something early on.

40:03.520 --> 40:08.880
And I find it to be the same as well with kind of discussions around failure and just

40:08.880 --> 40:10.960
general experience and so forth.

40:10.960 --> 40:14.960
And I think it ties into what you said that, you know, if you can reflect back and you

40:14.960 --> 40:20.640
can very nicely articulate and make sense of what was going on, you know, and frame

40:20.640 --> 40:25.920
it in terms of a bigger journey, that's a lot easier to do than when you're in the thick

40:25.920 --> 40:28.920
of it and it's confusing and it's messy and you don't know what's going on.

40:28.920 --> 40:34.080
You don't even know if it's a failure, but you're just, you don't, it's this blob and

40:34.080 --> 40:36.280
you don't know how to make sense of it.

40:36.280 --> 40:44.040
I think that's when it's hard and being vulnerable at that moment, I think is very hard.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.440
But I think like I've kind of learned a lot from the world of product design specifically

40:47.440 --> 40:52.640
in that regards, because there's a lot of similarities there in terms of actually pushing

40:52.640 --> 40:58.200
a product out and not actually even really knowing what it is or what value it provides

40:58.200 --> 41:02.300
and wanting to hold back all the time and be like, okay, let's just refine it a little

41:02.300 --> 41:03.300
bit more.

41:03.300 --> 41:07.160
It needs a bit more polish.

41:07.160 --> 41:11.360
And like, I think even if you think about things like extreme programming and so forth,

41:11.360 --> 41:18.120
you know, so one of the core principles of extreme programming is which, you know, Agile

41:18.120 --> 41:23.040
kind of grew out of the world of extreme programming and so forth is courage.

41:23.040 --> 41:31.640
So and yeah, so I think there's a lot within this field and I think it's almost like the

41:31.640 --> 41:37.560
tech field is almost, I think, pushing humans to like, I guess, the edge of what they're

41:37.560 --> 41:41.480
comfortable dealing with complexity wise.

41:41.480 --> 41:46.000
And because of that, it's actually bringing up a lot of stuff in you in terms of uncertainty

41:46.000 --> 41:50.240
and, you know, like people talk a lot about imposter syndrome.

41:50.240 --> 41:57.080
Yes, and but like, specifically, it's a big thing in the tech industry.

41:57.080 --> 42:02.480
But like, I think sometimes we don't ask like, why is it so big in the tech world?

42:02.480 --> 42:07.840
Why isn't many people talk about imposter syndrome amongst plumbers or farmers or, you

42:07.840 --> 42:10.000
know, nurses?

42:10.000 --> 42:15.440
And I think it's just because, like, what we are required to do in the world of tech

42:15.440 --> 42:27.520
is so kind of straining in terms of emotionally for us and like, our capabilities and yeah,

42:27.520 --> 42:32.440
like I often joke and I say that, you know, as you get more senior kind of the imposter

42:32.440 --> 42:37.520
syndrome kind of starts going away, but and it's not because you get better, but you just

42:37.520 --> 42:43.600
realize like how like bad everything else is out there, that you kind of realize, yeah,

42:43.600 --> 42:46.280
you know, I didn't know much and whatever.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.320
But no one else knows anything.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.320
Exactly.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.320
Yeah.

42:50.320 --> 42:55.880
So it's like, I mean, look at look at look at kind of that incident with WhatsApp and

42:55.880 --> 43:02.800
Facebook with the DNS, like, like, I'll always remember the date, because it's the date my

43:02.800 --> 43:04.960
daughter was born.

43:04.960 --> 43:10.880
So and so, like everyone was like, so we couldn't send anyone any WhatsApp messages or anything

43:10.880 --> 43:14.520
or any photos or whatever, because WhatsApp was down.

43:14.520 --> 43:18.680
Yeah, what a day for WhatsApp to go down.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.080
Yeah, exactly.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.080
Yeah, exactly.

43:21.080 --> 43:26.800
So but like, I think like that just kind of shows you as well, you know, like it's like,

43:26.800 --> 43:34.040
I think like, at some point, you just realize just like how, like, with prayers and sticky

43:34.040 --> 43:42.200
tape, and, you know, just how, how kind of just held together ad hoc most of these things

43:42.200 --> 43:47.920
are and how people are just kind of just getting by in terms of what they actually understand

43:47.920 --> 43:50.160
and what they can actually do.

43:50.160 --> 43:54.240
And how the complexity of the things we're building far out seed actually our abilities

43:54.240 --> 43:57.360
to manage it.

43:57.360 --> 44:00.960
And I think that kind of that kind of makes the some of the imposter syndrome kind of

44:00.960 --> 44:01.960
fizzle away.

44:01.960 --> 44:05.600
You just realize everyone else really sucks at this as well.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.600
Yeah.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.600
Yeah.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.080
No, that's very true.

44:09.080 --> 44:17.400
And I think people also oftentimes underestimate how understanding your users can be.

44:17.400 --> 44:22.280
You know, if something doesn't quite work, they'll find a way around it or they'll they'll

44:22.280 --> 44:23.280
try again.

44:23.280 --> 44:29.320
There's very few instances with your everyday like website or application where somebody

44:29.320 --> 44:34.760
is going to make a huge fuss about the fact that the button didn't quite react in the

44:34.760 --> 44:35.760
way it was.

44:35.760 --> 44:42.240
Or when I resize my browser window, there was this moment where two things were misaligned.

44:42.240 --> 44:47.680
Like we sweat all that small stuff, but in the real world, honestly, like, first of all,

44:47.680 --> 44:52.920
you run into it all the time because it's humans making these things and we're all fallible.

44:52.920 --> 44:55.440
And the second point, that is not the end of the world.

44:55.440 --> 44:59.480
It's like make your window a little bigger and then it's aligned again if it bothers

44:59.480 --> 45:00.480
you.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.480
Yeah.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.480
It's okay.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.480
No, a hundred percent.

45:03.480 --> 45:08.400
I, both you and I will probably get a lot of hate mail for actually saying this.

45:08.400 --> 45:11.480
But I, I wish it wasn't the case.

45:11.480 --> 45:12.960
Honestly, I wish it wasn't the case.

45:12.960 --> 45:20.440
I wish like, like people would be more outraged at bad experiences on the web.

45:20.440 --> 45:26.640
Cause I think like then if it hurts companies, they would actually put more resources into

45:26.640 --> 45:28.160
it.

45:28.160 --> 45:33.280
And I always tell my students as well, you know, like specifically my design students

45:33.280 --> 45:34.400
that I wish it wasn't the case.

45:34.400 --> 45:41.480
I wish I could tell you that, you know, you need to treat your users with respect.

45:41.480 --> 45:43.560
You know, like it's a very brittle relationship.

45:43.560 --> 45:47.360
If you break their trust, you know, like that's very important.

45:47.360 --> 45:48.800
Like, and I believe all those things.

45:48.800 --> 45:54.920
I wish I could say like that translates also into actually successful business.

45:54.920 --> 46:00.920
But like what I've unfortunately learned over the years is that like, yeah, like I've, I've

46:00.920 --> 46:09.080
just been part of like projects and stuff where things were just like broken and, um,

46:09.080 --> 46:15.160
you know, and somehow like, so people complained on Twitter and they kind of wrote a lot of

46:15.160 --> 46:16.560
angry stuff.

46:16.560 --> 46:20.400
And a year later, like things were just back to the way they were.

46:20.400 --> 46:24.840
Once those issues were resolved, um, you know, like how many times has Woolworths been boycotted

46:24.840 --> 46:25.840
now?

46:25.840 --> 46:32.080
Like how many of those people that boycotted with some company like Woolworths over the

46:32.080 --> 46:34.160
years are now back at Woolworths again.

46:34.160 --> 46:39.440
I wish it wasn't the case, but, um, but at the very least, if anything, it also like

46:39.440 --> 46:48.560
kind of just like eases a bit of the pressure of having to have everything be perfect.

46:48.560 --> 46:57.040
Um, like I think sometimes in terms of companies, it may be like makes for some gross incentives,

46:57.040 --> 47:01.640
but I think as individuals working in this space, um, it's also not the end of the world

47:01.640 --> 47:02.640
if things break.

47:02.640 --> 47:03.640
Yeah.

47:03.640 --> 47:04.640
Yeah, no, for sure.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.240
And I mean, I'm not advocating for doing sloppy work.

47:07.240 --> 47:16.200
It's more a case of, um, doing something right takes time.

47:16.200 --> 47:23.840
And, um, when business interests clash with time, oftentimes, you know, you literally

47:23.840 --> 47:27.700
just don't have the time to do it the way you would like to do it.

47:27.700 --> 47:30.160
And so sometimes you need to make trade-offs.

47:30.160 --> 47:34.300
Um, and that is where I'm talking about, like where the forgiving nature of people will

47:34.300 --> 47:37.960
come in and like, kind of save you from, from those situations.

47:37.960 --> 47:45.360
Cause I mean, if, if we all had product managers or product owners who weren't driven by OKRs

47:45.360 --> 47:50.520
and deadlines and stuff like that, we would build software that is much more resilient.

47:50.520 --> 47:57.160
And, um, you know, it's done better, but sometimes time constraints forces you to, to take shortcuts

47:57.160 --> 47:58.160
unfortunately.

47:58.160 --> 47:59.160
Yeah.

47:59.160 --> 48:05.120
And to me, honestly, I, this is such a hard thing for me and, you know, I'm, I'm kind

48:05.120 --> 48:10.160
of even scared to talk about it because, uh, like I know how a lot of people are going

48:10.160 --> 48:15.440
to react, but, you know, uh, I can just honestly speak about kind of how things look from where

48:15.440 --> 48:17.000
I'm standing.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.000
And I think like I'm someone who's very passionate about accessibility.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.520
I've, I've done several talks on accessibility.

48:22.520 --> 48:29.360
We actually at Frontend Development every year on Global Accessibility Awareness Day,

48:29.360 --> 48:31.440
we do a specific event.

48:31.440 --> 48:38.320
This year we had a phenomenal one, uh, where, um, Brett, um, someone I met at DevConf who's

48:38.320 --> 48:42.680
a, who's a blind front end developer actually did a talk and actually showed how he codes

48:42.680 --> 48:44.400
as a blind developer.

48:44.400 --> 48:55.720
Um, so, but yeah, like I, a lot of, like I'm struggling to find some type of incentive

48:55.720 --> 49:02.640
for companies to really care about accessibility apart from just making them feel bad for not

49:02.640 --> 49:03.640
doing it.

49:03.640 --> 49:08.680
Uh, I think a lot of people would argue that there are, you know, like financial, you can

49:08.680 --> 49:11.080
frame it financially and, and whatever.

49:11.080 --> 49:17.680
And honestly, I think a lot of like business thinking around like business and so forth,

49:17.680 --> 49:22.320
you know, the whole 80-20 rule, you know, 20% of your users account for like 80% of

49:22.320 --> 49:23.320
your kind of value.

49:23.320 --> 49:29.440
Um, you know, like that flies in the face of catering to a smaller percentage, um, that

49:29.440 --> 49:32.980
had like that really require more accessibility.

49:32.980 --> 49:39.920
And I think there's also like, we sometimes get a bit stuck on, um, yeah, I'm just so

49:39.920 --> 49:43.360
scared that I'm just going to say something that I'm going to regret, not necessarily

49:43.360 --> 49:49.440
that I'm withholding anything, but accessibility is such a, such a touchy subject and I'm scared

49:49.440 --> 49:55.440
I'm going to say something that can be misconstrued or come across like in a way that I don't

49:55.440 --> 49:56.440
intend that.

49:56.440 --> 49:59.320
But yeah, it is, it is, it is tough, man.

49:59.320 --> 50:06.160
Like I, you know, like I often find anytime I'm involved in a project where we actually

50:06.160 --> 50:11.320
care about accessibility, it's just because I'm forcing it, it's because I'm in a position

50:11.320 --> 50:16.960
of power and I'm saying that, you know, we're going to do this as a team.

50:16.960 --> 50:20.640
You don't have a choice, otherwise I'm not going to manage this project.

50:20.640 --> 50:28.440
Um, yeah, it's, it's, it's tough and yeah, like that's, that's also, that's a podcast

50:28.440 --> 50:29.440
on its own.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.440
No, for sure.

50:30.440 --> 50:35.080
No, and I mean, it, it, it boils down to the fact that you have to get people to truly

50:35.080 --> 50:36.440
care.

50:36.440 --> 50:41.840
Um, and that is, I don't, it's better, let me, let me be totally honest.

50:41.840 --> 50:47.800
Like, I mean, uh, the tooling around it has improved leaps and bounds and the number of

50:47.800 --> 50:54.080
people that talk about it as growing exponentially, which I love.

50:54.080 --> 51:02.520
But in the end of the day, what's the important thing is, is that people who are not evangelists

51:02.520 --> 51:04.200
care about this.

51:04.200 --> 51:09.000
Like you understand, and I think one of the new ways that it's being framed that I like

51:09.000 --> 51:14.880
is this whole idea of oftentimes when you do something to benefit somebody with, um,

51:14.880 --> 51:19.680
some ability challenges, benefits all your users in the end of the day.

51:19.680 --> 51:24.440
And I think the more we can pull examples out of the real world to demonstrate that,

51:24.440 --> 51:29.320
the more it becomes less of a, I'm doing it for a small percentage of my audience to a,

51:29.320 --> 51:33.480
I'm doing a thing that's going to benefit a small percentage of our audience.

51:33.480 --> 51:37.320
But a turns out it's also going to benefit all the other people as well.

51:37.320 --> 51:42.800
Um, and I think there's more and more of those examples being, uh, highlighted and that,

51:42.800 --> 51:46.240
that changes the conversation because I know for the longest time, the way to talk about

51:46.240 --> 51:48.560
it was, well, you know, you can get sued.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.240
Have you heard about Target?

51:50.240 --> 51:54.840
And I don't know if fear-mongering is the way to get people to care about something.

51:54.840 --> 52:00.320
I would, I would say, like, I would like, you know, I'd actually say I hold the opposite

52:00.320 --> 52:01.320
position.

52:01.320 --> 52:07.040
Like for me, the only, to me, the only, the only real way we're going to get any sort

52:07.040 --> 52:14.080
of traction on this is if there is like financial realities of punishment, uh, for companies.

52:14.080 --> 52:18.560
Because you know, like, like, yeah, I do, I do hear what you're saying.

52:18.560 --> 52:24.400
Um, but like, if I just like look at like how, what a tight ship a lot of companies

52:24.400 --> 52:30.360
are running, you know, um, even just sometimes making it a good experience for the average

52:30.360 --> 52:35.720
user, you know, like the, the completely able-bodied user, like sometimes there's not even enough

52:35.720 --> 52:39.880
like time to actually do that because other features need to be shipped.

52:39.880 --> 52:44.320
And I also have to say, you know, like we can head on companies as much as we want,

52:44.320 --> 52:48.320
but there is a big shortage of developers.

52:48.320 --> 52:55.200
So that usually means that any team won't ever be able to get to all the work that needs

52:55.200 --> 52:56.580
to be done.

52:56.580 --> 53:02.080
So like most teams have positions that have just been open for years and they haven't

53:02.080 --> 53:04.320
folded and they're just short staffed.

53:04.320 --> 53:11.200
Um, so I do think there is a bit of a kind of like, you know, like companies just like,

53:11.200 --> 53:15.320
like having bad incentives, but I also think a lot of it is just like skills, you know,

53:15.320 --> 53:22.840
like, uh, yeah, like, and I think, you know, just in terms of like, and I think specific

53:22.840 --> 53:29.360
in South Africa, I have a theory where, um, in South Africa specifically, I think, I think

53:29.360 --> 53:35.400
we're trying to, to, to combat a lot of that with FATSA is that, and I'm as guilty of this

53:35.400 --> 53:36.400
as well.

53:36.400 --> 53:40.840
I do a lot of international work, um, because, you know, South African companies can't really

53:40.840 --> 53:45.760
compete with the exchange rate, you know, I get paid in pounds and dollars, like, you

53:45.760 --> 53:48.960
know, South African tech company can't really compete.

53:48.960 --> 53:56.400
Um, and so that by nature means once people reach a certain level of seniority, they immediately

53:56.400 --> 54:02.960
start working with like, you know, international teams, um, which is great, but at the end

54:02.960 --> 54:09.640
of the day, what then happens is like the actual, like the actual skills in the actual

54:09.640 --> 54:16.640
pool of people that are working on South African products, um, is, you know, greatly diminished.

54:16.640 --> 54:21.000
Um, and you, you don't have those opportunities for mentorship in South African teams and

54:21.000 --> 54:27.440
so forth, which I'm of the opinion that the South African, you know, like just experience

54:27.440 --> 54:32.320
of using South African products on the web and so forth is, is not at the standard that

54:32.320 --> 54:33.320
it should be.

54:33.320 --> 54:38.320
Like, I think we are South Africans just assume because, you know, it's take a lot or because

54:38.320 --> 54:43.560
it's show max or whatever, we can't hold show max to the same standards as Netflix.

54:43.560 --> 54:48.600
We can't have all take a lot to the same standard as Amazon or whatever, you know?

54:48.600 --> 54:54.520
Um, and like, I, I do think unfortunately it's, it's like, it's a bit self perpetuating

54:54.520 --> 55:00.960
and um, yeah, I would wish if, if, if South Africans were more demanding of kind of the,

55:00.960 --> 55:06.040
the, the experience that they get from actual tech products in South Africa.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.040
Yeah.

55:07.040 --> 55:13.720
Um, do you think, um, this is a general thing in developing countries where, um, essentially

55:13.720 --> 55:19.840
when you reach, when developers reach this level of seniority, you have this, like they

55:19.840 --> 55:21.480
say brain drain.

55:21.480 --> 55:25.760
And so automatically kind of have this knock on effect happening.

55:25.760 --> 55:31.480
And then, yeah, some people are going to get left behind in that, that story, right?

55:31.480 --> 55:34.960
They're never going to, they're never going to reach that seniority because the people

55:34.960 --> 55:37.160
that can help them get their leave.

55:37.160 --> 55:38.160
Yeah.

55:38.160 --> 55:39.160
And, and, you know, and it's interesting.

55:39.160 --> 55:45.280
So, um, like I've actually, actually, actually spoken to Phillip from Office Zen, uh, one

55:45.280 --> 55:48.760
of the co-founders of Office Zen about this quite a lot, because what they're seeing is

55:48.760 --> 55:54.880
they're seeing a lot of, and not only South Africans actually, you know, working for European

55:54.880 --> 55:59.840
companies and so forth post COVID, you know, like, like as the whole world went more remote.

55:59.840 --> 56:04.560
Um, they're also seeing a lot of actual developers from other countries come and work in South

56:04.560 --> 56:07.120
Africa, just because it's a, it's a nice climate.

56:07.120 --> 56:11.160
The cost of living is, you know, like pretty inexpensive and so forth.

56:11.160 --> 56:15.320
And they work with their kind of teams in Silicon Valley or whatever, but they're based

56:15.320 --> 56:17.040
in Cape Town.

56:17.040 --> 56:23.680
And so, like, I think what I, where I stand on that, and when I, some, what I've made

56:23.680 --> 56:29.120
into Phillip as well is that I think there's a danger there in not seeing that as a brain

56:29.120 --> 56:33.760
drain just because people are still physically here.

56:33.760 --> 56:39.560
And what happens is, you know, once again, the actual teams in South Africa, the juniors

56:39.560 --> 56:46.120
in South Africa and, you know, those like working adjacent to developers, uh, you know,

56:46.120 --> 56:52.200
maybe in product design or in tech support or whatever, like they are getting deprived

56:52.200 --> 56:57.320
of a lot of like seniority and opportunities for mentoring and, you know, and so forth.

56:57.320 --> 56:58.320
Yeah.

56:58.320 --> 56:59.440
Um, it's tricky.

56:59.440 --> 57:00.440
It's tricky.

57:00.440 --> 57:04.360
I don't know, but once again, I'm as guilty of this as anyone else.

57:04.360 --> 57:10.760
Um, I have to also say that, you know, unfortunately also, I find that, you know, South African

57:10.760 --> 57:15.600
tech companies don't treat the employees that well, unfortunately.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.440
And that's been my experience as well.

57:17.440 --> 57:23.280
I think specifically as a front end developer, I often feel that South African companies

57:23.280 --> 57:27.240
tend to see front end development as an afterthought.

57:27.240 --> 57:29.200
So like, yeah, it's not a real job.

57:29.200 --> 57:35.440
Yeah, and it's like, you get the designs from the designer and you get the API or not, not

57:35.440 --> 57:40.160
even the API, let's say you're doing PHP templating or whatever, you know, you just write the,

57:40.160 --> 57:42.680
make the CSS fit the design.

57:42.680 --> 57:46.720
Like there's no mention of like design systems or any of that stuff, you know?

57:46.720 --> 57:53.720
Um, so like, so now like you're given, you're given the opportunity to, um, be less respected

57:53.720 --> 57:57.760
and earn less money just out of principle, you know?

57:57.760 --> 58:00.640
So I think at some, at some point, yeah.

58:00.640 --> 58:05.360
So at some point, like even I'm like, you know, so I try and, so there's a company called

58:05.360 --> 58:13.880
Palmetrix that I, um, do like a big, about 50% of my work, um, is for them.

58:13.880 --> 58:20.600
Um, so they're kind of like a seller dashboard for, um, sellers, third party sellers on take

58:20.600 --> 58:21.600
a lot.

58:21.600 --> 58:22.600
Um, yeah.

58:22.600 --> 58:28.720
Um, so, um, yeah, so that is the big, one of the big South African teams that I work

58:28.720 --> 58:29.720
with.

58:29.720 --> 58:35.000
And it's just because also I share a lot of the, um, like there's a lot of overlap in

58:35.000 --> 58:37.400
terms of just like culture and whatever.

58:37.400 --> 58:40.120
So I really enjoy working with the team there.

58:40.120 --> 58:44.900
Um, but like most of my other works international, unfortunately.

58:44.900 --> 58:50.320
So as a teacher, cause I know that's a large part of, of what you do, what do you see the

58:50.320 --> 58:51.320
role of open source?

58:51.320 --> 58:55.480
How does, what role does it play in learning and in teaching?

58:55.480 --> 58:56.480
Hmm.

58:56.480 --> 58:57.480
Sure.

58:57.480 --> 58:58.480
Um, yes.

58:58.480 --> 58:59.480
Okay.

58:59.480 --> 59:05.080
That, that should, that's a tough one.

59:05.080 --> 59:11.960
Um, I can say for one that it isn't playing nearly as big as a role as it should.

59:11.960 --> 59:24.360
Um, I, I still see so many teams that are effectively trying to create their own worst

59:24.360 --> 59:28.480
version of MDN.

59:28.480 --> 59:34.800
I've just encountered so many, like, cause I've seen, I've taught that a lot of places

59:34.800 --> 59:39.960
I've kind of been involved in a lot of programs and so forth and there's an obsession with

59:39.960 --> 59:52.400
creating content and I think in terms of education, we are still like, we're kind of in almost

59:52.400 --> 59:57.800
like we're kind of like, so there's a really great book, um, by the name of info.

59:57.800 --> 59:58.800
We trust.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:04.760
Um, and it talks about, you know, like we, like the information age isn't like on the

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.640
horizon anymore.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.480
We're like, we're like in the shoulder, shoulder depth in it.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:18.120
We're like drowning in information and you know, like, like, and I think indicative of

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.720
that is just like the fact that, you know, most of the big tech companies and then the

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:30.960
most profitable to companies is companies that actually help navigate that just sea

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:38.880
of information, whether it be Google or Facebook or Twitter or whatever, or even Wikipedia.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:44.720
So but I do think a lot of educational programs and a lot of people involved in those programs

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:53.280
are still in a mind, like, like in a, in a, in a information scarcity mindset where they

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.720
think the value that they're providing is giving students content, give like creating

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.920
reading material, creating instructional videos and things for you for, for, and I think one

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:12.080
thing that we've started exploring at code space is, um, I'm obviously going to speak

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.800
a lot about code space because, because that is like where I spend most of my teaching

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.600
time at the moment.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.680
We've started exploring, not creating any new content.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.920
So playing the role of curating content.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:34.000
So sending people to MDN, giving them a list of YouTube videos to watch and so forth.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.760
And thinking about the value we provide a bit differently.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:43.320
Um, I think I draw a lot of inspiration from, um, the Odin project.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.320
You're probably familiar with Odin project.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.320
Yes.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.320
Yeah.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:53.800
So they also tend to take a more of a curation role than an actual creating content role.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.800
Yeah.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.000
Yeah, like does the world really need one more YouTube video on Flexbox?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.160
Um, probably not and probably not with the budget that I have, you know, like I'll just

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:12.820
leave it to actual like high producing streamers to do like a really engaging video on how

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.280
Flexbox works.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.560
So what is the value that I provide then?

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:23.800
And I always start, I always start by asking my students, why are you here instead of just

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.440
doing a 200 rand Udemy course?

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.440
Um, and like they never even actually think about that, but even worse, like why are you

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:39.040
here when you could just be doing free code camp, um, which most of the time has even

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.040
better outcomes than a lot of these boot camps.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:48.680
So I think what we've been trying to do is integrate a lot more of those things.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:57.780
So instead, like actually having students do free code camp in addition to what we provide.

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.960
So instead of seeing something like free code camp or Udemy or whatever, as a competitor

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:09.960
to the training that we provide, seeing how we can maybe play a more curation role in

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:14.440
terms of guiding people in terms of, okay, if I want to go into this, what are things

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.640
worth exploring?

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.720
If I want to build this type of app, what are the stuff I should be looking at?

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.960
What are the, cause there's also a lot of like misinformation out there.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:31.760
Um, like what are the things, you know, should I be using MDN or should I be using W3 schools?

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:39.560
You know, um, most I've, I'm sure I've seen so many programs where they actually use W3

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.160
schools as actual reference.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.160
I'm like, yeah.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:48.480
Okay, I shouldn't probably have said that part out loud, but yeah, like it's pretty

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.920
well known that I'm not a big fan of W3 schools.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:58.560
Um, but yeah, like, so I think to answer your question, what role should open source be

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.560
playing?

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.560
Sure.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.280
I don't know a role at this point.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.880
I don't, I don't think it's playing that much of a role at the moment.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:13.120
Um, we, we just have too many people creating content, too many people building LMSs.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:19.680
Um, when something like GitHub actually has a really solid, like educational platform

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.520
that you can use, yeah.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.040
And you can set it up so it runs automated tests and whatever.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:33.600
Do we really need to be building another Laravel powered like LMS for our specific bootcamp

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.880
or our specific?

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:35.880
Yeah.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:44.360
I think like there's a bit of a mindset change that needs to happen there in terms of relying

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:49.040
more on open source things, relying more on what's out there.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:56.440
And I think there's a bit of fear there in so far that people are scared that that's

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.440
going to make them redundant.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:05.560
Um, yeah, but I, but I, but I also think, you know, I don't know, there's maybe easy

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:12.560
for me to say, but if it makes you redundant, then so be it, you know, um, like would you

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:22.240
rather, would you rather try and stay relevant at the expense of students at the expense

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:28.160
of their, so I told my wife yesterday, sorry, like I just have so many things I can say

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.160
on this topic.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.500
I told my wife yesterday.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:37.640
So like at code space, we for next year, we have an intake of 150 students.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.000
And like, shoo, like that's the biggest intake we've had ever.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.080
And yeah, like, and it's, it's so scary.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:46.080
It's shoo.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:54.680
It's like, you literally have the ability to mess up 150 people's possible career prospects.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.680
Yeah.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.680
That is scary.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.920
So like, but yeah, like that, that's a conversation for another day.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:14.120
Um, but yeah, it's, it's, I just find that, I just find that there's a lot of misidentification

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.720
of the real value that education provides in the information age.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:26.000
Um, I think a lot of, especially a lot of like boot camps and stuff, try and copy what

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.640
universities are doing.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:34.920
Because I think it, they're under the impression they, it's more legit.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:41.520
Universities are quote unquote better than just like some random, but I don't know.

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:46.840
Like as someone who's done a lot of work for universities, like, shoo, like, like the,

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:51.200
the university model is not what you want to be copying and saying this as someone who

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.520
has a, has a master's degree himself and spent seven years studying, um, like I honestly

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:02.560
think like the university model is very flawed in this day and age.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:08.680
Um, and I think we need to do some fundamental rethinking in terms of how we train people.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:19.080
Um, a good friend of mine, um, Candice, um, she works for a company called fourth rev,

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.960
so fourth industrial revolution, uh, revolution.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:33.200
And so they are exploring a lot of these things in terms of how do you do education in a world

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.560
like the one we're in today.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:39.840
And honestly, I don't, I don't necessarily have any good suggestions.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:45.600
I think I can maybe just say like, there's a lot of stuff we're doing really badly.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:51.320
Um, and we should maybe just address them before we actually see how we can improve.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:58.480
Um, just give a, give an average experience like, uh, before we even aim for great.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:04.560
Um, yeah, I'd be here like, like I'd be curious, just, you know, like most people that I speak

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:11.480
to that have some type of training in coding or whatever, like is pretty dissatisfied with

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.520
kind of their bootcamp experience.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520
Yeah.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:21.400
Um, and a lot of them, like this in spite of kind of like the course that they did or

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:25.720
the degree that they got or whatever, um, actually succeed.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:32.560
Um, yeah, so I don't know, like it kind of feels like we don't necessarily have to win

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.560
at this game.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:40.720
Like at this point, we just need to stop scoring like own goals at the very least at the very

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.920
least, just like stop sabotaging ourselves.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:47.520
Let's just like at least stop the, stop the bad stuff and then we can focus on making

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.520
it better.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.160
Yeah, no, I totally agree.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.000
And I think that the duration thing you were talking about, I think that is the missing

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.520
link at the moment.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.040
Everybody that I speak to that's, that's new and starting to learn, it's not like that

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.240
there isn't content out there.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:09.040
There's actually too much, um, and so finding, finding a past through all of that is what

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:14.120
they find much, much more, um, challenging than finding content.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.120
They don't know what to trust.

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.280
They don't know if this person is, is good or not.

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.920
There's different modalities, different ways people learn.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:27.960
And so I think being at the curation space and doing a really good job at that is I think

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.880
much more important right now than just, like you said, creating another version of MDN

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.800
or free code camp or whatever the case may be.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:35.800
Yeah.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.740
But I mean, that's effectively what you're doing here.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:41.680
So instead of doing like, welcome to the Sculpt Nietling stream.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.120
And I'm going to be teaching you about what you need to know as a developer.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:50.420
You're kind of relying on what people are doing out there and what's, what people already

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.800
explored and surfacing that, uh, instead of trying to create stuff.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800
Yeah.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.800
Like, so at the very least you have that going for you.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.800
That's good too.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:09:59.800
Yeah.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.800
That's good.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.800
Cause that was the intent.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.800
From one Sculpt to another.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:05.800
Yeah.

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:08.760
So this was really great.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.480
I think this is a wonderful conversation that is like far reaching and it delved into all

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.120
kinds of things, which I think is really, really interesting and people are going to

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.680
enjoy listening to it.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:21.320
And so in closing, um, Tim Ferriss has this thing at the end of his show that he always

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.840
asks people, if you, if you had a billboard and they're really, really busy street and

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:29.820
you could put a phrase on there for everybody to see, what would that be?

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:36.200
So my question is similar in nature, but then the message would be, what would that message

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.960
be for people that getting into tech?

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:41.960
Okay.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:46.960
Like that would very much depend on what time of day you ask me, uh, or even like what day

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.800
of the week you ask me.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:57.200
So I would probably just default to like whatever I tell my students the most.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:04.120
And I think what I always come back to is that it doesn't need to suck this much.

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:10.520
Like I think a lot of them have an expectation that, you know, they're going to have to work

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.960
through the night.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.640
They're going to have to like, uh, put in all these hours.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:20.400
They're going to have to, like, people are going to have to treat them like crap.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.720
Um, and like, honestly, I, like, I always tell my students, there are teams out there.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.760
There are people out there that are like, I don't want any part of that.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.560
Like if you come and work for us, if you're part of our team, we don't want that.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.120
We're going to, we're going to like actively push you to take care of yourself.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:46.360
And I find that, you know, with my students, a lot of times there's an expectation that

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:52.520
they need to almost like bow down to this hustle culture and they can't be like, I actually

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.400
want to take care of myself.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.480
I actually want to be in a, in a healthy mental state.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.520
I don't want to sacrifice my mental health and like, yeah.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.560
And to me, it's just like, I always tell them like the tech field is just so wide and there's

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:15.720
just so many people doing so many different things that you don't need to settle for something

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:20.400
that you feel is not aligned with your values.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.800
And I think that is one of the, one of the benefits that we have within the tech field

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:30.400
is just because at the moment there's such a big demand.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.960
So you should be able to find something that resonates with you.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:40.200
Don't just like, especially if you're a junior, a junior and you're looking for your first

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.240
job, don't just settle for the first thing that comes along.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:50.240
You, like there is a lot of teams that treat people with respect that value you as a human.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.160
And there's a lot of companies that are forced to do this just because they need developers

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.200
so badly, even if they would have treated you like garbage.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:04.200
So I think that's what I always tell my students is that there's a lot more room out there

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.720
for you to have a better experience than you maybe think there is.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720
Yeah.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.720
I think that's great advice.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.720
Thanks a lot, Skol.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:14.720
This was wonderful.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.520
As I said, thank you for spending your Friday afternoon with me.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.520
Yeah.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.520
It was really great.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.520
Yeah.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:28.640
Now it's back to changing nappies and the bad stuff.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.640
Back to the real world.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:30.640
Yeah.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640
Yeah.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.640
Cool.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.640
Thanks so much.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640
This was really great.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:35.640
Yeah.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.640
I hope we can chat again soon.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.640
Oh, for sure.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.640
Cheers.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640
Cool.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640
Cheers, man.
