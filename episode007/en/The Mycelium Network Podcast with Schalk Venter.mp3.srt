00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome to the Marseillean Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,800
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
Hey, Skulk.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,160
Thanks for joining me today.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,360
It's kind of strange because I'm Skulk too.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
How are you today?

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
All right.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,400
A bit rough, to be honest.

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,920
So my 10 month old daughter decided that it's the ideal time to start the teething process

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,520
in the middle of us moving houses.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,880
So apart from me sitting between boxes and furniture here, I think I have about a half

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
an hour sleep in.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
Yeah.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,720
But it comes with the territory.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
That's true.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
That's true.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,920
I've not had the best sleep in the last while as well for different reasons.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,360
We've had a bit of the COVID on everybody in our house.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Yikes.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,920
It's kind of still recuperating and it seems like my wife got it for a second turn, so

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
that's fine.

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Yeah.

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,800
I've had it twice as well, so I can sympathize.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,040
Yeah, for sure.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,720
It's not something you want.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,400
That's for sure.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,920
So we know each other from random interactions related to CodeBridge and the Zatech Slack

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,720
and some open source hack days and stuff like that.

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,920
I've read up a bit about you on your website and stuff on the open up page.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,200
There's some things on the open up page that I found really interesting that I want us

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,280
to dig in a little bit.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,480
But before we do that, if you could just give us a whirlwind introduction to your background,

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,880
how you got to be on today.

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Okay.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
So introduction from my side.

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Oh, I don't know.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,080
I think for me, I always start with the...

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,200
I think it's important in terms of context for me, just in terms of my own journey and

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,960
so forth, is that I don't have a formal background in tech.

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,880
I like many other people my age that are in tech and specifically at the specific intersections

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,720
where I am, didn't actually study this.

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,000
We kind of ended up here by accident.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,320
I think that's also maybe one of the reasons why I also find myself in the spaces that

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:35,560
I do because I think for me, tech and things around the tech industry and so forth have

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,920
always been things that I've made sense of through conversation instead of actually studying

46
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
it.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,760
I think I've been very a part of communities and meetup and so forth in the early days

48
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,680
in terms of just actually figuring out how to build websites and whatever.

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,120
And I think once I actually, I guess, hit a point where I could maybe call myself a

50
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,800
professional in this space, I think I just didn't stop joining meetups and stuff.

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,000
I just kept on going and I think I'm still part of a lot of those communities today.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,120
I mean, you're behind FedSA, Zatech, ZAProductDesign and CodeBridge.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
That's a lot.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,720
I don't know if it's going to make it any better, but at the moment I'm not actively

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,040
involved in CodeBridge, so at least I have that going for me.

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:39,160
So it's down to like three at the very least, but yeah, obviously I was very involved there

58
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
for a long time.

59
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
I kind of ran it as well.

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:50,120
I obviously know a lot of the people there, but just because where life takes one and

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,560
so forth and I'm currently quite a way away in terms of distance from like actual CodeBridge

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:05,640
itself, the venues, and with the current petrol prices and stuff, yeah, it's a bit of a tough

63
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
one.

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,000
So I'm not actively involved there at the moment, but yeah, obviously kind of still

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,400
pop in every now and then, yeah.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,240
Would you mind explaining a little bit about what exactly CodeBridge is?

67
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Phew.

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Okay.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,160
I think that is something we've been trying to answer for a very long time.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,520
So I can speak to obviously like kind of my experience when I was kind of like actively

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,880
managing it and so forth, but I obviously don't want to speak on behalf of JD and the

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,280
rest of the team who kind of are running it at the moment.

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,880
But I think when I was there, it originally started out, so I think between me and JD,

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,560
we definitely had a very big interest in what you would, I guess, call civic technology.

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,760
So effectively the intersection between technology and kind of civil engagement and social good

76
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:08,160
and NPOs and civil society and so forth, because I think we were quite frustrated in terms

77
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:16,640
of just, I think the ventures that we saw where you had civil society or nonprofits

78
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,960
or so forth, where they kind of ventured into the world of tech and tried exploring solutions

79
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,400
within the world of tech.

80
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:36,640
I think in terms of just the outcomes that we just saw, it was very, I think, demoralizing.

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,200
So I think we wanted to create a space where we could have those discussions in terms of

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:50,360
like, how can you actually leverage technology for social good, because everyone comes to

83
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,120
the discussion in terms of, okay, we're going to use blockchain and AI to solve world hunger.

84
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,200
But I think if you've spent any time within the space, you'll just know that is not only

85
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:13,000
pretty much unachievable, but it's also like, even if you were to solve social problems

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,040
or have some type of social good without it actually being connected to something happening

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,000
in the real world, it's pretty much not of value to anyone.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,840
I think we had a saying where we used to say that tech, a lot of times tech isn't the solution,

89
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,440
but it shouldn't be the problem.

90
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,080
And I think that is what we saw a lot of times is people started with like the tech, they

91
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,780
took tech as a kind of a given, and then they try to work their way backwards and figure

92
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,680
out how can they employ this for some type of social good instead of starting at the

93
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,880
actual need and then deciding on the tech that you employ and so forth based on that.

94
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,520
But yeah, so honestly, it's a very hard question to answer because I think it just came from

95
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,900
a place of being dissatisfied with kind of how tech was being leveraged in the space

96
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,040
of civil society and social good and so forth.

97
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:20,280
And just being tired of seeing nonprofits pay thousands of rands for a basic WordPress

98
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,060
website that falls over within a month.

99
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,280
So I think it was just a general open space to explore those intersections.

100
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:38,040
But I think at some point, it started growing into developing other facets as well.

101
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:45,440
So just like general mentoring and people just connecting on tech projects and so forth.

102
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:54,120
So I think some of that specific focus, I think started getting diluted at a later point,

103
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,280
which isn't necessarily a bad thing, because at the end of the day, I think the goal was

104
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,000
to keep it an inclusive space.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,400
So demanding that we kind of all work towards a specific mission that we dictate was kind

106
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,120
of a bit against the founding principles.

107
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,080
So yeah, it's to this day, still a very hard question to answer.

108
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,800
No, I totally get that.

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:28,280
I ran a, well, I tried to run a similar kind of program called Third World Problems.

110
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:36,960
I had the idea initially was also to employ tech to solve world problems.

111
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,840
But I quickly realized, especially as soon as I started doing some research, I realized

112
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,440
exactly what you said is you first need to understand the problems and then you need

113
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,120
to decide whether tech is the right thing to solve that problem.

114
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,040
And that was actually, as is often the case, the hardest part was clearly identifying a

115
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,160
need that was really, that is kind of why the project fizzled out.

116
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,320
Unfortunately, I'm trying to resurrect it again.

117
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,920
But the reason it fizzled out is because people that would be interested in it would be interested

118
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,560
in the code, you know, making an app that can do something.

119
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
And that's great.

120
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,720
That enthusiasm, I mean, you need those people.

121
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,160
But before you do that, you need to understand the concrete problem and what the people on

122
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,520
the ground really need.

123
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,000
Do they need technology or do they need bread?

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,400
You know, like it's fine to have an app, but if you're hungry, the app's not going to help

125
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,800
you unless it's going to help you know how to grow your own food and how as a community

126
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
becomes self-sustainable.

127
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,080
And the app or the technology helps you achieve that.

128
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Great.

129
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,800
But the technology is not the key part of that, of that part.

130
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,080
And that's why I think that's why that project kind of fizzled out because again, it's this

131
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,340
why does Third World Problems, hard to say.

132
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,380
It's about Third World Problems, but the real Third World Problems, not the jokingly stuff

133
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,060
that people say like, oh, First World Problems, you know, not in that joking sense of that,

134
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,640
like the true Third World Problems that people face in the real world.

135
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:22,360
And I think that kind of leads to a quote, I think from you that is on the open up website,

136
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,120
where you made three points and they are attempting to make sense of the bigger South African

137
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,120
socio-economic picture, cultivating very practices that interrogate my own position and understanding

138
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,640
how the latter should stand in relation to the former.

139
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,280
I really love that and I'd like it if you can unpack that a little bit.

140
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
Oh, sure.

141
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,520
Like, I wrote that a long time ago.

142
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,200
Having someone else read it back to me, you're not going to lie, it sounds pretentious.

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,920
But yeah, let's work with it.

144
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,600
Yeah, so I think it's also just like in terms of just due diligence and so forth.

145
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,480
I think it's important for me to just also note that, you know, I'm not a full-time employee

146
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,080
of open up at this point anymore.

147
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,800
I do contract work, I mostly do full-time freelance work.

148
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:18,120
But yeah, like I think that the time I spent at open up was a very formative time in my

149
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
kind of life.

150
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,460
And I think it very much formed a lot of the ideas that I have and how I kind of see myself

151
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,720
as someone in the field of tech.

152
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Cool.

153
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:38,160
So sure, like in terms of that, yeah, like it's like if I were to kind of relate my like

154
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,120
where I'm today, I think like back when I joined the open up team, that was very much

155
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,320
something that I, you know, like I spent a lot of time thinking about.

156
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:59,600
I think for me, as mentioned, I don't necessarily have a tech, a formal tech background.

157
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,120
I would say that I'm self-taught, but with two caveats, the key being that everyone kind

158
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,200
of working at this within like in the web space in 2022 at my age are self-taught because

159
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
you cannot study it.

160
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,840
You could maybe study Java or you could study graphic design, which included something called

161
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
web design.

162
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,040
But that was, you kind of did a website the same way that you did a flyer or a brochure

163
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
or whatever.

164
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,160
That's the notion of, you know, like, I mean, like CSS wasn't really even a thing when I

165
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
studied.

166
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
So yeah.

167
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,320
But I think like over time and, you know, so I've been involved, I've increasingly been

168
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,040
moving into kind of spaces.

169
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,320
I think you reach a point where you almost get tired of building things yourself and

170
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,880
you're more interested in seeing what other people build and what they are doing.

171
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,800
So I'm spending more time actually working with others in terms of helping them figure

172
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,080
out how to build the things they want to build.

173
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,160
And also like people that are looking for like mentorship or whatever, or who are trying

174
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,720
to kind of upskill or kind of learn these skills and so forth.

175
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,600
And so as part of that, I was, I was very involved at one for one year, maybe it was

176
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,360
kind of just when COVID hit, was it, I think 2020.

177
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,440
I was very involved in a project called Codex, which is based in Harrington Street in Cape

178
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Town.

179
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,920
And yeah, so it's run by, by a guy called Andre and, and, and Cara, who's like they,

180
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,080
the two of them run it and like, sure, they, they just like inspirational people.

181
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:47,080
I would, I think like, I would highly recommend you just speak to them as well on the podcast.

182
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,760
And so the goal there was to take people who didn't necessarily have the same opportunities

183
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:04,440
that I or any of the people at Codex had, but are interested in like kind of figuring

184
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,720
out if they can create a career in, in the tech world.

185
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,120
So effectively, you know, these would be people from like kind of the bottom of the LSM scale,

186
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
you know?

187
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,640
Like a lot of these people didn't even have internet at home.

188
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,680
And like, and I think there's a really good, like, like a interesting intersection there

189
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,640
where, you know, like there's a massive demand for tech skills.

190
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,480
I think if you even look at just like recruiters and even a business model like AlphaZen, like

191
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,760
that, that wouldn't work in any other industry just because there's such a big demand.

192
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,160
And then like in South Africa, we have this massive problem of unemployment.

193
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:49,080
So I think a lot of people are asking questions around, can you maybe use tech to like this

194
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,080
specific, this massive demand for tech skills to maybe make a bit of a dent in that massive,

195
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,960
I think we're like, like youth unemployment, I think we're above 50%.

196
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
You know?

197
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:08,400
So yeah, so I think, like, so I think that like kind of, so I joined the Codex team with

198
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
that in mind.

199
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:18,040
And, you know, and so we kind of definitely, so I took a group of girls and we got a lot

200
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,800
of funding from the Google Foundation and kind of I taught them a lot of skills that

201
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,680
like related to kind of building web apps and stuff, kind of doing a lot of work with

202
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,640
web components, doing a lot of work with React.

203
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,280
I think a lot of them are employed today as React developers.

204
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,440
But I think I also like, it was also a very big learning experience for me because there's

205
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,200
a lot of things that I took for granted in terms of if I say, you know, I'm self-taught,

206
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:55,160
there's a lot of privilege that I had in my life that made that journey very easy for

207
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
me.

208
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:06,240
It's just basic things in terms of like having a degree, although it's not a degree in tech,

209
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,080
but like being able to have gone and studied at the university, like definitely like it

210
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,240
teaches you some really great like abstract thinking skills.

211
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,720
And I often find that with these type of programs, it's very easy to teach someone like HTML,

212
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,560
you know, you do this and this is how you make the thing blue, JavaScript, you do this

213
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,480
and when you click the button, this happens.

214
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,960
But I think once you get into the kind of the more complex stuff, you know, like in

215
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,920
terms of things like encapsulation, you know, like APIs and architecture and those type

216
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:49,480
of things, it's like there's a level of abstract thinking that I have had the privilege of

217
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,600
being taught in for a very long time in my life, starting, you know, from like having

218
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,040
the opportunity to go to a pretty decent high school, you know, by general standards, you

219
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,640
know, it's not a public school, but like in terms of just the general South African socioeconomic

220
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,400
circumstances, like sure, it's definitely within like kind of when you're talking about

221
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,320
like the average, I had a phenomenal education.

222
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,560
And I think so like that is how like if I were to contextualize the points that you

223
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,600
mentioned around what I said when I joined Open Up is like I think that has been kind

224
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,080
of where my journey has been going post Open Up.

225
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,560
I think at Open Up I very much looked at it through the lens of how can we use tech to

226
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:46,920
make things better for people that don't necessarily have the same privilege that I have.

227
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:55,800
And I think increasingly now I'm kind of exploring more avenues in terms of like how can I maybe

228
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:02,720
use like what I've been able to learn over the years and maybe help other people kind

229
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:10,480
of learn those skills maybe was less of the pain that I had to in terms of just like not

230
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,080
knowing anything about like even agile processes or anything, you know, missing deadlines,

231
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,360
having to work through the night because I couldn't estimate like properly or just like

232
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,720
completely just like missing like how to even architect projects or whatever.

233
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:38,320
And I think so currently as I'm speaking at this point I'm kind of at a place called Codespace.

234
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:46,720
It was originally created by Emma Dix, which she founded Code for Cape Town, which specifically

235
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,520
looked at empowering, so they started out with kind of a program in Kailicha, which

236
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,240
is one of the informal settlements in Cape Town.

237
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,360
And they kind of also like specifically with a focus on some of the girls, they're kind

238
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,040
of teaching them like, you know, basic tech skills and tech literacies and so forth.

239
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,080
And that kind of evolved into teaching them programming and so forth.

240
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,600
And now they're actually running a full like remote program, which is based on kind of

241
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,720
like an income share agreement.

242
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,280
So anyone can apply.

243
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,480
You don't pay anything to say it's a one year software engineering program that I'm currently

244
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
running for them.

245
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,920
So anyone can apply.

246
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,320
And she's just like you go through an application process because obviously you want to weed

247
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,280
out people that aren't really that interested, but they just don't know what else to do.

248
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,680
And effectively, you get an entire year's worth of training in everything from, you

249
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:55,640
know, like HML, CSS to like full on like JavaScript, you know, like full stack JavaScript from,

250
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:02,880
you know, all the major frameworks to like Node, like even like AWS, like cloud functions,

251
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
all of that stuff.

252
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:10,560
So really like almost a kind of a full on like JavaScript engineering program with like

253
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,160
HML and CSS.

254
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,400
And yeah, effectively you don't pay.

255
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:23,760
And then if you do get a job after you've studied, then you retroactively pay a portion

256
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,560
of kind of what you would have paid as fees as a part of the percentage of your salary.

257
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,480
So I think that's a really great model and it's one of the reasons why I've come a lot

258
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,560
involved with them apart from just like really enjoying working with the team.

259
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,600
I definitely think specifically in a time now where there are just like around every

260
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,280
corner there's like a boot camp trying to cash in on this, trying to cash in on this,

261
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,580
you know, everyone wanting to get into development and so forth.

262
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:03,400
So I think having a model like that is really great and I think it keeps everyone accountable

263
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,760
because at the end of the day, I'm not getting paid if my students aren't placed because

264
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,640
I effectively get paid a percentage of their salary.

265
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,880
So yeah, like I think like that is kind of, if I were to connect that statement with where

266
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm currently in in my life, I think that is kind of the area that's most applicable.

267
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yeah, that's great.

268
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,360
I know there's a school in school or a movement in the US that has a similar approach to how

269
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,920
you pay.

270
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,000
I always blank on their name for some reason, but I'll remember and put a link in the show

271
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,240
notes to that.

272
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,280
Is it the one that specifically works with refugees and...

273
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:54,200
No, no, not specifically, no, no, because like I always blank on that one's name as

274
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
well.

275
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,040
I have an actual, I have a friend Douglas who's actually doing work for them.

276
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,480
But yeah, like it's, there's amazing stuff going on.

277
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:12,960
I think back in the days when I was very involved with CodeBridge, we also had like a couple

278
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,600
of people down from a UK based kind of, I also wouldn't say bootcamp, maybe like incubator

279
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,080
maybe called Coders and Founders, where they also kind of do the same type of thing, but

280
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,960
with the goal of not necessarily.

281
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,960
So I think with the code space stuff, we're specifically trying to get people into tech

282
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:40,440
careers, whereas with Coders and Founders, and I think a similar equivalent in South

283
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,480
Africa would be WeThinkCode, for whom I've also done a bit of work, where they maybe

284
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,080
like they see the tech skills as a way for you to kind of create your own startup.

285
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,120
And so you're not specifically looking to get hired in the tech field, you're actually

286
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,560
learning tech skills with the goal of creating your own business.

287
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,160
Yeah, there's a lot of, there's a lot of super exciting stuff going on there.

288
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,000
And I honestly, I have to, I have to kind of exercise a bit of respect because like,

289
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,400
you know, I just like, I just find it so inspiring, so exciting that, like, if I don't, like,

290
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,480
I'm just going to get involved in everything and burn myself out.

291
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,200
And like, and you probably know, like, also, like the, just the kind of, like, when you

292
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,320
have to compare that to actual salaries of working in tech, you also kind of take a bit

293
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,640
of it, which to me isn't that big of a deal, but now that I have a daughter, it's maybe

294
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,440
not that easy, easy anymore for me to just say, no, it's all right, like I can live on

295
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
passion alone.

296
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Yeah, yeah, very true, very true.

297
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,960
Yeah, that does change the game, but yeah, there's a lot of people who make it work,

298
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,960
nonetheless.

299
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,080
I'm exactly in the same boat, I mean, the reason I started the Mycelium Network is not

300
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:06,440
necessarily to benefit me directly, it's literally I want to share my knowledge and connect people

301
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,520
who want to get into code for whatever reason they have with people who can help them.

302
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:18,320
Because again, I was also privileged, of course, in my opportunities, but some of the things

303
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,040
I did, I made kind of a bold move, I mean, before I started when I started contracting

304
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:32,120
at Mozilla, I had a full-time paying job working for a contracting agency, and I was placed

305
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,520
at Vodacom, and I was earning a decent salary and getting medical aid and all that stuff.

306
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,440
But I wasn't happy doing the work, the work to me was meaningless, so that it was literally,

307
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,280
I couldn't care less about what I was building.

308
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:51,360
And I always had this thing with Mozilla and their manifesto and stuff like that, and being

309
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,760
built in open source, those things connected very well for me.

310
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,640
And at some point I decided, you know what, if I don't kind of just take the plunge, I'm

311
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,800
probably never going to do it.

312
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,760
And I actually resigned before actually having the job at Mozilla, and I had a family at

313
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
that point.

314
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:16,960
So it was scary, it worked out, so looking back at how I'm like, wow, I took a massive

315
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,000
chance there, but it all worked out in the end.

316
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But I want to create those opportunities for other people to also take a leap sometimes,

317
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,560
a leap of faith, and not be scared to fail.

318
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,800
Because in the world we live in today, there's so many mantras about failing, but then when

319
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,240
it comes to social media, you dare not show your failures until you are very successful,

320
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,320
and then you can speak about your failures.

321
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,400
But while you're still climbing the ladder and some of the rungs break under you, don't

322
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,320
tell anybody about that, keep it quiet.

323
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,560
And I think that should be normalized.

324
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,120
Doesn't matter where you are in your career or your path or whatever you want to call

325
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,080
it, it's always okay to fail, and it's always okay to get up and try again.

326
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,080
It's also okay to try a thing and find it's not for you and move on to something else.

327
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,720
The tech industry isn't for everybody.

328
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,480
It's also been sold to people in different ways, and sometimes falsities are being sold

329
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
to people.

330
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,240
There's almost Utopia is sold, which isn't always the case.

331
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,760
Even sometimes if you do stuff that you're passionate about, sometimes there's just stuff

332
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:43,200
that's just work, and you just kind of have to grind your teeth and just get through it.

333
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,040
No, a hundred percent.

334
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:53,440
I have the same thing with the front-end development South Africa stuff at the moment, where effectively

335
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:02,080
it's a nonprofit that I and a very good friend of mine, Justin Slack, kind of founded specifically

336
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,680
for kind of just advocating for front-end development and creating resources and connecting

337
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,600
practitioners in South Africa within the world of front-end development.

338
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,920
I almost want to say it's kind of been too successful in so far that now we need to do

339
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:26,360
a lot of stuff that actual real nonprofits need to do, like auditing and actually doing

340
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,000
operations, keeping track of where money is going, actually getting funding, bringing

341
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,520
contractors on board and so forth.

342
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,320
I always kind of miss the days when it was just me and him kind of just like cowboying

343
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,680
it, and that's exactly the same.

344
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:48,120
Obviously the part that I doing the finances is definitely I'm doing the taxes and whatever

345
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,000
and auditing is obviously the part I enjoy the least, but at the end of the day in terms

346
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,120
of just value, that is I guess where I can provide the most value.

347
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,600
I think there's also a part of I think sometimes a lot of specifically in the open source world,

348
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,400
I think a lot of it is sometimes romanticized a bit.

349
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:20,360
And yeah, like let me just put it this way, so you spoke about Zetatech and I might regret

350
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,080
mentioning this, but I guess it's so thematically relevant at the moment.

351
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:36,600
So last week, maybe two weeks ago, some of the admins on there actually got a personally

352
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:43,920
addressed letter from someone's lawyers threatening civil litigation because we banned them from

353
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Zetatech.

354
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Wow.

355
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Yeah.

356
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:55,000
So I think that is kind of the type of stuff you sometimes need to deal with, especially

357
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,400
like within the world of open source as well, with CodeBridge as well, a lot of the time

358
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:08,560
it's just actually managing humans and personalities that don't get along and whatever.

359
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,240
I think there's an inherent messiness to being involved in these type of things.

360
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:23,120
I think the fact that I can't even really say what CodeBridge actually was definitively

361
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,840
there's a messiness to that.

362
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,960
And I think specifically us in the tech world who are so used to clean code and debugging

363
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:39,920
things and efficiency, sometimes that messiness is quite hard for us to stomach because we

364
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,880
want to understand, we want to know what it is, we want answers.

365
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,040
And sometimes that messiness gives us kind of the same feeling that, for example, something

366
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,960
like spaghetti code might give us.

367
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,000
But in real life, you kind of need that messiness.

368
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,160
You can't have everything just clean and perfectly laid out.

369
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,520
That is very true.

370
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,640
I was just having a look here.

371
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,640
I'm reading this book about program management of open source projects.

372
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,440
And there's this quote that I think is kind of relevant to what you just said.

373
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,240
They say as a program manager, you coordinate the efforts of the contributor community to

374
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,200
meet the project's goals.

375
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,480
The title Chief Cat Herding Officer is a joke, but an apt one.

376
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,500
You're working with a group of largely of entirely composed volunteers to produce software

377
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,840
that other people will want to use.

378
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,600
Individually, contributors have their own interests and goals.

379
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,520
When you're a successful program manager, you get these individuals aligned in the same

380
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,560
general direction to meet overall goals of the community.

381
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,000
That was so well put to me.

382
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,120
I'm reading a really great book at the moment.

383
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,280
It's been recommended to me quite a bit, and I finally got down to reading it.

384
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,000
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

385
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's called The Goal.

386
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,120
No, I haven't read it.

387
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,440
So it's kind of very widely shared within the agile community.

388
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:21,320
It's actually a novel, but it's a novel about a factory manager and the factory on the verge

389
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,960
of getting shut down and then them trying to figure out how to save the factory and

390
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,040
so forth.

391
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:34,300
As part of that, they kind of like, yeah, obviously, I don't want to obviously lay out

392
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:41,360
the entire plot of the book, but as part of that, they come to some insights around just

393
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:49,680
the nature of projects and things like dependencies and estimations and so forth.

394
00:31:49,680 --> 00:32:00,040
But I think the fact that having it packaged as a novel to me is such a great way of communicating

395
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:06,720
that because obviously, there's a lot of great books on these type of things, like Lean Startup

396
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,760
and all of those books.

397
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,560
But I think now for me, as I'm reading this book and looking at it through the lens of

398
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,440
a novel of someone who's...

399
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,320
It's also like kind of his marriage is falling apart and whatever.

400
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:31,320
So kind of seeing the processes and all these things around how do you actually develop

401
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,520
in your career?

402
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,640
How do you actually manage a team?

403
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,600
How do you do all these things?

404
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,160
I think sometimes we forget all of that happens as a microcosm in this larger thing that is

405
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,040
just our lives in general and everyone else's lives.

406
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:55,520
So in that, you're dealing with personal things and you're having issues with family and you're

407
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,320
getting burnt out.

408
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,600
For me, I'm very open about my own struggles.

409
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,280
I have a pretty long history with mental illness as well.

410
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:11,720
So I'm pretty open and I wish I could talk about that more.

411
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:17,920
But sometimes when I try to kind of always be open about it, but sometimes I feel that

412
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:26,120
sometimes people feel sometimes it's a bit shoehorned into conversations.

413
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:34,160
And I think I was maybe overcorrecting a bit in terms of people not talking about it.

414
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,720
But that's tough for me, but that's almost like an entire podcast episode on itself.

415
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:49,200
I have a blog on Medium where I openly write about my struggles with substance abuse because

416
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,280
of mental health problems, anxiety, stuff like this.

417
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,520
So I very much understand all of this.

418
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:04,840
And the thing that I realized at some point is why do I want to compartmentalize my life

419
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,320
into these buckets?

420
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:14,520
Why do I feel the need to have that writing as open and honest as it is, be separate from

421
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,400
that stuff I write about tech?

422
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,240
It's almost as if I'm saying that it should be normalized and people shouldn't be afraid

423
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,520
to talk about these things.

424
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:34,080
But then I compartmentalize and I kind of, don't look there, that's personal.

425
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:46,160
And so it's super uncomfortable, but I am making a concerted effort to not do that.

426
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,640
Maybe I will have the blog separate on Medium because the audience that will benefit from

427
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:57,120
that is there, so it makes sense, but I won't hide from linking to it or talking about it

428
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,040
or mentioning it in a thing, which previously I would probably avoid.

429
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,520
Like I, for example, would have like a coffee thing and then I would have one that's like

430
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,800
for my personal and then one for my, oh, this is my professional.

431
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,780
And I realized that the reason I'm doing that is because of this whole thing that social

432
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,120
media is driving you towards.

433
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:23,060
It's saying no, when you're in the public eye, like whatever that is, five people looking

434
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:28,720
at you or 5,000, doesn't matter, your human nature kicks in in the same way.

435
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,760
You have to put your best foot forward.

436
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,280
And admitting that you have struggles is not that.

437
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,320
It's like I just said about the failure thing.

438
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,080
You can talk about failure once you've succeeded, but once you haven't succeeded, I'm putting

439
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,480
it in quotes, you're not allowed to talk about your failures because then you just look weak.

440
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
And that's nonsense.

441
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,840
I mean, show me a person whose life has gone just peach perfect, like from day one up to

442
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
the day they are now.

443
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
We all have struggles.

444
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,180
And I think the more we talk about that, the better.

445
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,640
And I think people will be more okay with also understanding.

446
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,280
I found that personally, if you're open about these things, people are more willing to like,

447
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,680
you know, come meet you in the middle, so to speak.

448
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,120
They're more understanding if you're open about it.

449
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,600
And of course, you're going to find people who are not like that.

450
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:27,040
But I think for the most part, you're going to be surprised by people's reaction when

451
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
you're actually honest.

452
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,920
Yeah, and I think about that quite a lot.

453
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:39,800
And sometimes I wonder whether I'd be as open about these things if once again, you know,

454
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:47,720
like I guess, so I explicitly on my LinkedIn profile, you know, so I think I have a front

455
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:55,080
end development, product design, teaching, and destigmatizing mental illness.

456
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:02,040
And I sometimes wonder if I would be this open about it if, you know, if, you know,

457
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:11,080
I wasn't, what would be the word, if the tech industry wasn't so, didn't have as many opportunities.

458
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Like I'm struggling to kind of figure out how to phrase it now.

459
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,280
I know what you're trying to say though, yeah.

460
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
Yeah.

461
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,880
So if it was a bit more of a competitive like kind of industry, and you know, there was

462
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,760
a shortage of work or whatever, specifically within the tech world, like anyone, like if

463
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,120
you are slightly above intermediate level, you are very in demand.

464
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:40,760
So I think sometimes I wonder whether I would have like been as open about it if I knew

465
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,600
that, you know, I was struggling to get work and, you know, like there was very few positions

466
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,320
out there and anything that can be used against you, like would be used against you.

467
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Yeah.

468
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Yeah.

469
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,520
But like, I don't know, like maybe let's see in 10 years, things might change.

470
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,200
I might be like, that was a really big mistake.

471
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,960
Like I shouldn't have been as public about it.

472
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,400
But I think for now, like I've been, I've been managing somewhat well, I've been managing

473
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,480
very well while at the same time being open about kind of like all my personal struggles

474
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
and so forth.

475
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Yeah.

476
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,840
And I actually did a very interesting like talk.

477
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:26,880
So I was asked by some of the, so some of the folks at Deriel.

478
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
So they sometimes have speakers come and chat to the team.

479
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,040
And I, so I think they, at some point we're looking for someone to chat about mental health.

480
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,600
And I've been promising myself that I would do an actual real talk on it at some point,

481
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,920
and not just like mention it as an aside.

482
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,080
So I kind of just volunteer to do it.

483
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:54,140
And I think specifically, like I actually spent a lot of time talking and reflecting

484
00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:04,200
on how much I've actually learned about kind of being human just from like getting deeper

485
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,640
into the world of product design.

486
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,320
And I think I really resonate with what you're saying about, you know, failure and so forth.

487
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,240
But I think it's even more, it's actually not necessarily even failure, but I think

488
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:26,200
it's being able to understand things and like being able to articulate that failure.

489
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,000
I think when you're in the, like, and I think within the world of product design as well,

490
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,560
you know, there's often a saying that it's not necessarily that you're scared that someone

491
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,640
isn't going to be receptive to your idea.

492
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,760
You're scared that you're not going to do your idea justice if you share it too early.

493
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,600
So if you push that MVP out too early, maybe you're like, okay, cool, we should have actually

494
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,320
just done this and it wouldn't have failed.

495
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,960
So like it's more a thing about like missed opportunity or not being able to express the

496
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,520
actual value of something early on.

497
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,880
And I find it to be the same as well with kind of discussions around failure and just

498
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
general experience and so forth.

499
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,960
And I think it ties into what you said that, you know, if you can reflect back and you

500
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,640
can very nicely articulate and make sense of what was going on, you know, and frame

501
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,920
it in terms of a bigger journey, that's a lot easier to do than when you're in the thick

502
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,920
of it and it's confusing and it's messy and you don't know what's going on.

503
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,080
You don't even know if it's a failure, but you're just, you don't, it's this blob and

504
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,280
you don't know how to make sense of it.

505
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:44,040
I think that's when it's hard and being vulnerable at that moment, I think is very hard.

506
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,440
But I think like I've kind of learned a lot from the world of product design specifically

507
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,640
in that regards, because there's a lot of similarities there in terms of actually pushing

508
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,200
a product out and not actually even really knowing what it is or what value it provides

509
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,300
and wanting to hold back all the time and be like, okay, let's just refine it a little

510
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
bit more.

511
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,160
It needs a bit more polish.

512
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,360
And like, I think even if you think about things like extreme programming and so forth,

513
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,120
you know, so one of the core principles of extreme programming is which, you know, Agile

514
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,040
kind of grew out of the world of extreme programming and so forth is courage.

515
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:31,640
So and yeah, so I think there's a lot within this field and I think it's almost like the

516
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,560
tech field is almost, I think, pushing humans to like, I guess, the edge of what they're

517
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,480
comfortable dealing with complexity wise.

518
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,000
And because of that, it's actually bringing up a lot of stuff in you in terms of uncertainty

519
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,240
and, you know, like people talk a lot about imposter syndrome.

520
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,080
Yes, and but like, specifically, it's a big thing in the tech industry.

521
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,480
But like, I think sometimes we don't ask like, why is it so big in the tech world?

522
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,840
Why isn't many people talk about imposter syndrome amongst plumbers or farmers or, you

523
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,000
know, nurses?

524
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,440
And I think it's just because, like, what we are required to do in the world of tech

525
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:27,520
is so kind of straining in terms of emotionally for us and like, our capabilities and yeah,

526
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,440
like I often joke and I say that, you know, as you get more senior kind of the imposter

527
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,520
syndrome kind of starts going away, but and it's not because you get better, but you just

528
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,600
realize like how like bad everything else is out there, that you kind of realize, yeah,

529
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,280
you know, I didn't know much and whatever.

530
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,320
But no one else knows anything.

531
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
Exactly.

532
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Yeah.

533
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,880
So it's like, I mean, look at look at look at kind of that incident with WhatsApp and

534
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,800
Facebook with the DNS, like, like, I'll always remember the date, because it's the date my

535
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,960
daughter was born.

536
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,880
So and so, like everyone was like, so we couldn't send anyone any WhatsApp messages or anything

537
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,520
or any photos or whatever, because WhatsApp was down.

538
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,680
Yeah, what a day for WhatsApp to go down.

539
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,080
Yeah, exactly.

540
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
Yeah, exactly.

541
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:26,800
So but like, I think like that just kind of shows you as well, you know, like it's like,

542
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,040
I think like, at some point, you just realize just like how, like, with prayers and sticky

543
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:42,200
tape, and, you know, just how, how kind of just held together ad hoc most of these things

544
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,920
are and how people are just kind of just getting by in terms of what they actually understand

545
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,160
and what they can actually do.

546
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,240
And how the complexity of the things we're building far out seed actually our abilities

547
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,360
to manage it.

548
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,960
And I think that kind of that kind of makes the some of the imposter syndrome kind of

549
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,960
fizzle away.

550
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,600
You just realize everyone else really sucks at this as well.

551
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
Yeah.

552
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
Yeah.

553
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,080
No, that's very true.

554
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:17,400
And I think people also oftentimes underestimate how understanding your users can be.

555
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,280
You know, if something doesn't quite work, they'll find a way around it or they'll they'll

556
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,280
try again.

557
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,320
There's very few instances with your everyday like website or application where somebody

558
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,760
is going to make a huge fuss about the fact that the button didn't quite react in the

559
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
way it was.

560
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,240
Or when I resize my browser window, there was this moment where two things were misaligned.

561
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,680
Like we sweat all that small stuff, but in the real world, honestly, like, first of all,

562
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,920
you run into it all the time because it's humans making these things and we're all fallible.

563
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,440
And the second point, that is not the end of the world.

564
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,480
It's like make your window a little bigger and then it's aligned again if it bothers

565
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
you.

566
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
Yeah.

567
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
It's okay.

568
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
No, a hundred percent.

569
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,400
I, both you and I will probably get a lot of hate mail for actually saying this.

570
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,480
But I, I wish it wasn't the case.

571
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,960
Honestly, I wish it wasn't the case.

572
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:20,440
I wish like, like people would be more outraged at bad experiences on the web.

573
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:26,640
Cause I think like then if it hurts companies, they would actually put more resources into

574
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,160
it.

575
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,280
And I always tell my students as well, you know, like specifically my design students

576
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,400
that I wish it wasn't the case.

577
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:41,480
I wish I could tell you that, you know, you need to treat your users with respect.

578
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,560
You know, like it's a very brittle relationship.

579
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,360
If you break their trust, you know, like that's very important.

580
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,800
Like, and I believe all those things.

581
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,920
I wish I could say like that translates also into actually successful business.

582
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,920
But like what I've unfortunately learned over the years is that like, yeah, like I've, I've

583
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:09,080
just been part of like projects and stuff where things were just like broken and, um,

584
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:15,160
you know, and somehow like, so people complained on Twitter and they kind of wrote a lot of

585
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,560
angry stuff.

586
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,400
And a year later, like things were just back to the way they were.

587
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,840
Once those issues were resolved, um, you know, like how many times has Woolworths been boycotted

588
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,840
now?

589
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:32,080
Like how many of those people that boycotted with some company like Woolworths over the

590
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,160
years are now back at Woolworths again.

591
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,440
I wish it wasn't the case, but, um, but at the very least, if anything, it also like

592
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:48,560
kind of just like eases a bit of the pressure of having to have everything be perfect.

593
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:57,040
Um, like I think sometimes in terms of companies, it may be like makes for some gross incentives,

594
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,640
but I think as individuals working in this space, um, it's also not the end of the world

595
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,640
if things break.

596
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Yeah.

597
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,640
Yeah, no, for sure.

598
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,240
And I mean, I'm not advocating for doing sloppy work.

599
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:16,200
It's more a case of, um, doing something right takes time.

600
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,840
And, um, when business interests clash with time, oftentimes, you know, you literally

601
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,700
just don't have the time to do it the way you would like to do it.

602
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,160
And so sometimes you need to make trade-offs.

603
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,300
Um, and that is where I'm talking about, like where the forgiving nature of people will

604
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,960
come in and like, kind of save you from, from those situations.

605
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:45,360
Cause I mean, if, if we all had product managers or product owners who weren't driven by OKRs

606
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,520
and deadlines and stuff like that, we would build software that is much more resilient.

607
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:57,160
And, um, you know, it's done better, but sometimes time constraints forces you to, to take shortcuts

608
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,160
unfortunately.

609
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,160
Yeah.

610
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:05,120
And to me, honestly, I, this is such a hard thing for me and, you know, I'm, I'm kind

611
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,160
of even scared to talk about it because, uh, like I know how a lot of people are going

612
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,440
to react, but, you know, uh, I can just honestly speak about kind of how things look from where

613
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm standing.

614
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And I think like I'm someone who's very passionate about accessibility.

615
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,520
I've, I've done several talks on accessibility.

616
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:29,360
We actually at Frontend Development every year on Global Accessibility Awareness Day,

617
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,440
we do a specific event.

618
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:38,320
This year we had a phenomenal one, uh, where, um, Brett, um, someone I met at DevConf who's

619
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,680
a, who's a blind front end developer actually did a talk and actually showed how he codes

620
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,400
as a blind developer.

621
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:55,720
Um, so, but yeah, like I, a lot of, like I'm struggling to find some type of incentive

622
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:02,640
for companies to really care about accessibility apart from just making them feel bad for not

623
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,640
doing it.

624
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,680
Uh, I think a lot of people would argue that there are, you know, like financial, you can

625
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,080
frame it financially and, and whatever.

626
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:17,680
And honestly, I think a lot of like business thinking around like business and so forth,

627
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,320
you know, the whole 80-20 rule, you know, 20% of your users account for like 80% of

628
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,320
your kind of value.

629
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:29,440
Um, you know, like that flies in the face of catering to a smaller percentage, um, that

630
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,980
had like that really require more accessibility.

631
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:39,920
And I think there's also like, we sometimes get a bit stuck on, um, yeah, I'm just so

632
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,360
scared that I'm just going to say something that I'm going to regret, not necessarily

633
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:49,440
that I'm withholding anything, but accessibility is such a, such a touchy subject and I'm scared

634
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,440
I'm going to say something that can be misconstrued or come across like in a way that I don't

635
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,440
intend that.

636
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,320
But yeah, it is, it is, it is tough, man.

637
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:06,160
Like I, you know, like I often find anytime I'm involved in a project where we actually

638
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,320
care about accessibility, it's just because I'm forcing it, it's because I'm in a position

639
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,960
of power and I'm saying that, you know, we're going to do this as a team.

640
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,640
You don't have a choice, otherwise I'm not going to manage this project.

641
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:28,440
Um, yeah, it's, it's, it's tough and yeah, like that's, that's also, that's a podcast

642
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,440
on its own.

643
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,440
No, for sure.

644
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,080
No, and I mean, it, it, it boils down to the fact that you have to get people to truly

645
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,440
care.

646
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,840
Um, and that is, I don't, it's better, let me, let me be totally honest.

647
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:47,800
Like, I mean, uh, the tooling around it has improved leaps and bounds and the number of

648
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:54,080
people that talk about it as growing exponentially, which I love.

649
00:50:54,080 --> 00:51:02,520
But in the end of the day, what's the important thing is, is that people who are not evangelists

650
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,200
care about this.

651
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,000
Like you understand, and I think one of the new ways that it's being framed that I like

652
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,880
is this whole idea of oftentimes when you do something to benefit somebody with, um,

653
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,680
some ability challenges, benefits all your users in the end of the day.

654
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,440
And I think the more we can pull examples out of the real world to demonstrate that,

655
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,320
the more it becomes less of a, I'm doing it for a small percentage of my audience to a,

656
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,480
I'm doing a thing that's going to benefit a small percentage of our audience.

657
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,320
But a turns out it's also going to benefit all the other people as well.

658
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:42,800
Um, and I think there's more and more of those examples being, uh, highlighted and that,

659
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,240
that changes the conversation because I know for the longest time, the way to talk about

660
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,560
it was, well, you know, you can get sued.

661
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,240
Have you heard about Target?

662
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,840
And I don't know if fear-mongering is the way to get people to care about something.

663
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:00,320
I would, I would say, like, I would like, you know, I'd actually say I hold the opposite

664
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
position.

665
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:07,040
Like for me, the only, to me, the only, the only real way we're going to get any sort

666
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:14,080
of traction on this is if there is like financial realities of punishment, uh, for companies.

667
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,560
Because you know, like, like, yeah, I do, I do hear what you're saying.

668
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:24,400
Um, but like, if I just like look at like how, what a tight ship a lot of companies

669
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,360
are running, you know, um, even just sometimes making it a good experience for the average

670
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:35,720
user, you know, like the, the completely able-bodied user, like sometimes there's not even enough

671
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,880
like time to actually do that because other features need to be shipped.

672
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,320
And I also have to say, you know, like we can head on companies as much as we want,

673
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,320
but there is a big shortage of developers.

674
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:55,200
So that usually means that any team won't ever be able to get to all the work that needs

675
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,580
to be done.

676
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:02,080
So like most teams have positions that have just been open for years and they haven't

677
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,320
folded and they're just short staffed.

678
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:11,200
Um, so I do think there is a bit of a kind of like, you know, like companies just like,

679
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,320
like having bad incentives, but I also think a lot of it is just like skills, you know,

680
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:22,840
like, uh, yeah, like, and I think, you know, just in terms of like, and I think specific

681
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:29,360
in South Africa, I have a theory where, um, in South Africa specifically, I think, I think

682
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:35,400
we're trying to, to, to combat a lot of that with FATSA is that, and I'm as guilty of this

683
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,400
as well.

684
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,840
I do a lot of international work, um, because, you know, South African companies can't really

685
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,760
compete with the exchange rate, you know, I get paid in pounds and dollars, like, you

686
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,960
know, South African tech company can't really compete.

687
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:56,400
Um, and so that by nature means once people reach a certain level of seniority, they immediately

688
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,960
start working with like, you know, international teams, um, which is great, but at the end

689
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:09,640
of the day, what then happens is like the actual, like the actual skills in the actual

690
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:16,640
pool of people that are working on South African products, um, is, you know, greatly diminished.

691
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,000
Um, and you, you don't have those opportunities for mentorship in South African teams and

692
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,440
so forth, which I'm of the opinion that the South African, you know, like just experience

693
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,320
of using South African products on the web and so forth is, is not at the standard that

694
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,320
it should be.

695
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,320
Like, I think we are South Africans just assume because, you know, it's take a lot or because

696
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,560
it's show max or whatever, we can't hold show max to the same standards as Netflix.

697
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,600
We can't have all take a lot to the same standard as Amazon or whatever, you know?

698
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:54,520
Um, and like, I, I do think unfortunately it's, it's like, it's a bit self perpetuating

699
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:00,960
and um, yeah, I would wish if, if, if South Africans were more demanding of kind of the,

700
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:06,040
the, the experience that they get from actual tech products in South Africa.

701
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,040
Yeah.

702
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,720
Um, do you think, um, this is a general thing in developing countries where, um, essentially

703
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:19,840
when you reach, when developers reach this level of seniority, you have this, like they

704
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,480
say brain drain.

705
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,760
And so automatically kind of have this knock on effect happening.

706
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,480
And then, yeah, some people are going to get left behind in that, that story, right?

707
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,960
They're never going to, they're never going to reach that seniority because the people

708
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,160
that can help them get their leave.

709
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Yeah.

710
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,160
And, and, you know, and it's interesting.

711
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:45,280
So, um, like I've actually, actually, actually spoken to Phillip from Office Zen, uh, one

712
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,760
of the co-founders of Office Zen about this quite a lot, because what they're seeing is

713
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:54,880
they're seeing a lot of, and not only South Africans actually, you know, working for European

714
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,840
companies and so forth post COVID, you know, like, like as the whole world went more remote.

715
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:04,560
Um, they're also seeing a lot of actual developers from other countries come and work in South

716
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,120
Africa, just because it's a, it's a nice climate.

717
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:11,160
The cost of living is, you know, like pretty inexpensive and so forth.

718
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,320
And they work with their kind of teams in Silicon Valley or whatever, but they're based

719
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,040
in Cape Town.

720
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,680
And so, like, I think what I, where I stand on that, and when I, some, what I've made

721
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,120
into Phillip as well is that I think there's a danger there in not seeing that as a brain

722
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,760
drain just because people are still physically here.

723
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,560
And what happens is, you know, once again, the actual teams in South Africa, the juniors

724
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:46,120
in South Africa and, you know, those like working adjacent to developers, uh, you know,

725
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:52,200
maybe in product design or in tech support or whatever, like they are getting deprived

726
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:57,320
of a lot of like seniority and opportunities for mentoring and, you know, and so forth.

727
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,320
Yeah.

728
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,440
Um, it's tricky.

729
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,440
It's tricky.

730
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,360
I don't know, but once again, I'm as guilty of this as anyone else.

731
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:10,760
Um, I have to also say that, you know, unfortunately also, I find that, you know, South African

732
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,600
tech companies don't treat the employees that well, unfortunately.

733
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,440
And that's been my experience as well.

734
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,280
I think specifically as a front end developer, I often feel that South African companies

735
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,240
tend to see front end development as an afterthought.

736
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,200
So like, yeah, it's not a real job.

737
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:35,440
Yeah, and it's like, you get the designs from the designer and you get the API or not, not

738
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,160
even the API, let's say you're doing PHP templating or whatever, you know, you just write the,

739
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,680
make the CSS fit the design.

740
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,720
Like there's no mention of like design systems or any of that stuff, you know?

741
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:53,720
Um, so like, so now like you're given, you're given the opportunity to, um, be less respected

742
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,760
and earn less money just out of principle, you know?

743
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,640
So I think at some, at some point, yeah.

744
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,360
So at some point, like even I'm like, you know, so I try and, so there's a company called

745
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:13,880
Palmetrix that I, um, do like a big, about 50% of my work, um, is for them.

746
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:20,600
Um, so they're kind of like a seller dashboard for, um, sellers, third party sellers on take

747
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
a lot.

748
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Um, yeah.

749
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,720
Um, so, um, yeah, so that is the big, one of the big South African teams that I work

750
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,720
with.

751
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:35,000
And it's just because also I share a lot of the, um, like there's a lot of overlap in

752
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,400
terms of just like culture and whatever.

753
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,120
So I really enjoy working with the team there.

754
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:44,900
Um, but like most of my other works international, unfortunately.

755
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:50,320
So as a teacher, cause I know that's a large part of, of what you do, what do you see the

756
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,320
role of open source?

757
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,480
How does, what role does it play in learning and in teaching?

758
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,480
Hmm.

759
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,480
Sure.

760
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
Um, yes.

761
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,480
Okay.

762
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:05,080
That, that should, that's a tough one.

763
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:11,960
Um, I can say for one that it isn't playing nearly as big as a role as it should.

764
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:24,360
Um, I, I still see so many teams that are effectively trying to create their own worst

765
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,480
version of MDN.

766
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,800
I've just encountered so many, like, cause I've seen, I've taught that a lot of places

767
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,960
I've kind of been involved in a lot of programs and so forth and there's an obsession with

768
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:52,400
creating content and I think in terms of education, we are still like, we're kind of in almost

769
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,800
like we're kind of like, so there's a really great book, um, by the name of info.

770
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,800
We trust.

771
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:04,760
Um, and it talks about, you know, like we, like the information age isn't like on the

772
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,640
horizon anymore.

773
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,480
We're like, we're like in the shoulder, shoulder depth in it.

774
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:18,120
We're like drowning in information and you know, like, like, and I think indicative of

775
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:23,720
that is just like the fact that, you know, most of the big tech companies and then the

776
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:30,960
most profitable to companies is companies that actually help navigate that just sea

777
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:38,880
of information, whether it be Google or Facebook or Twitter or whatever, or even Wikipedia.

778
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,720
So but I do think a lot of educational programs and a lot of people involved in those programs

779
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:53,280
are still in a mind, like, like in a, in a, in a information scarcity mindset where they

780
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,720
think the value that they're providing is giving students content, give like creating

781
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,920
reading material, creating instructional videos and things for you for, for, and I think one

782
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:12,080
thing that we've started exploring at code space is, um, I'm obviously going to speak

783
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,800
a lot about code space because, because that is like where I spend most of my teaching

784
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,600
time at the moment.

785
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,680
We've started exploring, not creating any new content.

786
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,920
So playing the role of curating content.

787
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:34,000
So sending people to MDN, giving them a list of YouTube videos to watch and so forth.

788
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,760
And thinking about the value we provide a bit differently.

789
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,320
Um, I think I draw a lot of inspiration from, um, the Odin project.

790
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,320
You're probably familiar with Odin project.

791
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,320
Yes.

792
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,320
Yeah.

793
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:53,800
So they also tend to take a more of a curation role than an actual creating content role.

794
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,800
Yeah.

795
01:01:54,800 --> 01:02:00,000
Yeah, like does the world really need one more YouTube video on Flexbox?

796
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,160
Um, probably not and probably not with the budget that I have, you know, like I'll just

797
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:12,820
leave it to actual like high producing streamers to do like a really engaging video on how

798
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,280
Flexbox works.

799
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,560
So what is the value that I provide then?

800
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:23,800
And I always start, I always start by asking my students, why are you here instead of just

801
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,440
doing a 200 rand Udemy course?

802
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,440
Um, and like they never even actually think about that, but even worse, like why are you

803
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:39,040
here when you could just be doing free code camp, um, which most of the time has even

804
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,040
better outcomes than a lot of these boot camps.

805
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:48,680
So I think what we've been trying to do is integrate a lot more of those things.

806
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:57,780
So instead, like actually having students do free code camp in addition to what we provide.

807
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,960
So instead of seeing something like free code camp or Udemy or whatever, as a competitor

808
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:09,960
to the training that we provide, seeing how we can maybe play a more curation role in

809
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,440
terms of guiding people in terms of, okay, if I want to go into this, what are things

810
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,640
worth exploring?

811
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,720
If I want to build this type of app, what are the stuff I should be looking at?

812
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,960
What are the, cause there's also a lot of like misinformation out there.

813
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:31,760
Um, like what are the things, you know, should I be using MDN or should I be using W3 schools?

814
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:39,560
You know, um, most I've, I'm sure I've seen so many programs where they actually use W3

815
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,160
schools as actual reference.

816
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,160
I'm like, yeah.

817
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:48,480
Okay, I shouldn't probably have said that part out loud, but yeah, like it's pretty

818
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,920
well known that I'm not a big fan of W3 schools.

819
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:58,560
Um, but yeah, like, so I think to answer your question, what role should open source be

820
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,560
playing?

821
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,560
Sure.

822
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,280
I don't know a role at this point.

823
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,880
I don't, I don't think it's playing that much of a role at the moment.

824
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:13,120
Um, we, we just have too many people creating content, too many people building LMSs.

825
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:19,680
Um, when something like GitHub actually has a really solid, like educational platform

826
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,520
that you can use, yeah.

827
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,040
And you can set it up so it runs automated tests and whatever.

828
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:33,600
Do we really need to be building another Laravel powered like LMS for our specific bootcamp

829
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,880
or our specific?

830
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,880
Yeah.

831
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:44,360
I think like there's a bit of a mindset change that needs to happen there in terms of relying

832
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:49,040
more on open source things, relying more on what's out there.

833
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:56,440
And I think there's a bit of fear there in so far that people are scared that that's

834
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,440
going to make them redundant.

835
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:05,560
Um, yeah, but I, but I, but I also think, you know, I don't know, there's maybe easy

836
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:12,560
for me to say, but if it makes you redundant, then so be it, you know, um, like would you

837
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:22,240
rather, would you rather try and stay relevant at the expense of students at the expense

838
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:28,160
of their, so I told my wife yesterday, sorry, like I just have so many things I can say

839
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,160
on this topic.

840
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,500
I told my wife yesterday.

841
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:37,640
So like at code space, we for next year, we have an intake of 150 students.

842
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,000
And like, shoo, like that's the biggest intake we've had ever.

843
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,080
And yeah, like, and it's, it's so scary.

844
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,080
It's shoo.

845
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:54,680
It's like, you literally have the ability to mess up 150 people's possible career prospects.

846
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,680
Yeah.

847
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,680
That is scary.

848
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,920
So like, but yeah, like that, that's a conversation for another day.

849
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:14,120
Um, but yeah, it's, it's, I just find that, I just find that there's a lot of misidentification

850
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:18,720
of the real value that education provides in the information age.

851
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:26,000
Um, I think a lot of, especially a lot of like boot camps and stuff, try and copy what

852
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,640
universities are doing.

853
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:34,920
Because I think it, they're under the impression they, it's more legit.

854
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:41,520
Universities are quote unquote better than just like some random, but I don't know.

855
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:46,840
Like as someone who's done a lot of work for universities, like, shoo, like, like the,

856
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,200
the university model is not what you want to be copying and saying this as someone who

857
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,520
has a, has a master's degree himself and spent seven years studying, um, like I honestly

858
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:02,560
think like the university model is very flawed in this day and age.

859
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:08,680
Um, and I think we need to do some fundamental rethinking in terms of how we train people.

860
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:19,080
Um, a good friend of mine, um, Candice, um, she works for a company called fourth rev,

861
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:23,960
so fourth industrial revolution, uh, revolution.

862
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:33,200
And so they are exploring a lot of these things in terms of how do you do education in a world

863
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,560
like the one we're in today.

864
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:39,840
And honestly, I don't, I don't necessarily have any good suggestions.

865
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:45,600
I think I can maybe just say like, there's a lot of stuff we're doing really badly.

866
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:51,320
Um, and we should maybe just address them before we actually see how we can improve.

867
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:58,480
Um, just give a, give an average experience like, uh, before we even aim for great.

868
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,560
Um, yeah, I'd be here like, like I'd be curious, just, you know, like most people that I speak

869
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:11,480
to that have some type of training in coding or whatever, like is pretty dissatisfied with

870
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,520
kind of their bootcamp experience.

871
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,520
Yeah.

872
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:21,400
Um, and a lot of them, like this in spite of kind of like the course that they did or

873
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,720
the degree that they got or whatever, um, actually succeed.

874
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:32,560
Um, yeah, so I don't know, like it kind of feels like we don't necessarily have to win

875
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,560
at this game.

876
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:40,720
Like at this point, we just need to stop scoring like own goals at the very least at the very

877
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,920
least, just like stop sabotaging ourselves.

878
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,520
Let's just like at least stop the, stop the bad stuff and then we can focus on making

879
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,520
it better.

880
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,160
Yeah, no, I totally agree.

881
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,000
And I think that the duration thing you were talking about, I think that is the missing

882
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,520
link at the moment.

883
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,040
Everybody that I speak to that's, that's new and starting to learn, it's not like that

884
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,240
there isn't content out there.

885
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:09,040
There's actually too much, um, and so finding, finding a past through all of that is what

886
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,120
they find much, much more, um, challenging than finding content.

887
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,120
They don't know what to trust.

888
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:19,280
They don't know if this person is, is good or not.

889
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,920
There's different modalities, different ways people learn.

890
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:27,960
And so I think being at the curation space and doing a really good job at that is I think

891
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,880
much more important right now than just, like you said, creating another version of MDN

892
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,800
or free code camp or whatever the case may be.

893
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,800
Yeah.

894
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,740
But I mean, that's effectively what you're doing here.

895
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,680
So instead of doing like, welcome to the Sculpt Nietling stream.

896
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:45,120
And I'm going to be teaching you about what you need to know as a developer.

897
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,420
You're kind of relying on what people are doing out there and what's, what people already

898
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:54,800
explored and surfacing that, uh, instead of trying to create stuff.

899
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,800
Yeah.

900
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
Like, so at the very least you have that going for you.

901
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,800
That's good too.

902
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,800
Yeah.

903
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
That's good.

904
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Cause that was the intent.

905
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,800
From one Sculpt to another.

906
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,800
Yeah.

907
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,760
So this was really great.

908
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,480
I think this is a wonderful conversation that is like far reaching and it delved into all

909
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,120
kinds of things, which I think is really, really interesting and people are going to

910
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,680
enjoy listening to it.

911
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,320
And so in closing, um, Tim Ferriss has this thing at the end of his show that he always

912
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,840
asks people, if you, if you had a billboard and they're really, really busy street and

913
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,820
you could put a phrase on there for everybody to see, what would that be?

914
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:36,200
So my question is similar in nature, but then the message would be, what would that message

915
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,960
be for people that getting into tech?

916
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,960
Okay.

917
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:46,960
Like that would very much depend on what time of day you ask me, uh, or even like what day

918
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,800
of the week you ask me.

919
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:57,200
So I would probably just default to like whatever I tell my students the most.

920
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:04,120
And I think what I always come back to is that it doesn't need to suck this much.

921
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:10,520
Like I think a lot of them have an expectation that, you know, they're going to have to work

922
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,960
through the night.

923
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:16,640
They're going to have to like, uh, put in all these hours.

924
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,400
They're going to have to, like, people are going to have to treat them like crap.

925
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:26,720
Um, and like, honestly, I, like, I always tell my students, there are teams out there.

926
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,760
There are people out there that are like, I don't want any part of that.

927
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:35,560
Like if you come and work for us, if you're part of our team, we don't want that.

928
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,120
We're going to, we're going to like actively push you to take care of yourself.

929
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:46,360
And I find that, you know, with my students, a lot of times there's an expectation that

930
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:52,520
they need to almost like bow down to this hustle culture and they can't be like, I actually

931
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,400
want to take care of myself.

932
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,480
I actually want to be in a, in a healthy mental state.

933
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,520
I don't want to sacrifice my mental health and like, yeah.

934
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,560
And to me, it's just like, I always tell them like the tech field is just so wide and there's

935
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:15,720
just so many people doing so many different things that you don't need to settle for something

936
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,400
that you feel is not aligned with your values.

937
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:25,800
And I think that is one of the, one of the benefits that we have within the tech field

938
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,400
is just because at the moment there's such a big demand.

939
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,960
So you should be able to find something that resonates with you.

940
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,200
Don't just like, especially if you're a junior, a junior and you're looking for your first

941
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,240
job, don't just settle for the first thing that comes along.

942
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:50,240
You, like there is a lot of teams that treat people with respect that value you as a human.

943
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,160
And there's a lot of companies that are forced to do this just because they need developers

944
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:59,200
so badly, even if they would have treated you like garbage.

945
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:04,200
So I think that's what I always tell my students is that there's a lot more room out there

946
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:09,720
for you to have a better experience than you maybe think there is.

947
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,720
Yeah.

948
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,720
I think that's great advice.

949
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:13,720
Thanks a lot, Skol.

950
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:14,720
This was wonderful.

951
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:19,520
As I said, thank you for spending your Friday afternoon with me.

952
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,520
Yeah.

953
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,520
It was really great.

954
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,520
Yeah.

955
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:28,640
Now it's back to changing nappies and the bad stuff.

956
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,640
Back to the real world.

957
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,640
Yeah.

958
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,640
Yeah.

959
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,640
Cool.

960
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,640
Thanks so much.

961
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:34,640
This was really great.

962
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:35,640
Yeah.

963
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:36,640
I hope we can chat again soon.

964
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,640
Oh, for sure.

965
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,640
Cheers.

966
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,640
Cool.

967
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,640
Cheers, man.
