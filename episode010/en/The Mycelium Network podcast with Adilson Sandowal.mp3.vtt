Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.680 --> 00:09.840
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.320
Hey, Adelson.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.360
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.440
I'm so glad that you can join me.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.440
Thank you so much.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.440
Thank you for the invitation.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.600
It's totally my pleasure.

00:20.600 --> 00:25.600
So I know about you again, like many of the guests that I've spoken to before, through

00:25.600 --> 00:30.680
the contributions you've made to MDN, that I've been involved with the review process

00:30.680 --> 00:35.360
or making sure the right people look at your pull requests.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.560
But I think in those days, you were still kind of job hunting.

00:39.560 --> 00:44.280
But I know since then, you've landed a really good job that you're very happy at.

00:44.280 --> 00:49.800
So to get us started, can you give us a rundown of your background?

00:49.800 --> 00:55.200
And I want you to take your time here, go back as far as you'd like and bring us up

00:55.200 --> 00:56.960
to the current day.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.680
Yeah, sure.

00:58.680 --> 00:59.680
No problem.

00:59.680 --> 01:08.720
So I was a mathematics teacher for high school, almost nine years.

01:08.720 --> 01:14.960
And at the end of 2018, I decided to change career.

01:14.960 --> 01:21.160
And the reason of that was mainly because I wanted more flexibility about the place

01:21.160 --> 01:24.240
where I was able to work.

01:24.240 --> 01:29.080
I was really, really excited about that kind of project.

01:29.080 --> 01:34.040
I shared on the web about some jobs that could allow you that, and I really wanted it.

01:34.040 --> 01:39.880
Another one was about increasing my income, because unfortunately, the job that I had

01:39.880 --> 01:42.200
didn't pay that much.

01:42.200 --> 01:50.520
So before I finished or before I started the mathematics career, I was very good at programming

01:50.520 --> 01:52.400
and mathematics.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.600
And so I thought, okay, I shouldn't complicate myself that much.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.200
Let's go something related to programming.

01:59.200 --> 02:06.080
And at that time, the language that I was using the most was Python, mostly for scripts

02:06.080 --> 02:09.320
about processing data and that kind of stuff.

02:09.320 --> 02:13.560
So I didn't know anything about web development.

02:13.560 --> 02:19.180
I wanted to, but I didn't spend the time to learn about that.

02:19.180 --> 02:24.160
So I decided, okay, let's quit the job that I had and let's dedicate myself one year.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.200
At that time, I said to myself, like, one year.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.040
I think one year is going to be enough.

02:28.040 --> 02:31.120
And now I was wrong about that.

02:31.120 --> 02:38.000
So I started and check about what was the requirement.

02:38.000 --> 02:46.000
Check first about the options that we have about programming, how was the demand for

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
jobs.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.440
I realized that web development was the one that had more opportunities.

02:51.440 --> 02:57.320
Also didn't mention, but one of the requirements was about not, because I took into consideration

02:57.320 --> 03:03.120
the time that was going to take me, about not requiring academic certification.

03:03.120 --> 03:07.920
And web development was like, okay, we only need you to have the skills.

03:07.920 --> 03:15.520
So yeah, I gathered like a kind of a small path, create a small path, like I need to

03:15.520 --> 03:23.000
learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, JavaScript, mostly programming.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.440
I had already advantage of knowing programming, so that didn't take me that long.

03:28.440 --> 03:34.640
And the other two, well, there was plenty to learn for the other two.

03:34.640 --> 03:40.040
And well, I spent, I think, the first six months with those three.

03:40.040 --> 03:48.600
Then check what was again, check went to the job hunting and check that, okay, those three

03:48.600 --> 03:49.600
are not enough.

03:49.600 --> 03:55.240
You need to, most of the jobs are requiring frameworks.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.480
So let's go and learn frameworks.

03:57.480 --> 04:02.900
And it was like a deep hole of frameworks, like a lot of them.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.720
And I went with the most popular one at that time, which was React.

04:06.720 --> 04:10.920
And well, there was the typing with TypeScript, and also there was the state management with

04:10.920 --> 04:15.080
Redux, and some other tools with CSS.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.080
So I learned plenty.

04:16.080 --> 04:22.800
At the end of the year, it was 2018, at the end of 2018, I start to feel the pressure

04:22.800 --> 04:26.520
like, okay, okay, it's enough with learning.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.840
You really need to land the job.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.720
You cannot just continue doing that.

04:30.720 --> 04:36.400
And yeah, I started sending application at the end of that time.

04:36.400 --> 04:42.280
That's when I really found myself like, this is the most difficult part.

04:42.280 --> 04:51.640
And it's a company or a team trusting someone that just is entering the industry, that doesn't

04:51.640 --> 04:54.320
have any professional experience, and it was very difficult.

04:54.320 --> 05:03.280
I sent hundreds of applications, a lot of gusting, no answer, nothing, no feedback.

05:03.280 --> 05:07.360
And that's difficult for you to improve yourself when you don't have any feedback, as you think

05:07.360 --> 05:08.360
what you're doing wrong.

05:08.360 --> 05:13.200
A good thing is that there are many groups out there, so you get to see many stories

05:13.200 --> 05:15.560
like yours.

05:15.560 --> 05:21.480
You get to know what you did wrong, and just perseverance, just keep applying, keep applying,

05:21.480 --> 05:29.240
keep improving over what you have done before, improving your CV, your resume.

05:29.240 --> 05:33.400
And I think there was like two or three, I think three interviews before I landed the

05:33.400 --> 05:35.680
first job, fortunately.

05:35.680 --> 05:41.240
And in the same, in the three interviews, I was able to learn what I did wrong.

05:41.240 --> 05:48.240
I knew that even if you reach the last step of the interview process, because you are

05:48.240 --> 05:52.240
starting and you don't have a professional career, that's going to impact you.

05:52.240 --> 05:57.040
And if there is someone that doesn't know, doesn't have the skills that you have, but

05:57.040 --> 06:01.880
he has a professional experience, they are going to go with that one.

06:01.880 --> 06:08.360
So I thought to myself like, what can you do to overcome that?

06:08.360 --> 06:16.240
And then I started with open source contributions, I started with Mozilla, and there is plenty

06:16.240 --> 06:25.400
of repos, plenty of projects where you can contribute there, there's also a small anecdote

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
about that.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.400
We'll talk about that later on.

06:29.400 --> 06:38.200
And then when I got the IO or Adblock plus interviews, when I sent my application, they

06:38.200 --> 06:39.200
sent me back.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.240
And when I received the first answer, I was like, okay, I need to impress them in one

06:42.240 --> 06:45.440
way, I need to highlight myself.

06:45.440 --> 06:52.320
So what I did was find out was, fortunately, they offer all this information to the public.

06:52.320 --> 06:56.760
So I was able to find out what was the team that I was going to work on.

06:56.760 --> 07:00.960
What was the project that I was going to, meant to work?

07:00.960 --> 07:07.520
And it was in GitLab, and it's still in GitLab, with a mirror in GitHub.

07:07.520 --> 07:12.400
And I started to check and like, okay, I have one week, I need to learn the basics of how

07:12.400 --> 07:16.440
to go through the code base, get a little bit of phone overview.

07:16.440 --> 07:22.920
Then after the week, I got the first assessment, and while I was doing the thing, that was

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
very short.

07:23.920 --> 07:31.880
I think it took me three hours, four hours the most, it's a small webpage that I needed

07:31.880 --> 07:33.740
to do.

07:33.740 --> 07:38.960
And I also in parallel, I was already trying to make a contribution, was like a goal for

07:38.960 --> 07:39.960
me.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.080
Like before I get the technical interview, I need to make a contribution to them, like

07:44.080 --> 07:46.480
a merge request or pull request.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.480
And I need to have it landed.

07:49.480 --> 07:56.440
And yeah, I was able to finish the merge request, and it wasn't approved at that time, because

07:56.440 --> 07:59.840
there was another priorities, but at least they were able to see it.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.920
They were able to see my skills, yeah.

08:02.920 --> 08:08.960
And then it was like, okay, I'm going to have the merge request, sorry, the interview, I

08:08.960 --> 08:09.960
need for another one.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.360
I mean, I shouldn't stop here.

08:11.360 --> 08:21.360
I don't have any, I couldn't leave anything to, yeah, I could be more than prepared for

08:21.360 --> 08:22.360
all this.

08:22.360 --> 08:28.160
So I ended up making two more merge requests, and the interview also, when they asked me

08:28.160 --> 08:31.720
about some stuff, I also made reference for the merge request, like, okay, I did this

08:31.720 --> 08:34.200
and I did that.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.400
I didn't limit myself to only have this back finish.

08:37.400 --> 08:46.000
I also tried to consider different scenarios, different cases for the user, and that helped.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.080
Now that I'm working with them, and I'm part of the team, and I have seen also other process

08:51.080 --> 08:57.920
of the hiring, I know that it was very difficult to trust someone that was just starting and

08:57.920 --> 09:01.200
was changing career, and it was like one year and a half.

09:01.200 --> 09:07.840
So it was a difficult decision, and I understand other companies that also don't trust that

09:07.840 --> 09:08.840
much them.

09:08.840 --> 09:14.800
I don't think it's ideal, but I understand the reasons.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.840
And yeah, at the end, through all the process, they gave me an opportunity.

09:19.840 --> 09:24.840
And after three years already, I just completed the three years, I'm still working with them.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.780
Very happy, they were all the time very supportive.

09:28.780 --> 09:37.680
They understood that I was just starting, very patient, and yeah, that's more of it.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
That's great.

09:38.680 --> 09:44.120
There's a lot of gems and some really good information and guidance in there.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.240
Kudos on how you've approached this whole process.

09:47.240 --> 09:51.320
I think it was very, very mature and very well thought through.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.600
I think a lot of people can learn a lot from that.

09:54.600 --> 10:00.400
I was going to ask the question about the interview process probably later on, but seeing

10:00.400 --> 10:04.680
that you've touched on this already, maybe we can dig into it a little bit now.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.960
I think you've made some really good points.

10:07.960 --> 10:14.640
I've previously spoken with somebody called Ian Douglas, he's a career coach, and he also

10:14.640 --> 10:20.840
gave a lot of good information about what a recruit is looking for.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.960
And I think it's very important to understand that, because if you understand that, you

10:23.960 --> 10:31.480
can tailor the way you approach applying for jobs better, because even though you did mention

10:31.480 --> 10:38.520
that you sent out a lot of resumes to a lot of different companies, I think that is one

10:38.520 --> 10:39.520
way of doing it.

10:39.520 --> 10:45.520
But the other way of doing it is trying to find, let me stay back a little bit.

10:45.520 --> 10:50.040
So there's a lot of opportunity right now in the software industry, whether that be

10:50.040 --> 10:56.040
web development or machine learning or AI or any of these things, blockchain, there's

10:56.040 --> 10:59.160
a lot of demand and there's a shortage of skills.

10:59.160 --> 11:04.480
So it's kind of a really good time to get into this industry if it's something you're

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
interested in.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.440
I think that's something to be highlighted.

11:07.440 --> 11:13.640
Don't just get into tech because you think it's going to be some utopia that you're

11:13.640 --> 11:14.640
entering.

11:14.640 --> 11:20.440
You need to have a true interest and the love for problem solving and struggling and writing

11:20.440 --> 11:26.320
code and trying to fix problems, failing, trying again, failing, trying again.

11:26.320 --> 11:31.160
But then when it comes down to applying, I think you can be a little picky now.

11:31.160 --> 11:38.320
You can kind of look for companies that interest you, the work they do, the culture they have,

11:38.320 --> 11:45.040
that kind of thing, and then really tailor your resume to the company.

11:45.040 --> 11:50.880
And I think all that research you did about who is AdBlock and what do they do and oh

11:50.880 --> 11:51.880
yes, they're good.

11:51.880 --> 11:52.880
Oh wow, it's open source.

11:52.880 --> 11:57.880
I can actually contribute to this, actually contributing to work that they're doing.

11:57.880 --> 12:02.240
I think that was a brilliant move on your part.

12:02.240 --> 12:08.080
So I think that was the good experience that you had at the tail end.

12:08.080 --> 12:12.040
But is there some things earlier on that you found?

12:12.040 --> 12:17.180
I think you mentioned some of this where you felt ghosted sometimes and you didn't get

12:17.180 --> 12:23.040
feedback from the recruiters about why you weren't even given an interview or something

12:23.040 --> 12:24.040
like that.

12:24.040 --> 12:28.760
Is there anything, any other things you'd like to bring up that you found during the

12:28.760 --> 12:33.960
interview process that you felt was not ideal or even completely broken?

12:33.960 --> 12:39.040
And do you have any ideas about how recruiters and companies can improve that?

12:39.040 --> 12:40.040
Yeah.

12:40.040 --> 12:44.200
So before we reach that question, I wanted to make a comment about what you just mentioned

12:44.200 --> 12:51.920
about tailoring the, but you are partially right about tailoring the interaction with

12:51.920 --> 12:55.440
the company that you are interviewing with.

12:55.440 --> 13:03.520
What I'm not that in favor, and it's because we are not considering completely the experience

13:03.520 --> 13:08.800
that a early stage developer has, it's about tailoring the resume.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.040
Because I have heard also multiple times like, hey, you should send a specific resume to

13:13.040 --> 13:18.120
every one of the companies, just remove everything that is not meant for the company, just focus

13:18.120 --> 13:19.120
on that one.

13:19.120 --> 13:26.800
The problem is that, I mean, the people that have go through standard academic learning

13:26.800 --> 13:32.560
stuff, universities or this kind of engineer schools, or the ones that have finished like

13:32.560 --> 13:36.880
a bootcamp, that kind of thing, they have very little to add in their resume.

13:36.880 --> 13:43.800
Most of them is like small projects that everyone did, and they tried to add it like that in

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
their resume.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.840
I also did that.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.880
And so there is not much to remove from the resume, unfortunately.

13:50.880 --> 13:54.080
And yeah, the companies are going just to ignore it because it's the same everywhere.

13:54.080 --> 14:00.400
It's a very, I mean, if you focus on what the company wants, it's very little what they

14:00.400 --> 14:02.120
can get from that.

14:02.120 --> 14:06.520
That's also something that I noticed that when I started, they were like, hey, I have

14:06.520 --> 14:09.800
this skill, I can do this and I can do that.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.320
But I wasn't in the mindset like what the company wants from me, what can I do for the

14:14.320 --> 14:15.320
company?

14:15.320 --> 14:21.200
And I have noticed that mindset in many people that are finishing their careers, that they

14:21.200 --> 14:25.600
are like, hey, I'm good at this and I'm good at that.

14:25.600 --> 14:31.360
But they don't go and say, I can help you team with this, I can do this for this.

14:31.360 --> 14:36.560
I have noticed that this company does this, I can do this for you.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.560
And we need to change that.

14:37.560 --> 14:42.400
It's not mentioned that much out there, unfortunately, but that's something that recruiters really

14:42.400 --> 14:44.920
appreciate.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.600
Things that I learned about, well, there are bad and good things.

14:48.600 --> 14:52.320
One, for example, there's a lot of stuff.

14:52.320 --> 14:59.520
There is one that there is a lot of opportunities out there that are coming out, popping up,

14:59.520 --> 15:04.120
but they are specific to certain groups, which is very nice.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.360
But you cannot cover all the groups.

15:07.360 --> 15:15.880
In my case, I was established in Mexico and didn't have many opportunities, especially

15:15.880 --> 15:16.880
for remote jobs.

15:16.880 --> 15:20.280
I was trying to target European or USA market.

15:20.280 --> 15:25.880
It was just very difficult, almost impossible.

15:25.880 --> 15:32.320
And there was some initiatives, I think one of them was, there was one that approached

15:32.320 --> 15:37.800
for Mozilla and it's quite popular.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.200
I think you mentioned in one of the podcasts for outreach, that one.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.760
So I get to hear about that and I applied to that one.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.680
And unfortunately, I got rejected, but that didn't stop me.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.660
I was like, okay, this is the nice thing about working in the open.

15:52.660 --> 15:57.160
They publish everything, all the candidates, which companies were accepting them.

15:57.160 --> 16:03.600
You were like, okay, and even more, which team was going to work with these people that

16:03.600 --> 16:04.860
were selected?

16:04.860 --> 16:09.000
So I was like, okay, what I can get from this is that these teams and these companies are

16:09.000 --> 16:13.860
open to help out early career developers to grow.

16:13.860 --> 16:20.560
So I target Mozilla and I noticed like, okay, this team, which was a very internal tools

16:20.560 --> 16:24.800
team, I did some contribution, I think over a dozen contributions there.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.680
I forgot already the name of the repo.

16:27.680 --> 16:35.800
So they accepted one person in outreach and I was like, okay, I went to the repo, I checked

16:35.800 --> 16:38.720
and the person was already helping out in the process.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.520
I mean, this person had access to all the internal communication.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.680
I didn't, it was only the GitHub.

16:45.680 --> 16:51.320
But I started also, along with this person, even if I wasn't going to receive the compensation,

16:51.320 --> 16:55.320
the support, I was like, I'm going through the experience at least.

16:55.320 --> 16:59.520
And I started with a person at the same time and we were like contributing, both of us

16:59.520 --> 17:03.760
were contributing following the process, the difference is that the other person was internal

17:03.760 --> 17:07.200
communication and compensation.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.960
But then it was super nice because one of the administrators of the repo sent me an

17:11.960 --> 17:18.800
invitation for, at that time, IRC, I don't remember which server, but IRC channel.

17:18.800 --> 17:24.400
And I was able to like, able to store the local chat and the chatting locally, like

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
keep it persistent.

17:25.400 --> 17:30.680
So I was able to communicate with them and I got to learn a lot.

17:30.680 --> 17:34.880
It was a React project, if I remember correctly.

17:34.880 --> 17:39.680
And I was with them, I think three months, something like that, the full experience and

17:39.680 --> 17:43.880
all the other stuff, I ended up adding into the resume.

17:43.880 --> 17:48.200
I wasn't outreach, I didn't mention any outreach stuff, but the contribution I was able to.

17:48.200 --> 17:53.360
So that's one of the things that I try to recommend to the people out there is that

17:53.360 --> 18:00.440
yes, compensations are important, but even if you are not able, if you are not selected,

18:00.440 --> 18:06.960
you need to make the most out of it and try to take the opportunity, at least learning

18:06.960 --> 18:08.680
for other people that are out there.

18:08.680 --> 18:13.120
And all this, do this, all this kind of research.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.960
So that's one of the things that I did.

18:15.960 --> 18:29.280
Good things that the people that interviewers check and it's self-learning, they have initiative.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.960
Depending on the company, I was lucky with the open source.

18:31.960 --> 18:37.240
If you mentioned this, because the recruiters are going like give a fast overview.

18:37.240 --> 18:41.920
So if you have made contributions to open source, be clear to put those ones at the

18:41.920 --> 18:47.120
top and mention the big companies like Mozilla, mentioning that, even if you did like a small

18:47.120 --> 18:52.720
contribution, you can talk later on about that with them.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.160
Make it short.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.160
Some people make like three pages of resume.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.440
They don't have times, recruiters to check all of that.

18:59.440 --> 19:04.840
So make it short, one page, very, very small, all this kind of stuff.

19:04.840 --> 19:09.200
For example, if the tails, like the URLs, and if you can just add the link into the

19:09.200 --> 19:14.480
PDF, that would be nice instead of putting the full stuff.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.800
Team skills, soft skills, they look for that.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.800
Don't try to present yourself like a very smart person.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
Be humble.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.800
There is always someone that has more knowledge out there than you.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.600
And a lot of people have more knowledge than you.

19:28.600 --> 19:37.200
And I think that, me as a starter, when I started the job, I think that was the skill

19:37.200 --> 19:40.800
that they appreciate the most.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.680
And it was like, I really wanted to learn.

19:43.680 --> 19:49.080
I was like, hey, because they emphasize on that, like, what do you think?

19:49.080 --> 19:50.080
Do you know?

19:50.080 --> 19:51.080
How much do you know?

19:51.080 --> 19:57.160
And I was like, I know, but I know all of, I see all of you and you have a lot of knowledge

19:57.160 --> 20:03.040
and I will be very happy to get a little bit of that knowledge to help out the team.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.280
So it's all about the team.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.280
It's not about you.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.560
It's about the team, making the team better.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.400
You become better and the team and some becoming better also.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.400
So yeah.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.400
Yeah, no, I agree.

20:14.400 --> 20:21.000
I think it is important to talk about what value would you add to the team as an individual.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.880
Not so much just what you can do technically, but the soft skills.

20:26.880 --> 20:27.960
I think that's very important.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.840
I think that's one of the things that you get from open source is you get to show that

20:31.840 --> 20:34.520
you're able to work in a team.

20:34.520 --> 20:39.120
You're able to follow guidance, you're able to take feedback constructively, you know,

20:39.120 --> 20:43.480
you don't like rage quit and like close the pull request kind of thing.

20:43.480 --> 20:49.560
If somebody disagreed with something that you said, and I think sometimes also what

20:49.560 --> 20:57.520
shows a lot of your character is if maybe you opened a pull request and the people from

20:57.520 --> 21:01.600
the repository or the project came back and they said, ah, you know what, this is not

21:01.600 --> 21:03.760
really something we want to do at this point.

21:03.760 --> 21:07.520
So unfortunately we're going to close this pull request, but thanks so much.

21:07.520 --> 21:10.960
And there are some other ways, other things you can contribute on and they point you towards

21:10.960 --> 21:16.520
it and people can see that you actually went and took something else and took that, opened

21:16.520 --> 21:18.800
that one and got that merged.

21:18.800 --> 21:23.040
I think that shows a lot of character that you're able to take feedback, not take it

21:23.040 --> 21:28.920
personally and they move on and take the guidance and find the things that the company actually

21:28.920 --> 21:35.560
or the project actually feels is useful contributions or valuable contributions, I should say.

21:35.560 --> 21:40.040
And that you are able to do that, that you're not just saying, oh, no, this is a bad experience.

21:40.040 --> 21:46.920
I feel like, oh, I can't deal with this and I'm going to move on because part of work

21:46.920 --> 21:51.520
is getting feedback.

21:51.520 --> 21:56.680
All or most companies these days works through some kind of pull request flow.

21:56.680 --> 22:04.640
So your code is going to be reviewed by peers and there are going to be people who have

22:04.640 --> 22:10.600
more knowledge on a specific topic than you and might be able to help you by telling you,

22:10.600 --> 22:15.920
oh, you know what, there's a better way to do this or wow, this component is getting

22:15.920 --> 22:16.920
really big.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.600
I think you should split it up into three separate components that each just do one

22:20.600 --> 22:23.080
thing really well.

22:23.080 --> 22:28.180
And I think being able to take that kind of guidance and acknowledge it and not just give

22:28.180 --> 22:33.320
up because people give them just say, yeah, this is perfect and most full request, I think

22:33.320 --> 22:34.320
that shows a lot.

22:34.320 --> 22:39.240
So going through that process, I think is important.

22:39.240 --> 22:46.800
So I'm wondering, you have a lot of enthusiasm and you have a lot of, what is the word I'm

22:46.800 --> 22:47.800
looking for?

22:47.800 --> 22:50.960
You don't give up easily.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.760
I think that that is something that I've learned about you in this short while that we've been

22:54.760 --> 22:55.760
talking so far.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.880
And I think that's also important.

22:57.880 --> 22:58.880
Don't give up.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.640
If this is really something you want, you have to keep going.

23:01.640 --> 23:06.800
You have to roll with the punches as they say, sometimes things aren't going to quite

23:06.800 --> 23:12.120
go your way, but see what you can take from the experience and learn to use somewhere

23:12.120 --> 23:13.120
else.

23:13.120 --> 23:16.120
Maybe this wasn't the right company or the right like outreach.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.040
Maybe that wasn't the right vehicle for you.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.240
Maybe you need to find something else.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.320
I think it is hard.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.320
It is hard.

23:23.320 --> 23:30.200
I mean, it's human nature that if you keep putting yourself out there and you feel like

23:30.200 --> 23:33.920
you keep getting rejected, you do lose motivation.

23:33.920 --> 23:36.280
You do start to think, is it me?

23:36.280 --> 23:38.000
It's not the industry.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
It's not the company.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
It's not the project.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
It's me.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
It's something wrong with me.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
So I wonder, what do you do?

23:43.000 --> 23:53.480
Is there some like, I don't know, resources, books, people, anything like that, that makes

23:53.480 --> 23:57.320
you able to be so persistent and to be so resilient?

23:57.320 --> 24:04.240
Well, about the resilience per se, it's difficult to give an advice on that.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.000
It's just simple to say like, don't give up.

24:06.000 --> 24:13.440
I felt a little bit down when I was rejected, but not a little bit, a lot, but you get used

24:13.440 --> 24:14.440
to it.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.760
I mean, you just keep trying and then it's like normal.

24:18.760 --> 24:26.480
Obviously, you need to learn from that, but try to improve yourself.

24:26.480 --> 24:30.920
I think what made me, I didn't have like this kind of network.

24:30.920 --> 24:36.880
Still, many people were recommending like, hey, make a network in the social places and

24:36.880 --> 24:39.840
you will get a lot of people out there and you will end up landing a job.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.520
I'm not good at that, unfortunately.

24:42.520 --> 24:47.120
What I found out was that it was very nice to have these communities of people.

24:47.120 --> 24:52.480
There's a lot of people from different countries that are trying to do exactly the same.

24:52.480 --> 24:53.480
They see the opportunity.

24:53.480 --> 24:58.120
There's a lot of benefits from that.

24:58.120 --> 25:03.400
And they really want to just get the first job.

25:03.400 --> 25:09.560
And that's what helped me out to keep going.

25:09.560 --> 25:13.760
There is a place that later on, well, I can recommend already, but there are multiple

25:13.760 --> 25:14.760
places like that.

25:14.760 --> 25:20.160
I mean, you have the network that you started this year, the Miscellaneous Network, that's

25:20.160 --> 25:21.160
very nice.

25:21.160 --> 25:26.440
There is another one that at that time I got to know and it has plenty of followers, Chingu,

25:26.440 --> 25:29.320
the Chingu Project.

25:29.320 --> 25:38.680
The nice thing about that place is that they simulate like kind of teamwork with kind of

25:38.680 --> 25:41.800
an agile thing.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.800
And that helps out.

25:42.800 --> 25:46.560
Like, you need to establish your goals, what you want to finish.

25:46.560 --> 25:51.280
You have a team of a designer, developer, project manager, all that kind of stuff.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.440
And it's for free.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.280
All that is for free.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.560
I think I learned from free.

25:56.560 --> 26:00.920
They didn't have that much money, so I was like, yeah, I cannot afford just investing

26:00.920 --> 26:01.920
at that time.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.800
And I use sense for the rest.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800
There is a lot of free resources.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.800
That's the nice thing.

26:05.800 --> 26:11.000
So I think the support from the people that was helped the most, like seeing, talking

26:11.000 --> 26:17.200
to each other like, hey, I had this interview when it didn't go that well, let's keep going.

26:17.200 --> 26:21.160
And complaining to each other like, hey, why are they not giving opportunity to people

26:21.160 --> 26:22.160
like us?

26:22.160 --> 26:26.160
Because the companies are saying that there is not enough developers out there.

26:26.160 --> 26:30.720
So all that kind of stuff gives you a little bit of confidence.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.720
And you just keep trying.

26:31.720 --> 26:32.720
Find a way.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.400
Like you say, don't give up.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.400
Find your way.

26:35.400 --> 26:39.520
Each person has a way to learn and achieve their goals.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.160
Just feel comfortable at that.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.640
Now, places to learn.

26:44.640 --> 26:49.400
I don't remember what was the first one, but for certain, the one that I used the most

26:49.400 --> 26:53.120
in the first years of the learning process was MDN.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.440
There was a quite well structure.

26:55.440 --> 27:02.520
I mean, I went through at that time through the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript handbook guides

27:02.520 --> 27:04.440
and stuff.

27:04.440 --> 27:10.840
I think something nice about those guides and compared to another ones is that they

27:10.840 --> 27:14.920
really care for accessibility, for example.

27:14.920 --> 27:23.320
They really care about using the things right, using the proper elements, not just fill everything

27:23.320 --> 27:26.240
with deep containers or span containers.

27:26.240 --> 27:31.520
They were really emphasizing about making things in a proper way.

27:31.520 --> 27:37.960
And that, because I learned it in a very early stage of my career, that stick with me.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.800
And I'm still doing it in the job.

27:39.800 --> 27:44.400
I'm like always trying to emphasize whatever I develop or whatever I review, I dedicate

27:44.400 --> 27:50.720
more time to check all those kinds of stuff, accessibility, one of them.

27:50.720 --> 27:59.920
So MDN, I still do it, use it a lot, especially for checking APIs, if I'm doing it right,

27:59.920 --> 28:06.160
if it's one argument or two arguments, the number of stuff that this requires.

28:06.160 --> 28:10.720
Another one that I recommend, and I think it's not that popular, a little bit of a pity,

28:10.720 --> 28:17.160
is JavaScript info, JavaScript.info, it's for JavaScript only, it's quite well structured.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.600
And I like it a lot.

28:18.600 --> 28:24.480
I don't use it that much nowadays, but for learning, it's pretty good.

28:24.480 --> 28:30.160
And well, in general, just any search engine, whatever doubts you have, whatever problem

28:30.160 --> 28:36.000
you have, just search there, just keep an eye on the dates and whatever they recommend,

28:36.000 --> 28:41.520
if it's up to date, the browser compatibility, the version, if maybe you can use a better

28:41.520 --> 28:48.680
API or a different CSS rule thingish, whatever.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.320
So just keep an eye on the dates.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.040
This thing changes quite often.

28:53.040 --> 28:58.860
So yeah, I know JavaScript.info has been mentioned by a couple of folks actually.

28:58.860 --> 29:03.120
So it's interesting that there isn't more focus on that.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.240
I hadn't looked at it.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.080
I kind of knew about it, but I haven't really looked at it.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.920
And having so many people mention it, I did have a look at it and it is really good.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.880
It is really, really good.

29:12.880 --> 29:17.560
I would definitely encourage a lot of people to check it out, especially if you're early

29:17.560 --> 29:21.740
on still learning, think it's a good resource.

29:21.740 --> 29:25.680
So I think you've highlighted some of the resources that again, like I mentioned, I've

29:25.680 --> 29:32.440
heard a lot of other people mention, and I think MDN is the guidebook for the web.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.800
That is the intent.

29:33.800 --> 29:34.800
That's what it's meant for.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
It's why it's around.

29:35.800 --> 29:39.080
It's why it's so popular.

29:39.080 --> 29:45.360
But I do think that I've learned, and I want to hear your side of this, and I don't want

29:45.360 --> 29:53.560
to talk about it too much from my side, but I've heard a lot of feedback regarding gaps

29:53.560 --> 29:56.860
with the learning experience.

29:56.860 --> 30:02.760
So without leading you down a specific road, I'm just going to kind of put it at that.

30:02.760 --> 30:06.400
What struggles have you had when you learned, like, yeah, there's these great resources

30:06.400 --> 30:11.800
out there like MDN and JavaScript Info, but what are the challenges that you faced when

30:11.800 --> 30:12.800
learning?

30:12.800 --> 30:22.520
So divided by my parts in my career is starting, it was like finding the resources that I need

30:22.520 --> 30:23.520
to learn.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.560
That wasn't that difficult.

30:25.560 --> 30:31.480
I think the first struggle was like what to do after, because you get like these basics

30:31.480 --> 30:36.560
and then you get yourself with a lot of frameworks and like, which one am I going to learn?

30:36.560 --> 30:39.640
Because I really considered at that time, I didn't know how many were out there.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.040
And I was like, I'm going to learn all of them.

30:42.040 --> 30:48.720
And then later on you find out, and every year or even short of the time, one pops out.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.560
So no, you are not going to.

30:50.560 --> 30:55.440
You need to focus on something and work on that.

30:55.440 --> 31:00.960
And later on you can improve or learn something else, but you need to make your choices.

31:00.960 --> 31:12.280
There is a lot of places, either YouTube, either communities, even companies that provide

31:12.280 --> 31:18.160
this kind of learning paths by you need to pay a little bit.

31:18.160 --> 31:24.720
There's a lot of demand at the moment, a lot of products and business out there doing this

31:24.720 --> 31:27.000
because of the demand problem.

31:27.000 --> 31:38.560
And what I see on all of them is that they try to make you learn either a frame or something

31:38.560 --> 31:46.000
super fast, but they are lacking the professional experience, the real practice.

31:46.000 --> 31:53.080
You end up being able to replicate, for example, an example, a project example, either a website

31:53.080 --> 31:54.640
or either an app.

31:54.640 --> 32:02.080
You can replicate, you do it exactly the same as it was done there, but you don't have initiative.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.680
Not all the time it's about creating something from scratch.

32:04.680 --> 32:09.480
Most of the time it's about giving maintenance to something that has already been done.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.120
And that's rarely touched.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.500
You don't see that much of a stuff.

32:13.500 --> 32:16.160
So it will be nice to take these people.

32:16.160 --> 32:21.920
I mean, I'm in love with open source stuff, with open source project.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.200
There is a lot of them.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.760
It's getting more and more popular out there.

32:24.760 --> 32:31.640
Just take these people that are coming out of any learning process and help them out

32:31.640 --> 32:34.720
to contribute, to get experience there.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.440
Both are going to be a win-win.

32:36.440 --> 32:41.280
The people that are behind the project are going to either improve their documentation,

32:41.280 --> 32:46.880
for example, to facilitate the contribution or even better, maybe a mesh request, something

32:46.880 --> 32:48.800
fixed, maybe in the future, who knows?

32:48.800 --> 32:54.920
Also, they will be able to see the people that are coming out from this learning process

32:54.920 --> 33:01.800
and consider them, having consideration about picking up some of them to a future opportunity.

33:01.800 --> 33:09.320
And also, all of us gets to learn how it is to work in a team and how it is to work not

33:09.320 --> 33:16.000
just in a team, also in real cases scenario, fixing stuff, giving maintenance.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.840
So that's the initial stuff.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.240
Then it comes ghosting with the interviews.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.960
I don't see the solution there.

33:23.960 --> 33:31.360
The only thing, there was a case that is still in my mind, and I think it's quite a bad practice.

33:31.360 --> 33:39.960
There was a company that wanted to help, or maybe have a little bit of popularity, want

33:39.960 --> 33:42.560
to help the beginners out there.

33:42.560 --> 33:50.840
So this company made a post and a social network, and I said like, hey, we have a vacancy, we

33:50.840 --> 33:52.320
have an opportunity.

33:52.320 --> 33:57.400
I think it was only one for early development, people with zero experience.

33:57.400 --> 34:01.600
No, the post got super popular.

34:01.600 --> 34:08.040
And the thing is that I apply, and a lot of people apply also, later on I got to know

34:08.040 --> 34:12.800
them, if I remember correctly, they say that they had over 1,000 applicants.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.240
So they were struggling a lot to process all of them.

34:16.240 --> 34:22.160
So it just not made difficult for them, but also for us, because it was complete ghosting.

34:22.160 --> 34:26.320
Like you didn't get any information.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.600
You got the interviews, they went through the interviews of many people, of hundreds

34:29.600 --> 34:30.600
of people.

34:30.600 --> 34:31.600
Interviews of hundreds.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.600
That's so difficult.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.000
It was super fast.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.280
They told me, like, we are interviewing these hundreds of people, and they were like, oh

34:39.280 --> 34:44.960
my God, five, 10 minutes, very fast, and obviously they are going to forget about you.

34:44.960 --> 34:50.960
I don't know how they ended up with the selection, and yeah, this is one of them.

34:50.960 --> 34:57.760
I think not us, candidates should focus on the companies that want to work, but also

34:57.760 --> 35:03.240
the companies that are trying to select the people, they also should put a little bit

35:03.240 --> 35:04.240
more of dedication.

35:04.240 --> 35:09.480
Difficult, I know, but just give a little bit of feedback.

35:09.480 --> 35:17.520
In the case of us in AdBlock Plus, I have also been nowadays with interaction with some

35:17.520 --> 35:22.720
hiring process, and I have noticed that a candidate is requested, but they want to learn

35:22.720 --> 35:23.720
about that.

35:23.720 --> 35:29.840
It's not just getting the job, it's I want something out of this, and we try to push

35:29.840 --> 35:34.600
for that, we provide, like, hey, we like this from you, and we think that you can improve

35:34.600 --> 35:36.880
this, this other thing.

35:36.880 --> 35:42.880
So that's the second thing that I struggled, which was gusting and being able to learn,

35:42.880 --> 35:46.500
work on while being blind on the part.

35:46.500 --> 35:52.560
Then it comes a lot of stuff, then it comes the first months in the job, I think it's

35:52.560 --> 35:56.760
something that is good to know, because most of us will struggle with that, and most of

35:56.760 --> 35:57.760
us won't be able.

35:57.760 --> 36:05.600
I have, unfortunately, I have seen cases where after all this hard work and stress, they

36:05.600 --> 36:10.760
get their jobs, and they find out that the job is even more stressful than anything else,

36:10.760 --> 36:16.920
and they either quit or they are not able to keep the job after weeks or maybe months,

36:16.920 --> 36:20.880
and that's a little bit disappointing, because that's going to break a lot of people out

36:20.880 --> 36:23.800
there, and it's quite bad.

36:23.800 --> 36:33.080
So that's something that you need to be prepared, and it's the imposter syndrome, which is quite

36:33.080 --> 36:39.040
mentioned out there, and it's that you will feel like you are there just by luck, that

36:39.040 --> 36:45.080
they made a mistake choosing you, that, yeah, I still also feel it.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.480
You get used to it.

36:47.480 --> 36:50.840
It's just, in my case, it's like, if I feel that, it's because I still have something

36:50.840 --> 36:53.720
to learn, and that's exciting.

36:53.720 --> 37:00.400
So I went through that the first six months, and the fear, they are going to fire me, and

37:00.400 --> 37:05.880
they will notice that I'm not the person that they were looking for, and instead of being

37:05.880 --> 37:10.520
able to focus to do your job, instead of being able to focus to learn from the other people,

37:10.520 --> 37:16.840
you were focused to not get fired, and I'm telling you, my team was amazing.

37:16.840 --> 37:22.520
They were like, all the time, we are not expecting you to walk this fast, we are not expecting

37:22.520 --> 37:27.560
all, we are expecting only for you to learn, to learn from the team.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.840
They clearly say, take your time.

37:29.840 --> 37:30.840
That was amazing.

37:30.840 --> 37:35.400
Yeah, but it's still in me, like, no, no, no, I need to still finish stuff, and maybe

37:35.400 --> 37:39.880
they say that because they wanted to be kind, but yeah.

37:39.880 --> 37:43.080
And how did I overcame that?

37:43.080 --> 37:50.760
Well, like you said, just not give up, just be persistent, just try to, well, now what

37:50.760 --> 37:58.920
I feel is like, all the people that have a lot of knowledge, try to interact with them.

37:58.920 --> 38:05.680
The nice thing about this career, in general, development, is that most of the people are

38:05.680 --> 38:07.980
very, very kind.

38:07.980 --> 38:13.440
Most of the people want to teach others, and they are willing to explain, dedicate the

38:13.440 --> 38:17.080
time to explain how things work.

38:17.080 --> 38:22.120
So just go there as for help, get feedback from everyone.

38:22.120 --> 38:26.160
And when you have the opportunity to share stuff, express it.

38:26.160 --> 38:32.480
If the people, even if what you say is redundant with something else, or it doesn't make sense,

38:32.480 --> 38:36.080
express it, because it will help you out to improve in communication with something else

38:36.080 --> 38:37.080
that you need to learn.

38:37.080 --> 38:41.880
See, they've been able to communicate with the team.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.320
And well, yeah, two things could happen.

38:44.320 --> 38:48.680
In my company, it's like they were super nice, hearing me out.

38:48.680 --> 38:49.680
That's nice.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.280
And it could be that other people in other companies, they won't be that nice.

38:53.280 --> 38:56.000
And if that's the case, then maybe it's not the place for you.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.120
I struggle.

38:57.120 --> 39:02.360
And I think that was the thing that hit the most, because it stayed there for a long time.

39:02.360 --> 39:07.160
I think one year and a half, two years, like super stressed because of that.

39:07.160 --> 39:13.200
Then after time, you get to know like, okay, first idea to my money, like I love this job,

39:13.200 --> 39:17.040
the company's being that nice to me, but jobs are not forever.

39:17.040 --> 39:22.160
So you need to start focusing in things that will be more persistent in your lifetime,

39:22.160 --> 39:24.720
giving more priorities in your life.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.800
That is when the things get a little bit relaxed.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.800
And I mean, I'm still worried sometimes, but you get to relax.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.760
You have your times for relax.

39:34.760 --> 39:39.440
And nowadays, what I focus the most on, the challenge, one of the challenges is that I

39:39.440 --> 39:42.680
want to be more productive.

39:42.680 --> 39:49.440
I feel like, and I am slower than most of my peers or my developers.

39:49.440 --> 39:55.080
And we just had a discussion about what could be the reasons of that.

39:55.080 --> 40:00.840
It's not like they requested for me, like they didn't say that, but I felt that.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.800
And it's all about how you focus on stuff.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.440
It's all about how you prioritize things.

40:05.440 --> 40:10.400
Sometimes you go too deep on something and you need to go a little bit wide.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.700
You need to have this kind of, later on I got to learn that you need to have this kind

40:13.700 --> 40:16.640
of time budget, that you don't have time for everything.

40:16.640 --> 40:20.840
If you had it initially for, you don't have time to learn everything from all the frameworks,

40:20.840 --> 40:26.380
now you don't have time for being able to go that deep into the code base, into an issue.

40:26.380 --> 40:30.760
Maybe you want the best solution, but considering the time.

40:30.760 --> 40:34.120
So yes, all these kinds of things you get to learn.

40:34.120 --> 40:37.360
And right now I'm working on that.

40:37.360 --> 40:43.600
I have felt improvement over the last weeks, but still I think there is a margin to learn

40:43.600 --> 40:45.600
things to learn from that.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.280
Yeah, that's a tricky one.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.040
It's something I still struggle with.

40:50.040 --> 40:55.840
I have tried so many tools and methodologies and stuff like that.

40:55.840 --> 41:00.040
This week, for example, the one I've heard about before and I haven't implemented it,

41:00.040 --> 41:02.440
which is the key part of it.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.280
Just reading about a productivity method doesn't make it happen.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.600
You actually have to implement it for it to work.

41:08.600 --> 41:13.040
So I've heard about the Eisenhower method, which is something I'm curious about explaining.

41:13.040 --> 41:16.960
And then I learned about this new one called the Moscow method.

41:16.960 --> 41:23.800
It's actually, it spells Moscow, but it's, it's actually an acronym.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.920
It's basically, what does it stand for?

41:25.920 --> 41:29.320
Let me see if I can see, derived from the letter of each.

41:29.320 --> 41:36.080
So M is must have, S is should have, C is could have, and W is won't have.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.440
And then if you make it into an acronym, it's Moscow.

41:39.440 --> 41:44.520
So it's very similar to the Eisenhower technique, but I guess it has subtle differences.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.080
So I'm kind of reading about that one as well.

41:47.080 --> 41:51.720
I've tried different tools to try and like give myself artificial deadlines and stuff

41:51.720 --> 41:55.360
like this, because I feel if I don't have a deadline, I'm always going to like just

41:55.360 --> 41:57.240
keep procrastinating on the thing.

41:57.240 --> 42:02.320
I'm going to keep diving into that deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.560
And so I'm going to overthink stuff.

42:04.560 --> 42:09.080
Like I'll look at a single element and like, is this really the right element?

42:09.080 --> 42:12.400
And like, while that's important, sometimes you have to like, say, you know, it's, it's

42:12.400 --> 42:13.400
good enough for now.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.400
Let's move on.

42:14.400 --> 42:17.720
We can put a little to-do note in there and we can come back and revisit it.

42:17.720 --> 42:22.720
So yeah, I totally get that and I agree.

42:22.720 --> 42:27.760
So we're kind of running out of time and there's two things, two or three things I'd like to

42:27.760 --> 42:28.760
touch on.

42:28.760 --> 42:35.680
So I'd say as much as you can or want to about this, but you mentioned earlier on that being

42:35.680 --> 42:41.840
from Mexico, you were targeting US and European countries, but you found it almost impossible.

42:41.840 --> 42:47.880
I think there's a lot of people in developing countries that faces the same problem where

42:47.880 --> 42:51.120
in their own country, jobs are very scarce.

42:51.120 --> 42:55.680
So they do want to reach out to the bigger global market.

42:55.680 --> 42:59.960
But especially when you're new, how do you even do that?

42:59.960 --> 43:03.440
Can you like, just dive into that a little bit?

43:03.440 --> 43:08.160
Like what were the challenges that you were facing and do you have any like ideas of what

43:08.160 --> 43:09.160
we can do?

43:09.160 --> 43:10.920
Is this a community thing that can help you?

43:10.920 --> 43:12.400
Can open source help you?

43:12.400 --> 43:14.760
Yeah, same goes with open source.

43:14.760 --> 43:19.720
I think, well, first I noticed that with USA was going to be a little bit more difficult.

43:19.720 --> 43:23.520
I got, I think one interview only.

43:23.520 --> 43:28.200
It was quite informal, it was usually the smaller the company, the more opportunities

43:28.200 --> 43:33.280
they give because the bigger they get, the more they need to follow like this kind of

43:33.280 --> 43:39.000
standards to not overcomplicate themselves with special cases of people outside of their

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
countries.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
So I noticed that.

43:41.000 --> 43:45.120
So yeah, there was a couple of opportunities in USA, but it was like a company that was

43:45.120 --> 43:46.120
going just to start.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.800
And then I still didn't get those.

43:47.800 --> 43:53.160
What I noticed is that Europe in general give more opportunity to people from outside of

43:53.160 --> 43:57.480
the area, at least from Mexico.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.360
I'm not certain of all the regions.

43:59.360 --> 44:02.080
I'm not certain about India, for example.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.800
I'm not certain about some African countries.

44:04.800 --> 44:09.680
I'm not certain about that, but at least from Mexico, I got to see that they were quite

44:09.680 --> 44:10.680
open to that.

44:10.680 --> 44:16.880
So it looks like they are not that strict with this process about this kind of payment.

44:16.880 --> 44:21.920
There is the freelance opportunity, it's your part of a company.

44:21.920 --> 44:29.080
You don't have all the benefits in a way of people that is on sites, like for example,

44:29.080 --> 44:34.220
health, insurance, all that kind of stuff, but they can still hire you as a freelancer

44:34.220 --> 44:37.960
and there's plenty of methods out there for payment.

44:37.960 --> 44:41.660
So it's about most of the policies that they follow.

44:41.660 --> 44:45.720
And yeah, in Europe, I found more opportunities and I got most of the interviews from there

44:45.720 --> 44:53.680
and where my company is from Germany, so yeah, it matches all what I saw before.

44:53.680 --> 44:58.960
And well, open source, it's like if you see that a company has plenty of projects that

44:58.960 --> 45:07.320
are out there, it means that they are open to or there will be more flexibility for people

45:07.320 --> 45:16.440
from outside of the company to get enrolled into the processes.

45:16.440 --> 45:20.920
They will be, again, they will be more open maybe to hire someone, maybe to share some

45:20.920 --> 45:21.920
stuff.

45:21.920 --> 45:27.460
They care for another, maybe for results, for the user experience, for the products,

45:27.460 --> 45:32.520
but not instead for like, only these people get to know about the process of the company.

45:32.520 --> 45:36.400
So it's working on the pop and if you search for a company that works in the open, that

45:36.400 --> 45:39.680
will give you more opportunities for you to get hired, personal experience.

45:39.680 --> 45:40.680
Yeah, that's good.

45:40.680 --> 45:41.680
That's good to know.

45:41.680 --> 45:42.680
Yeah.

45:42.680 --> 45:44.560
It's interesting that Europe is more open.

45:44.560 --> 45:45.560
Cool.

45:45.560 --> 45:46.560
So two things I want to touch on.

45:46.560 --> 45:50.240
I saw, I had a look at your GitHub and you've got quite a lot of stuff going on there, but

45:50.240 --> 45:53.880
there were two projects that kind of jumped out at me, but I don't know if you want to

45:53.880 --> 45:54.880
quickly touch on them.

45:54.880 --> 45:58.880
Again, I didn't look into them in detail, so I don't know how active you are still

45:58.880 --> 46:01.120
with these, but they just sounded interesting.

46:01.120 --> 46:06.600
The one is called Meet Your Lab and the other one is called Failed Coding Exercises.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.120
Well, the Failed Coding Exercises, I don't remember.

46:09.120 --> 46:12.560
First of all, I'm not active on GitHub, unfortunately.

46:12.560 --> 46:17.440
That's something that, as I'm struggling, that I'm trying to find the time for my side

46:17.440 --> 46:18.440
projects.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.480
There is a lot of side projects accumulated in the list.

46:21.480 --> 46:27.160
You mentioned before about the improvement stuff, about how we can get more productive.

46:27.160 --> 46:32.920
We have this stuff as developers is that, okay, we are thinking how to improve on something

46:32.920 --> 46:37.520
and we are already thinking about implementing something like, oh, I can create this application.

46:37.520 --> 46:41.120
We are tempted to create this stuff, even if it's out there already.

46:41.120 --> 46:44.640
So there is a big list to do.

46:44.640 --> 46:53.280
So now that GitHub, I'm trying to find a way to have time for me, not only the company

46:53.280 --> 46:54.280
stuff.

46:54.280 --> 46:58.560
Little by little, I'm getting better at that, but still I haven't reached the time to dedicate

46:58.560 --> 46:59.560
for my side projects.

46:59.560 --> 47:04.120
So the failing exercise, I don't even remember what it was.

47:04.120 --> 47:08.480
Another thing is GitHub is not the report where I work most nowadays.

47:08.480 --> 47:14.240
We work in GitLab, so we have moved to GitLab and I don't have mirrors, unfortunately, for

47:14.240 --> 47:15.640
my projects.

47:15.640 --> 47:24.200
So Met Your Live was about a project for Chingo, was one of the projects that we did there.

47:24.200 --> 47:31.120
It was React, TypeScript and Redux and I listed in the CV, but at the end, I think the open

47:31.120 --> 47:37.200
source contributions to Mozilla was what interested most to recruiters because it's this team

47:37.200 --> 47:38.680
working stuff.

47:38.680 --> 47:43.800
Also, but Chingo Interaction also helped, they asked me about that.

47:43.800 --> 47:49.280
There was another one, TabFX, which was an extension that I did a request from one of

47:49.280 --> 47:55.000
the interactions with MDN administrators, developers.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.120
We have the chat and the person said, it would be nice if we have this extension.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.880
And I was like, I can do that.

48:00.880 --> 48:03.360
And I said myself like, in one week, let's do this.

48:03.360 --> 48:04.360
And I was able to do it.

48:04.360 --> 48:06.720
The person used it and I improved it.

48:06.720 --> 48:10.180
I dedicate probably three months, four months of my attendance.

48:10.180 --> 48:14.520
I got only like 50 people using it the most now at ICC STEER team.

48:14.520 --> 48:19.240
Then I got the job and I wasn't able to keep working on that.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.240
Interesting.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.240
Yeah, no, it's hard.

48:21.240 --> 48:25.920
And I think we shouldn't break our backs to try and do side projects.

48:25.920 --> 48:31.800
But I think if it's an outlet for your own creativity, then it's great.

48:31.800 --> 48:37.640
But I don't think if you're already busy enough with work and you get all the satisfaction

48:37.640 --> 48:44.920
and you get to explore new technologies and new things as part of your day job, then I

48:44.920 --> 48:50.400
mean, you don't have to give yourself for that to do side projects.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.720
Thanks so much again, folks, for joining.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.520
I think this was a great conversation.

48:53.520 --> 48:56.680
There's a lot of insights that you've shared that I really think is going to help a lot

48:56.680 --> 48:57.840
of people.

48:57.840 --> 49:04.080
So just in closing, is there anything you'd like to mention, any last words, any advice

49:04.080 --> 49:09.800
that you'd like to give to early stage web developers and how can people find you on

49:09.800 --> 49:10.800
the internet?

49:10.800 --> 49:14.440
Yeah, Twitter, LinkedIn.

49:14.440 --> 49:20.040
I think nowadays I'm more active in LinkedIn, but yeah, Twitter also.

49:20.040 --> 49:26.960
I think you will share it in the notes, my handlers, and well, just for the companies

49:26.960 --> 49:35.440
and the teams out there, I know that it's difficult to get developers, there is a lot

49:35.440 --> 49:42.800
of demands and not that many with the skills that they want, but you need to dedicate a

49:42.800 --> 49:50.320
little bit of time to create these kinds of opportunities for early stage developers to

49:50.320 --> 49:55.720
interact with them and get to see the skills that you don't get in, I don't know, half

49:55.720 --> 49:58.920
an hour, one hour interview, it's impossible to get them.

49:58.920 --> 50:03.880
Most of the people like me are nervous half of the time in that interview.

50:03.880 --> 50:09.400
It doesn't need to, I mean, I highly recommend open source projects and give them this space

50:09.400 --> 50:11.520
for them to interact, but it doesn't need to be them.

50:11.520 --> 50:16.600
They can be like workshops also, they can be like hackathons, open hackathons where

50:16.600 --> 50:21.080
they can go there and it's mostly I think two weeks, three weeks that they can take

50:21.080 --> 50:28.320
from their normal workflow and I think they will find plenty of people that it may end

50:28.320 --> 50:35.960
up becoming part of their developers right away or maybe in one, two years they can keep

50:35.960 --> 50:40.680
an eye on them and see their role and hire them later.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.280
So yeah, have this space.

50:42.280 --> 50:45.720
Yeah, that's good advice, that's good advice.

50:45.720 --> 50:51.040
Thank you so much for joining me Adelson, this was a great, great chat.

50:51.040 --> 50:57.200
