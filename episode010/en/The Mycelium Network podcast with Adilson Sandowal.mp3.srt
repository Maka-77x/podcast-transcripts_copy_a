00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,840
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,320
Hey, Adelson.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,360
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,440
I'm so glad that you can join me.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
Thank you so much.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,440
Thank you for the invitation.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,600
It's totally my pleasure.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,600
So I know about you again, like many of the guests that I've spoken to before, through

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,680
the contributions you've made to MDN, that I've been involved with the review process

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:35,360
or making sure the right people look at your pull requests.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,560
But I think in those days, you were still kind of job hunting.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,280
But I know since then, you've landed a really good job that you're very happy at.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,800
So to get us started, can you give us a rundown of your background?

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,200
And I want you to take your time here, go back as far as you'd like and bring us up

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,960
to the current day.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,680
Yeah, sure.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,680
No problem.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:08,720
So I was a mathematics teacher for high school, almost nine years.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,960
And at the end of 2018, I decided to change career.

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,160
And the reason of that was mainly because I wanted more flexibility about the place

22
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,240
where I was able to work.

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,080
I was really, really excited about that kind of project.

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,040
I shared on the web about some jobs that could allow you that, and I really wanted it.

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,880
Another one was about increasing my income, because unfortunately, the job that I had

26
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,200
didn't pay that much.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:50,520
So before I finished or before I started the mathematics career, I was very good at programming

28
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,400
and mathematics.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,600
And so I thought, okay, I shouldn't complicate myself that much.

30
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,200
Let's go something related to programming.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,080
And at that time, the language that I was using the most was Python, mostly for scripts

32
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,320
about processing data and that kind of stuff.

33
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,560
So I didn't know anything about web development.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,180
I wanted to, but I didn't spend the time to learn about that.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,160
So I decided, okay, let's quit the job that I had and let's dedicate myself one year.

36
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,200
At that time, I said to myself, like, one year.

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,040
I think one year is going to be enough.

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,120
And now I was wrong about that.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,000
So I started and check about what was the requirement.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Check first about the options that we have about programming, how was the demand for

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
jobs.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,440
I realized that web development was the one that had more opportunities.

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,320
Also didn't mention, but one of the requirements was about not, because I took into consideration

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,120
the time that was going to take me, about not requiring academic certification.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
And web development was like, okay, we only need you to have the skills.

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,520
So yeah, I gathered like a kind of a small path, create a small path, like I need to

47
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,000
learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, JavaScript, mostly programming.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,440
I had already advantage of knowing programming, so that didn't take me that long.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,640
And the other two, well, there was plenty to learn for the other two.

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,040
And well, I spent, I think, the first six months with those three.

51
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:48,600
Then check what was again, check went to the job hunting and check that, okay, those three

52
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
are not enough.

53
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,240
You need to, most of the jobs are requiring frameworks.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,480
So let's go and learn frameworks.

55
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,900
And it was like a deep hole of frameworks, like a lot of them.

56
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,720
And I went with the most popular one at that time, which was React.

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,920
And well, there was the typing with TypeScript, and also there was the state management with

58
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,080
Redux, and some other tools with CSS.

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
So I learned plenty.

60
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,800
At the end of the year, it was 2018, at the end of 2018, I start to feel the pressure

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,520
like, okay, okay, it's enough with learning.

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,840
You really need to land the job.

63
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,720
You cannot just continue doing that.

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,400
And yeah, I started sending application at the end of that time.

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,280
That's when I really found myself like, this is the most difficult part.

66
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:51,640
And it's a company or a team trusting someone that just is entering the industry, that doesn't

67
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,320
have any professional experience, and it was very difficult.

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:03,280
I sent hundreds of applications, a lot of gusting, no answer, nothing, no feedback.

69
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,360
And that's difficult for you to improve yourself when you don't have any feedback, as you think

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
what you're doing wrong.

71
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,200
A good thing is that there are many groups out there, so you get to see many stories

72
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,560
like yours.

73
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,480
You get to know what you did wrong, and just perseverance, just keep applying, keep applying,

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:29,240
keep improving over what you have done before, improving your CV, your resume.

75
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,400
And I think there was like two or three, I think three interviews before I landed the

76
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,680
first job, fortunately.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,240
And in the same, in the three interviews, I was able to learn what I did wrong.

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,240
I knew that even if you reach the last step of the interview process, because you are

79
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
starting and you don't have a professional career, that's going to impact you.

80
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,040
And if there is someone that doesn't know, doesn't have the skills that you have, but

81
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,880
he has a professional experience, they are going to go with that one.

82
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,360
So I thought to myself like, what can you do to overcome that?

83
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:16,240
And then I started with open source contributions, I started with Mozilla, and there is plenty

84
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:25,400
of repos, plenty of projects where you can contribute there, there's also a small anecdote

85
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
about that.

86
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
We'll talk about that later on.

87
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:38,200
And then when I got the IO or Adblock plus interviews, when I sent my application, they

88
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
sent me back.

89
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,240
And when I received the first answer, I was like, okay, I need to impress them in one

90
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,440
way, I need to highlight myself.

91
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,320
So what I did was find out was, fortunately, they offer all this information to the public.

92
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,760
So I was able to find out what was the team that I was going to work on.

93
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,960
What was the project that I was going to, meant to work?

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,520
And it was in GitLab, and it's still in GitLab, with a mirror in GitHub.

95
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,400
And I started to check and like, okay, I have one week, I need to learn the basics of how

96
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,440
to go through the code base, get a little bit of phone overview.

97
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,920
Then after the week, I got the first assessment, and while I was doing the thing, that was

98
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
very short.

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:31,880
I think it took me three hours, four hours the most, it's a small webpage that I needed

100
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,740
to do.

101
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,960
And I also in parallel, I was already trying to make a contribution, was like a goal for

102
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
me.

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,080
Like before I get the technical interview, I need to make a contribution to them, like

104
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,480
a merge request or pull request.

105
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,480
And I need to have it landed.

106
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:56,440
And yeah, I was able to finish the merge request, and it wasn't approved at that time, because

107
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,840
there was another priorities, but at least they were able to see it.

108
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,920
They were able to see my skills, yeah.

109
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,960
And then it was like, okay, I'm going to have the merge request, sorry, the interview, I

110
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
need for another one.

111
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,360
I mean, I shouldn't stop here.

112
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:21,360
I don't have any, I couldn't leave anything to, yeah, I could be more than prepared for

113
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
all this.

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,160
So I ended up making two more merge requests, and the interview also, when they asked me

115
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,720
about some stuff, I also made reference for the merge request, like, okay, I did this

116
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,200
and I did that.

117
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,400
I didn't limit myself to only have this back finish.

118
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:46,000
I also tried to consider different scenarios, different cases for the user, and that helped.

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,080
Now that I'm working with them, and I'm part of the team, and I have seen also other process

120
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,920
of the hiring, I know that it was very difficult to trust someone that was just starting and

121
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
was changing career, and it was like one year and a half.

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,840
So it was a difficult decision, and I understand other companies that also don't trust that

123
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
much them.

124
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,800
I don't think it's ideal, but I understand the reasons.

125
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,840
And yeah, at the end, through all the process, they gave me an opportunity.

126
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,840
And after three years already, I just completed the three years, I'm still working with them.

127
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,780
Very happy, they were all the time very supportive.

128
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:37,680
They understood that I was just starting, very patient, and yeah, that's more of it.

129
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,680
That's great.

130
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,120
There's a lot of gems and some really good information and guidance in there.

131
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,240
Kudos on how you've approached this whole process.

132
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,320
I think it was very, very mature and very well thought through.

133
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,600
I think a lot of people can learn a lot from that.

134
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,400
I was going to ask the question about the interview process probably later on, but seeing

135
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,680
that you've touched on this already, maybe we can dig into it a little bit now.

136
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,960
I think you've made some really good points.

137
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:14,640
I've previously spoken with somebody called Ian Douglas, he's a career coach, and he also

138
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,840
gave a lot of good information about what a recruit is looking for.

139
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,960
And I think it's very important to understand that, because if you understand that, you

140
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:31,480
can tailor the way you approach applying for jobs better, because even though you did mention

141
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,520
that you sent out a lot of resumes to a lot of different companies, I think that is one

142
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
way of doing it.

143
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,520
But the other way of doing it is trying to find, let me stay back a little bit.

144
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:50,040
So there's a lot of opportunity right now in the software industry, whether that be

145
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,040
web development or machine learning or AI or any of these things, blockchain, there's

146
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,160
a lot of demand and there's a shortage of skills.

147
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,480
So it's kind of a really good time to get into this industry if it's something you're

148
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,480
interested in.

149
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,440
I think that's something to be highlighted.

150
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,640
Don't just get into tech because you think it's going to be some utopia that you're

151
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
entering.

152
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,440
You need to have a true interest and the love for problem solving and struggling and writing

153
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:26,320
code and trying to fix problems, failing, trying again, failing, trying again.

154
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,160
But then when it comes down to applying, I think you can be a little picky now.

155
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:38,320
You can kind of look for companies that interest you, the work they do, the culture they have,

156
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,040
that kind of thing, and then really tailor your resume to the company.

157
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,880
And I think all that research you did about who is AdBlock and what do they do and oh

158
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
yes, they're good.

159
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
Oh wow, it's open source.

160
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,880
I can actually contribute to this, actually contributing to work that they're doing.

161
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,240
I think that was a brilliant move on your part.

162
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,080
So I think that was the good experience that you had at the tail end.

163
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,040
But is there some things earlier on that you found?

164
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,180
I think you mentioned some of this where you felt ghosted sometimes and you didn't get

165
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:23,040
feedback from the recruiters about why you weren't even given an interview or something

166
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
like that.

167
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,760
Is there anything, any other things you'd like to bring up that you found during the

168
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,960
interview process that you felt was not ideal or even completely broken?

169
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,040
And do you have any ideas about how recruiters and companies can improve that?

170
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Yeah.

171
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,200
So before we reach that question, I wanted to make a comment about what you just mentioned

172
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:51,920
about tailoring the, but you are partially right about tailoring the interaction with

173
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,440
the company that you are interviewing with.

174
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:03,520
What I'm not that in favor, and it's because we are not considering completely the experience

175
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,800
that a early stage developer has, it's about tailoring the resume.

176
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
Because I have heard also multiple times like, hey, you should send a specific resume to

177
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,120
every one of the companies, just remove everything that is not meant for the company, just focus

178
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
on that one.

179
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,800
The problem is that, I mean, the people that have go through standard academic learning

180
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,560
stuff, universities or this kind of engineer schools, or the ones that have finished like

181
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,880
a bootcamp, that kind of thing, they have very little to add in their resume.

182
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,800
Most of them is like small projects that everyone did, and they tried to add it like that in

183
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
their resume.

184
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,840
I also did that.

185
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,880
And so there is not much to remove from the resume, unfortunately.

186
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,080
And yeah, the companies are going just to ignore it because it's the same everywhere.

187
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,400
It's a very, I mean, if you focus on what the company wants, it's very little what they

188
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,120
can get from that.

189
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,520
That's also something that I noticed that when I started, they were like, hey, I have

190
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,800
this skill, I can do this and I can do that.

191
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,320
But I wasn't in the mindset like what the company wants from me, what can I do for the

192
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
company?

193
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,200
And I have noticed that mindset in many people that are finishing their careers, that they

194
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,600
are like, hey, I'm good at this and I'm good at that.

195
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,360
But they don't go and say, I can help you team with this, I can do this for this.

196
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,560
I have noticed that this company does this, I can do this for you.

197
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
And we need to change that.

198
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,400
It's not mentioned that much out there, unfortunately, but that's something that recruiters really

199
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,920
appreciate.

200
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,600
Things that I learned about, well, there are bad and good things.

201
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,320
One, for example, there's a lot of stuff.

202
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,520
There is one that there is a lot of opportunities out there that are coming out, popping up,

203
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,120
but they are specific to certain groups, which is very nice.

204
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,360
But you cannot cover all the groups.

205
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:15,880
In my case, I was established in Mexico and didn't have many opportunities, especially

206
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
for remote jobs.

207
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,280
I was trying to target European or USA market.

208
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,880
It was just very difficult, almost impossible.

209
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:32,320
And there was some initiatives, I think one of them was, there was one that approached

210
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,800
for Mozilla and it's quite popular.

211
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,200
I think you mentioned in one of the podcasts for outreach, that one.

212
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,760
So I get to hear about that and I applied to that one.

213
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,680
And unfortunately, I got rejected, but that didn't stop me.

214
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,660
I was like, okay, this is the nice thing about working in the open.

215
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,160
They publish everything, all the candidates, which companies were accepting them.

216
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,600
You were like, okay, and even more, which team was going to work with these people that

217
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,860
were selected?

218
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,000
So I was like, okay, what I can get from this is that these teams and these companies are

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,860
open to help out early career developers to grow.

220
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,560
So I target Mozilla and I noticed like, okay, this team, which was a very internal tools

221
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,800
team, I did some contribution, I think over a dozen contributions there.

222
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,680
I forgot already the name of the repo.

223
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:35,800
So they accepted one person in outreach and I was like, okay, I went to the repo, I checked

224
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,720
and the person was already helping out in the process.

225
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,520
I mean, this person had access to all the internal communication.

226
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,680
I didn't, it was only the GitHub.

227
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,320
But I started also, along with this person, even if I wasn't going to receive the compensation,

228
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,320
the support, I was like, I'm going through the experience at least.

229
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,520
And I started with a person at the same time and we were like contributing, both of us

230
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,760
were contributing following the process, the difference is that the other person was internal

231
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,200
communication and compensation.

232
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,960
But then it was super nice because one of the administrators of the repo sent me an

233
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:18,800
invitation for, at that time, IRC, I don't remember which server, but IRC channel.

234
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,400
And I was able to like, able to store the local chat and the chatting locally, like

235
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
keep it persistent.

236
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,680
So I was able to communicate with them and I got to learn a lot.

237
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,880
It was a React project, if I remember correctly.

238
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,680
And I was with them, I think three months, something like that, the full experience and

239
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,880
all the other stuff, I ended up adding into the resume.

240
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,200
I wasn't outreach, I didn't mention any outreach stuff, but the contribution I was able to.

241
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,360
So that's one of the things that I try to recommend to the people out there is that

242
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,440
yes, compensations are important, but even if you are not able, if you are not selected,

243
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,960
you need to make the most out of it and try to take the opportunity, at least learning

244
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,680
for other people that are out there.

245
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,120
And all this, do this, all this kind of research.

246
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,960
So that's one of the things that I did.

247
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:29,280
Good things that the people that interviewers check and it's self-learning, they have initiative.

248
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,960
Depending on the company, I was lucky with the open source.

249
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,240
If you mentioned this, because the recruiters are going like give a fast overview.

250
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,920
So if you have made contributions to open source, be clear to put those ones at the

251
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,120
top and mention the big companies like Mozilla, mentioning that, even if you did like a small

252
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,720
contribution, you can talk later on about that with them.

253
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,160
Make it short.

254
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
Some people make like three pages of resume.

255
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,440
They don't have times, recruiters to check all of that.

256
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,840
So make it short, one page, very, very small, all this kind of stuff.

257
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,200
For example, if the tails, like the URLs, and if you can just add the link into the

258
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,480
PDF, that would be nice instead of putting the full stuff.

259
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,800
Team skills, soft skills, they look for that.

260
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Don't try to present yourself like a very smart person.

261
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Be humble.

262
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
There is always someone that has more knowledge out there than you.

263
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,600
And a lot of people have more knowledge than you.

264
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:37,200
And I think that, me as a starter, when I started the job, I think that was the skill

265
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,800
that they appreciate the most.

266
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,680
And it was like, I really wanted to learn.

267
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,080
I was like, hey, because they emphasize on that, like, what do you think?

268
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Do you know?

269
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
How much do you know?

270
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,160
And I was like, I know, but I know all of, I see all of you and you have a lot of knowledge

271
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:03,040
and I will be very happy to get a little bit of that knowledge to help out the team.

272
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,280
So it's all about the team.

273
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
It's not about you.

274
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,560
It's about the team, making the team better.

275
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,400
You become better and the team and some becoming better also.

276
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
So yeah.

277
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Yeah, no, I agree.

278
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,000
I think it is important to talk about what value would you add to the team as an individual.

279
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,880
Not so much just what you can do technically, but the soft skills.

280
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,960
I think that's very important.

281
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,840
I think that's one of the things that you get from open source is you get to show that

282
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,520
you're able to work in a team.

283
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,120
You're able to follow guidance, you're able to take feedback constructively, you know,

284
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,480
you don't like rage quit and like close the pull request kind of thing.

285
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,560
If somebody disagreed with something that you said, and I think sometimes also what

286
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:57,520
shows a lot of your character is if maybe you opened a pull request and the people from

287
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,600
the repository or the project came back and they said, ah, you know what, this is not

288
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,760
really something we want to do at this point.

289
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,520
So unfortunately we're going to close this pull request, but thanks so much.

290
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,960
And there are some other ways, other things you can contribute on and they point you towards

291
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,520
it and people can see that you actually went and took something else and took that, opened

292
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,800
that one and got that merged.

293
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,040
I think that shows a lot of character that you're able to take feedback, not take it

294
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:28,920
personally and they move on and take the guidance and find the things that the company actually

295
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:35,560
or the project actually feels is useful contributions or valuable contributions, I should say.

296
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,040
And that you are able to do that, that you're not just saying, oh, no, this is a bad experience.

297
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,920
I feel like, oh, I can't deal with this and I'm going to move on because part of work

298
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,520
is getting feedback.

299
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,680
All or most companies these days works through some kind of pull request flow.

300
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:04,640
So your code is going to be reviewed by peers and there are going to be people who have

301
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,600
more knowledge on a specific topic than you and might be able to help you by telling you,

302
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,920
oh, you know what, there's a better way to do this or wow, this component is getting

303
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
really big.

304
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,600
I think you should split it up into three separate components that each just do one

305
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,080
thing really well.

306
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,180
And I think being able to take that kind of guidance and acknowledge it and not just give

307
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,320
up because people give them just say, yeah, this is perfect and most full request, I think

308
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
that shows a lot.

309
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,240
So going through that process, I think is important.

310
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,800
So I'm wondering, you have a lot of enthusiasm and you have a lot of, what is the word I'm

311
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
looking for?

312
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,960
You don't give up easily.

313
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,760
I think that that is something that I've learned about you in this short while that we've been

314
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
talking so far.

315
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,880
And I think that's also important.

316
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Don't give up.

317
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,640
If this is really something you want, you have to keep going.

318
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,800
You have to roll with the punches as they say, sometimes things aren't going to quite

319
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,120
go your way, but see what you can take from the experience and learn to use somewhere

320
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
else.

321
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Maybe this wasn't the right company or the right like outreach.

322
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,040
Maybe that wasn't the right vehicle for you.

323
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,240
Maybe you need to find something else.

324
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,320
I think it is hard.

325
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
It is hard.

326
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:30,200
I mean, it's human nature that if you keep putting yourself out there and you feel like

327
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,920
you keep getting rejected, you do lose motivation.

328
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,280
You do start to think, is it me?

329
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,000
It's not the industry.

330
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's not the company.

331
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's not the project.

332
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's me.

333
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's something wrong with me.

334
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
So I wonder, what do you do?

335
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:53,480
Is there some like, I don't know, resources, books, people, anything like that, that makes

336
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,320
you able to be so persistent and to be so resilient?

337
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:04,240
Well, about the resilience per se, it's difficult to give an advice on that.

338
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,000
It's just simple to say like, don't give up.

339
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,440
I felt a little bit down when I was rejected, but not a little bit, a lot, but you get used

340
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
to it.

341
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,760
I mean, you just keep trying and then it's like normal.

342
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:26,480
Obviously, you need to learn from that, but try to improve yourself.

343
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,920
I think what made me, I didn't have like this kind of network.

344
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,880
Still, many people were recommending like, hey, make a network in the social places and

345
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,840
you will get a lot of people out there and you will end up landing a job.

346
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,520
I'm not good at that, unfortunately.

347
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,120
What I found out was that it was very nice to have these communities of people.

348
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,480
There's a lot of people from different countries that are trying to do exactly the same.

349
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
They see the opportunity.

350
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,120
There's a lot of benefits from that.

351
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,400
And they really want to just get the first job.

352
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,560
And that's what helped me out to keep going.

353
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,760
There is a place that later on, well, I can recommend already, but there are multiple

354
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
places like that.

355
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,160
I mean, you have the network that you started this year, the Miscellaneous Network, that's

356
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
very nice.

357
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:26,440
There is another one that at that time I got to know and it has plenty of followers, Chingu,

358
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,320
the Chingu Project.

359
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:38,680
The nice thing about that place is that they simulate like kind of teamwork with kind of

360
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,800
an agile thing.

361
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
And that helps out.

362
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,560
Like, you need to establish your goals, what you want to finish.

363
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,280
You have a team of a designer, developer, project manager, all that kind of stuff.

364
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,440
And it's for free.

365
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,280
All that is for free.

366
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,560
I think I learned from free.

367
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,920
They didn't have that much money, so I was like, yeah, I cannot afford just investing

368
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
at that time.

369
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,800
And I use sense for the rest.

370
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
There is a lot of free resources.

371
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
That's the nice thing.

372
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,000
So I think the support from the people that was helped the most, like seeing, talking

373
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,200
to each other like, hey, I had this interview when it didn't go that well, let's keep going.

374
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,160
And complaining to each other like, hey, why are they not giving opportunity to people

375
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
like us?

376
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Because the companies are saying that there is not enough developers out there.

377
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,720
So all that kind of stuff gives you a little bit of confidence.

378
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
And you just keep trying.

379
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Find a way.

380
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,400
Like you say, don't give up.

381
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Find your way.

382
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,520
Each person has a way to learn and achieve their goals.

383
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,160
Just feel comfortable at that.

384
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,640
Now, places to learn.

385
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,400
I don't remember what was the first one, but for certain, the one that I used the most

386
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,120
in the first years of the learning process was MDN.

387
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
There was a quite well structure.

388
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,520
I mean, I went through at that time through the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript handbook guides

389
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,440
and stuff.

390
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,840
I think something nice about those guides and compared to another ones is that they

391
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,920
really care for accessibility, for example.

392
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:23,320
They really care about using the things right, using the proper elements, not just fill everything

393
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,240
with deep containers or span containers.

394
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,520
They were really emphasizing about making things in a proper way.

395
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,960
And that, because I learned it in a very early stage of my career, that stick with me.

396
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,800
And I'm still doing it in the job.

397
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,400
I'm like always trying to emphasize whatever I develop or whatever I review, I dedicate

398
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,720
more time to check all those kinds of stuff, accessibility, one of them.

399
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:59,920
So MDN, I still do it, use it a lot, especially for checking APIs, if I'm doing it right,

400
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,160
if it's one argument or two arguments, the number of stuff that this requires.

401
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,720
Another one that I recommend, and I think it's not that popular, a little bit of a pity,

402
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,160
is JavaScript info, JavaScript.info, it's for JavaScript only, it's quite well structured.

403
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,600
And I like it a lot.

404
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,480
I don't use it that much nowadays, but for learning, it's pretty good.

405
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,160
And well, in general, just any search engine, whatever doubts you have, whatever problem

406
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,000
you have, just search there, just keep an eye on the dates and whatever they recommend,

407
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,520
if it's up to date, the browser compatibility, the version, if maybe you can use a better

408
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,680
API or a different CSS rule thingish, whatever.

409
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,320
So just keep an eye on the dates.

410
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,040
This thing changes quite often.

411
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,860
So yeah, I know JavaScript.info has been mentioned by a couple of folks actually.

412
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,120
So it's interesting that there isn't more focus on that.

413
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,240
I hadn't looked at it.

414
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,080
I kind of knew about it, but I haven't really looked at it.

415
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,920
And having so many people mention it, I did have a look at it and it is really good.

416
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,880
It is really, really good.

417
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,560
I would definitely encourage a lot of people to check it out, especially if you're early

418
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,740
on still learning, think it's a good resource.

419
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:25,680
So I think you've highlighted some of the resources that again, like I mentioned, I've

420
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:32,440
heard a lot of other people mention, and I think MDN is the guidebook for the web.

421
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,800
That is the intent.

422
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
That's what it's meant for.

423
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
It's why it's around.

424
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,080
It's why it's so popular.

425
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,360
But I do think that I've learned, and I want to hear your side of this, and I don't want

426
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:53,560
to talk about it too much from my side, but I've heard a lot of feedback regarding gaps

427
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,860
with the learning experience.

428
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,760
So without leading you down a specific road, I'm just going to kind of put it at that.

429
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,400
What struggles have you had when you learned, like, yeah, there's these great resources

430
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,800
out there like MDN and JavaScript Info, but what are the challenges that you faced when

431
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
learning?

432
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:22,520
So divided by my parts in my career is starting, it was like finding the resources that I need

433
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
to learn.

434
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,560
That wasn't that difficult.

435
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,480
I think the first struggle was like what to do after, because you get like these basics

436
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,560
and then you get yourself with a lot of frameworks and like, which one am I going to learn?

437
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,640
Because I really considered at that time, I didn't know how many were out there.

438
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,040
And I was like, I'm going to learn all of them.

439
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:48,720
And then later on you find out, and every year or even short of the time, one pops out.

440
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,560
So no, you are not going to.

441
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,440
You need to focus on something and work on that.

442
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,960
And later on you can improve or learn something else, but you need to make your choices.

443
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:12,280
There is a lot of places, either YouTube, either communities, even companies that provide

444
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:18,160
this kind of learning paths by you need to pay a little bit.

445
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,720
There's a lot of demand at the moment, a lot of products and business out there doing this

446
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,000
because of the demand problem.

447
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:38,560
And what I see on all of them is that they try to make you learn either a frame or something

448
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:46,000
super fast, but they are lacking the professional experience, the real practice.

449
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,080
You end up being able to replicate, for example, an example, a project example, either a website

450
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,640
or either an app.

451
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:02,080
You can replicate, you do it exactly the same as it was done there, but you don't have initiative.

452
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,680
Not all the time it's about creating something from scratch.

453
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,480
Most of the time it's about giving maintenance to something that has already been done.

454
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,120
And that's rarely touched.

455
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,500
You don't see that much of a stuff.

456
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,160
So it will be nice to take these people.

457
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:21,920
I mean, I'm in love with open source stuff, with open source project.

458
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,200
There is a lot of them.

459
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,760
It's getting more and more popular out there.

460
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:31,640
Just take these people that are coming out of any learning process and help them out

461
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,720
to contribute, to get experience there.

462
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,440
Both are going to be a win-win.

463
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,280
The people that are behind the project are going to either improve their documentation,

464
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,880
for example, to facilitate the contribution or even better, maybe a mesh request, something

465
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,800
fixed, maybe in the future, who knows?

466
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,920
Also, they will be able to see the people that are coming out from this learning process

467
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:01,800
and consider them, having consideration about picking up some of them to a future opportunity.

468
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:09,320
And also, all of us gets to learn how it is to work in a team and how it is to work not

469
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:16,000
just in a team, also in real cases scenario, fixing stuff, giving maintenance.

470
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,840
So that's the initial stuff.

471
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,240
Then it comes ghosting with the interviews.

472
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,960
I don't see the solution there.

473
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:31,360
The only thing, there was a case that is still in my mind, and I think it's quite a bad practice.

474
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:39,960
There was a company that wanted to help, or maybe have a little bit of popularity, want

475
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,560
to help the beginners out there.

476
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:50,840
So this company made a post and a social network, and I said like, hey, we have a vacancy, we

477
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,320
have an opportunity.

478
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,400
I think it was only one for early development, people with zero experience.

479
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,600
No, the post got super popular.

480
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,040
And the thing is that I apply, and a lot of people apply also, later on I got to know

481
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,800
them, if I remember correctly, they say that they had over 1,000 applicants.

482
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,240
So they were struggling a lot to process all of them.

483
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,160
So it just not made difficult for them, but also for us, because it was complete ghosting.

484
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,320
Like you didn't get any information.

485
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,600
You got the interviews, they went through the interviews of many people, of hundreds

486
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
of people.

487
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Interviews of hundreds.

488
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
That's so difficult.

489
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,000
It was super fast.

490
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,280
They told me, like, we are interviewing these hundreds of people, and they were like, oh

491
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,960
my God, five, 10 minutes, very fast, and obviously they are going to forget about you.

492
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,960
I don't know how they ended up with the selection, and yeah, this is one of them.

493
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,760
I think not us, candidates should focus on the companies that want to work, but also

494
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,240
the companies that are trying to select the people, they also should put a little bit

495
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
more of dedication.

496
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,480
Difficult, I know, but just give a little bit of feedback.

497
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:17,520
In the case of us in AdBlock Plus, I have also been nowadays with interaction with some

498
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,720
hiring process, and I have noticed that a candidate is requested, but they want to learn

499
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
about that.

500
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,840
It's not just getting the job, it's I want something out of this, and we try to push

501
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,600
for that, we provide, like, hey, we like this from you, and we think that you can improve

502
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,880
this, this other thing.

503
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,880
So that's the second thing that I struggled, which was gusting and being able to learn,

504
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,500
work on while being blind on the part.

505
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,560
Then it comes a lot of stuff, then it comes the first months in the job, I think it's

506
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,760
something that is good to know, because most of us will struggle with that, and most of

507
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
us won't be able.

508
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:05,600
I have, unfortunately, I have seen cases where after all this hard work and stress, they

509
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,760
get their jobs, and they find out that the job is even more stressful than anything else,

510
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,920
and they either quit or they are not able to keep the job after weeks or maybe months,

511
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,880
and that's a little bit disappointing, because that's going to break a lot of people out

512
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,800
there, and it's quite bad.

513
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:33,080
So that's something that you need to be prepared, and it's the imposter syndrome, which is quite

514
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:39,040
mentioned out there, and it's that you will feel like you are there just by luck, that

515
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,080
they made a mistake choosing you, that, yeah, I still also feel it.

516
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,480
You get used to it.

517
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,840
It's just, in my case, it's like, if I feel that, it's because I still have something

518
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,720
to learn, and that's exciting.

519
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:00,400
So I went through that the first six months, and the fear, they are going to fire me, and

520
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,880
they will notice that I'm not the person that they were looking for, and instead of being

521
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,520
able to focus to do your job, instead of being able to focus to learn from the other people,

522
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,840
you were focused to not get fired, and I'm telling you, my team was amazing.

523
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,520
They were like, all the time, we are not expecting you to walk this fast, we are not expecting

524
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:27,560
all, we are expecting only for you to learn, to learn from the team.

525
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,840
They clearly say, take your time.

526
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
That was amazing.

527
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,400
Yeah, but it's still in me, like, no, no, no, I need to still finish stuff, and maybe

528
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,880
they say that because they wanted to be kind, but yeah.

529
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,080
And how did I overcame that?

530
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:50,760
Well, like you said, just not give up, just be persistent, just try to, well, now what

531
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:58,920
I feel is like, all the people that have a lot of knowledge, try to interact with them.

532
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,680
The nice thing about this career, in general, development, is that most of the people are

533
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,980
very, very kind.

534
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,440
Most of the people want to teach others, and they are willing to explain, dedicate the

535
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,080
time to explain how things work.

536
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,120
So just go there as for help, get feedback from everyone.

537
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,160
And when you have the opportunity to share stuff, express it.

538
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,480
If the people, even if what you say is redundant with something else, or it doesn't make sense,

539
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,080
express it, because it will help you out to improve in communication with something else

540
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
that you need to learn.

541
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,880
See, they've been able to communicate with the team.

542
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,320
And well, yeah, two things could happen.

543
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,680
In my company, it's like they were super nice, hearing me out.

544
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
That's nice.

545
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,280
And it could be that other people in other companies, they won't be that nice.

546
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,000
And if that's the case, then maybe it's not the place for you.

547
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,120
I struggle.

548
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,360
And I think that was the thing that hit the most, because it stayed there for a long time.

549
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,160
I think one year and a half, two years, like super stressed because of that.

550
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:13,200
Then after time, you get to know like, okay, first idea to my money, like I love this job,

551
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,040
the company's being that nice to me, but jobs are not forever.

552
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,160
So you need to start focusing in things that will be more persistent in your lifetime,

553
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,720
giving more priorities in your life.

554
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,800
That is when the things get a little bit relaxed.

555
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,800
And I mean, I'm still worried sometimes, but you get to relax.

556
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,760
You have your times for relax.

557
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,440
And nowadays, what I focus the most on, the challenge, one of the challenges is that I

558
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,680
want to be more productive.

559
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:49,440
I feel like, and I am slower than most of my peers or my developers.

560
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,080
And we just had a discussion about what could be the reasons of that.

561
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,840
It's not like they requested for me, like they didn't say that, but I felt that.

562
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,800
And it's all about how you focus on stuff.

563
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,440
It's all about how you prioritize things.

564
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,400
Sometimes you go too deep on something and you need to go a little bit wide.

565
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,700
You need to have this kind of, later on I got to learn that you need to have this kind

566
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,640
of time budget, that you don't have time for everything.

567
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,840
If you had it initially for, you don't have time to learn everything from all the frameworks,

568
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:26,380
now you don't have time for being able to go that deep into the code base, into an issue.

569
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,760
Maybe you want the best solution, but considering the time.

570
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,120
So yes, all these kinds of things you get to learn.

571
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,360
And right now I'm working on that.

572
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:43,600
I have felt improvement over the last weeks, but still I think there is a margin to learn

573
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
things to learn from that.

574
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,280
Yeah, that's a tricky one.

575
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,040
It's something I still struggle with.

576
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,840
I have tried so many tools and methodologies and stuff like that.

577
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,040
This week, for example, the one I've heard about before and I haven't implemented it,

578
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,440
which is the key part of it.

579
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,280
Just reading about a productivity method doesn't make it happen.

580
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,600
You actually have to implement it for it to work.

581
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,040
So I've heard about the Eisenhower method, which is something I'm curious about explaining.

582
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,960
And then I learned about this new one called the Moscow method.

583
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:23,800
It's actually, it spells Moscow, but it's, it's actually an acronym.

584
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,920
It's basically, what does it stand for?

585
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,320
Let me see if I can see, derived from the letter of each.

586
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:36,080
So M is must have, S is should have, C is could have, and W is won't have.

587
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,440
And then if you make it into an acronym, it's Moscow.

588
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,520
So it's very similar to the Eisenhower technique, but I guess it has subtle differences.

589
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,080
So I'm kind of reading about that one as well.

590
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,720
I've tried different tools to try and like give myself artificial deadlines and stuff

591
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,360
like this, because I feel if I don't have a deadline, I'm always going to like just

592
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,240
keep procrastinating on the thing.

593
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,320
I'm going to keep diving into that deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole.

594
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,560
And so I'm going to overthink stuff.

595
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,080
Like I'll look at a single element and like, is this really the right element?

596
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,400
And like, while that's important, sometimes you have to like, say, you know, it's, it's

597
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
good enough for now.

598
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Let's move on.

599
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,720
We can put a little to-do note in there and we can come back and revisit it.

600
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,720
So yeah, I totally get that and I agree.

601
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,760
So we're kind of running out of time and there's two things, two or three things I'd like to

602
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,760
touch on.

603
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:35,680
So I'd say as much as you can or want to about this, but you mentioned earlier on that being

604
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,840
from Mexico, you were targeting US and European countries, but you found it almost impossible.

605
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:47,880
I think there's a lot of people in developing countries that faces the same problem where

606
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,120
in their own country, jobs are very scarce.

607
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,680
So they do want to reach out to the bigger global market.

608
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,960
But especially when you're new, how do you even do that?

609
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,440
Can you like, just dive into that a little bit?

610
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,160
Like what were the challenges that you were facing and do you have any like ideas of what

611
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
we can do?

612
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,920
Is this a community thing that can help you?

613
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,400
Can open source help you?

614
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,760
Yeah, same goes with open source.

615
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,720
I think, well, first I noticed that with USA was going to be a little bit more difficult.

616
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,520
I got, I think one interview only.

617
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,200
It was quite informal, it was usually the smaller the company, the more opportunities

618
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,280
they give because the bigger they get, the more they need to follow like this kind of

619
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,000
standards to not overcomplicate themselves with special cases of people outside of their

620
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
countries.

621
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
So I noticed that.

622
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,120
So yeah, there was a couple of opportunities in USA, but it was like a company that was

623
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,120
going just to start.

624
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,800
And then I still didn't get those.

625
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,160
What I noticed is that Europe in general give more opportunity to people from outside of

626
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,480
the area, at least from Mexico.

627
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,360
I'm not certain of all the regions.

628
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,080
I'm not certain about India, for example.

629
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,800
I'm not certain about some African countries.

630
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,680
I'm not certain about that, but at least from Mexico, I got to see that they were quite

631
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,680
open to that.

632
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,880
So it looks like they are not that strict with this process about this kind of payment.

633
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,920
There is the freelance opportunity, it's your part of a company.

634
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:29,080
You don't have all the benefits in a way of people that is on sites, like for example,

635
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,220
health, insurance, all that kind of stuff, but they can still hire you as a freelancer

636
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,960
and there's plenty of methods out there for payment.

637
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,660
So it's about most of the policies that they follow.

638
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,720
And yeah, in Europe, I found more opportunities and I got most of the interviews from there

639
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:53,680
and where my company is from Germany, so yeah, it matches all what I saw before.

640
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,960
And well, open source, it's like if you see that a company has plenty of projects that

641
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:07,320
are out there, it means that they are open to or there will be more flexibility for people

642
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:16,440
from outside of the company to get enrolled into the processes.

643
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,920
They will be, again, they will be more open maybe to hire someone, maybe to share some

644
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
stuff.

645
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,460
They care for another, maybe for results, for the user experience, for the products,

646
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:32,520
but not instead for like, only these people get to know about the process of the company.

647
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,400
So it's working on the pop and if you search for a company that works in the open, that

648
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,680
will give you more opportunities for you to get hired, personal experience.

649
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,680
Yeah, that's good.

650
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,680
That's good to know.

651
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
Yeah.

652
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,560
It's interesting that Europe is more open.

653
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,560
Cool.

654
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,560
So two things I want to touch on.

655
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,240
I saw, I had a look at your GitHub and you've got quite a lot of stuff going on there, but

656
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,880
there were two projects that kind of jumped out at me, but I don't know if you want to

657
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,880
quickly touch on them.

658
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,880
Again, I didn't look into them in detail, so I don't know how active you are still

659
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,120
with these, but they just sounded interesting.

660
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:06,600
The one is called Meet Your Lab and the other one is called Failed Coding Exercises.

661
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,120
Well, the Failed Coding Exercises, I don't remember.

662
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,560
First of all, I'm not active on GitHub, unfortunately.

663
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,440
That's something that, as I'm struggling, that I'm trying to find the time for my side

664
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,440
projects.

665
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,480
There is a lot of side projects accumulated in the list.

666
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,160
You mentioned before about the improvement stuff, about how we can get more productive.

667
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,920
We have this stuff as developers is that, okay, we are thinking how to improve on something

668
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,520
and we are already thinking about implementing something like, oh, I can create this application.

669
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,120
We are tempted to create this stuff, even if it's out there already.

670
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,640
So there is a big list to do.

671
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:53,280
So now that GitHub, I'm trying to find a way to have time for me, not only the company

672
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,280
stuff.

673
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,560
Little by little, I'm getting better at that, but still I haven't reached the time to dedicate

674
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,560
for my side projects.

675
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,120
So the failing exercise, I don't even remember what it was.

676
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,480
Another thing is GitHub is not the report where I work most nowadays.

677
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,240
We work in GitLab, so we have moved to GitLab and I don't have mirrors, unfortunately, for

678
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,640
my projects.

679
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:24,200
So Met Your Live was about a project for Chingo, was one of the projects that we did there.

680
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:31,120
It was React, TypeScript and Redux and I listed in the CV, but at the end, I think the open

681
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:37,200
source contributions to Mozilla was what interested most to recruiters because it's this team

682
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,680
working stuff.

683
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,800
Also, but Chingo Interaction also helped, they asked me about that.

684
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:49,280
There was another one, TabFX, which was an extension that I did a request from one of

685
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,000
the interactions with MDN administrators, developers.

686
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,120
We have the chat and the person said, it would be nice if we have this extension.

687
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,880
And I was like, I can do that.

688
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,360
And I said myself like, in one week, let's do this.

689
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,360
And I was able to do it.

690
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,720
The person used it and I improved it.

691
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,180
I dedicate probably three months, four months of my attendance.

692
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,520
I got only like 50 people using it the most now at ICC STEER team.

693
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,240
Then I got the job and I wasn't able to keep working on that.

694
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Interesting.

695
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
Yeah, no, it's hard.

696
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,920
And I think we shouldn't break our backs to try and do side projects.

697
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,800
But I think if it's an outlet for your own creativity, then it's great.

698
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,640
But I don't think if you're already busy enough with work and you get all the satisfaction

699
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:44,920
and you get to explore new technologies and new things as part of your day job, then I

700
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,400
mean, you don't have to give yourself for that to do side projects.

701
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,720
Thanks so much again, folks, for joining.

702
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,520
I think this was a great conversation.

703
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,680
There's a lot of insights that you've shared that I really think is going to help a lot

704
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,840
of people.

705
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:04,080
So just in closing, is there anything you'd like to mention, any last words, any advice

706
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:09,800
that you'd like to give to early stage web developers and how can people find you on

707
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,800
the internet?

708
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,440
Yeah, Twitter, LinkedIn.

709
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,040
I think nowadays I'm more active in LinkedIn, but yeah, Twitter also.

710
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:26,960
I think you will share it in the notes, my handlers, and well, just for the companies

711
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:35,440
and the teams out there, I know that it's difficult to get developers, there is a lot

712
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,800
of demands and not that many with the skills that they want, but you need to dedicate a

713
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:50,320
little bit of time to create these kinds of opportunities for early stage developers to

714
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,720
interact with them and get to see the skills that you don't get in, I don't know, half

715
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,920
an hour, one hour interview, it's impossible to get them.

716
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,880
Most of the people like me are nervous half of the time in that interview.

717
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,400
It doesn't need to, I mean, I highly recommend open source projects and give them this space

718
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,520
for them to interact, but it doesn't need to be them.

719
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,600
They can be like workshops also, they can be like hackathons, open hackathons where

720
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,080
they can go there and it's mostly I think two weeks, three weeks that they can take

721
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:28,320
from their normal workflow and I think they will find plenty of people that it may end

722
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:35,960
up becoming part of their developers right away or maybe in one, two years they can keep

723
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,680
an eye on them and see their role and hire them later.

724
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,280
So yeah, have this space.

725
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,720
Yeah, that's good advice, that's good advice.

726
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,040
Thank you so much for joining me Adelson, this was a great, great chat.

727
