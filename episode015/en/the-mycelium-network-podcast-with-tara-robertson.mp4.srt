Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,560
Hey, Tara, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Thank you so much for joining me.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,560
Thank you for inviting me.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
I'm excited to be here.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,600
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,760
So I know you from the days at Mozilla when you used to work there, and I'm still there

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,440
to some extent, but you've moved on and started your own company.

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,440
And I know the work, I followed the work that you did at Mozilla, and I've been following

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,880
the work you've been doing with your own company.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,800
And I really appreciate and respect your input and the way you look at a lot of things.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,400
And I think this podcast is going to be a little different than some of the others I've

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,440
done, but it's intentionally so, because I think these are really important topics to

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,040
talk about.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,540
And for early-stage people, I think they need to understand that there's more to the tech

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,320
industry and more to a job than just writing code.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,280
How we work with each other and how we interact is as critical as the code we write.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:16,600
And oftentimes, an unwelcoming environment is going to lead to not great work.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,960
And so your code might actually end up suffering because the environment's not great.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,720
And I think I've also spoken to some women that has had it a little tough, especially

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:34,760
the one, Pamela, who came from Mexico, where being the only woman in the room was definitely

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,080
hard and definitely tough, and it did affect how comfortable she felt.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,160
And you don't voice your opinion in those situations, and that is a loss for the company

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,600
because we want diverse voices, because it makes our products better, it makes our everything

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
better.

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,800
And that's why I wanted to have a chat about this.

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,880
So but I don't want to ramble on.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,240
I want to give you the floor, and I want you to tell us about who you are.

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,560
And please take as much time as you want, go as far back as you want, and be as detailed

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,360
as you want.

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Thanks.

33
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,120
So my name is Tara Robertson.

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,280
I'm in Vancouver, Canada on the unceded traditional territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,080
Tsleil-Waututh First Nations.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,280
Making a land acknowledgement like this is fairly common in Canada, but I think if we're

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,760
going to talk about power and talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion, like the land that

38
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm on and the power dynamics just that exist in a colonial setting, they kind of inform

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
everything.

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,480
I also just think about the land that I'm on, and during the pandemic, the mountains,

41
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,520
the forest, the ocean, like, I've been able to really resource myself and my brain and

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,940
my heart and my spirit from the land.

43
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:02,440
So the land takes care of me, like literally, and we've got a responsibility to figure out

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,520
how we take care of the land as well.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:13,400
That was an attention I expected to go on but yeah, like, and if this is like kind of

46
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,880
the magic of the internet because where it's 11 a.m. where I'm at and it's nighttime where

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:25,720
you are, and we met at a certain time at Mozilla, and before we hopped on, we're just talking

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,760
about the fondness that we have for the people and the culture and the work there.

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,560
So I kind of love, like at Mozilla, we were finding to keep the internet open and accessible

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,960
for all, and right now we're connected through the internet, on the internet, to have this

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,120
conversation about culture and how we want to work together.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Yeah, yeah, it's amazing.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
So right now, as a consultant, I do two different things.

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,880
I do data-driven diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy work with companies and organizations

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,160
who want to have, like, an overall strategy so that they can really make this work part

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,400
of everything that they do from, like, the employee, the employee experience through

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,120
to the marketing team, through the products and services that a company is offering, as

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,920
well as stuff like procurement and where they're doing banking.

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,080
Like, for me, diversity, equity, and inclusion is a lens that we need to view everything

60
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,600
through, not just, like, how we write a job description and who we hire.

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:36,160
I love what you touched on about, like, people who think it's just about writing code, like,

62
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,880
but work happens, like, in a context, and just thinking about the problems that we have

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,200
right now, they're huge in the world, and the problems that we're trying to solve in

64
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,400
tech are really complex, wicked problems.

65
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,320
So we also need an environment where there's psychological safety, and people feel like

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,360
they can speak up either with, like, a wildly creative idea that might sound, like, just

67
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,840
way out there, and also speak up when they see something that's wrong.

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,720
And both of those things take a lot of courage.

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
They do.

70
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,400
So, like, there's the individual courage to speak up.

71
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,400
But there's also how the kind of culture that we build day after day together, where we

72
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,840
either build a culture where we can take risks and we're more likely to take those risks

73
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,560
together or not, where we keep our great ideas to ourselves, or when we see something that's

74
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,120
getting shipped, we're like, oh, is that going to break something?

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
I don't know.

76
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm just not going to say anything.

77
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Yeah.

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
We all lose out.

79
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Yeah, no, for sure.

80
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
For sure.

81
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,960
I mean, and this is something that a previous guest has touched on.

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,120
She talked about harassment in the workspace.

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,000
And in Mexico, the laws are a little fast and loose when it comes to that.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,880
And basically, she was talking to somebody, and they said, well, one of your options is

85
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,160
to go to the CEO and demand change.

86
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,240
And I'm like, wow, that is super scary.

87
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,680
Like, if you're somebody, this individual, that already feels out of place, and now you

88
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,320
feel uncomfortable and harassed, but you're depending on this job to feed your family,

89
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,320
and your only recourse is to go to the CEO of the company and say, I demand that you

90
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,360
do something about this.

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,600
What is the chances that you will do that?

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,520
Such a scary thing and such a burden to put on somebody's shoulders, it's just not right.

93
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,920
No.

94
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,040
And then there's also other costs, like the people who witness that kind of behavior,

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:43,840
that harassment or discrimination, they're taking that data in about this is what happens

96
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,500
here and this is what underrepresented people have to deal with.

97
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:55,520
So when things happen again and nothing happens, there is an impact to bystanders as well.

98
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,680
There's an impact to everybody, not just the person who is discriminated against.

99
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,880
So yeah, it's funny, I had to drop my dog off at the vet the other day, and as we were

100
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,920
leaving, there was a woman who'd been hit on her bicycle on the road, and she was in

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:22,960
the curb lane, almost unconscious, she had like, it was really intense.

102
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,800
And people hadn't stopped.

103
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:35,400
So I've been thinking a lot this week about what happens when bystanders overt their eyes,

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,000
when they see something that's clearly not okay, and they go by.

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,540
And then I don't think any of the people who drove by were bad people.

106
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,400
And I don't think that I'm a good person.

107
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,920
There wasn't a decision in my mind that was like, get out of the car and run over, like

108
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,360
it just happened.

109
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,160
But as soon as I kind of, I don't know, pop that bubble of bystanderness, other people

110
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,600
stopped, a trucker stopped, and he ran into the vet to grab gloves, a woman parked her

111
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,920
car behind to keep this woman safe.

112
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,320
I called the ambulance while someone who had more first aid experience stepped in, like,

113
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,640
it just takes one person to kind of name something and follow up with some action, and other

114
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,040
things start to happen.

115
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,960
So it's kind of an extreme example of a cyclist on the road, but something I've been thinking

116
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
a lot about this week.

117
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,360
Yeah, no, no, no, I think that's a very good example.

118
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
And I've seen that a lot.

119
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,680
And I think it's because I think there's so much judgment going on that nobody wants

120
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,700
to be the first one, because you're always afraid of what if I do the wrong thing?

121
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,160
Does this person want my help?

122
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,760
There's so much confusion these days about what's okay and what's not okay.

123
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,080
I think that makes a lot of us stand back and say, I think I'm rather not going to

124
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
get involved until you see other people.

125
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,440
And then I think our natural humanity kicks in, where we then want to all band together

126
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,800
and see if we can change the situation.

127
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,720
I saw that you, in an interview you had on open spaces, open scapes, sorry, I keep reading

128
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,640
it as open spaces.

129
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,280
In this, you mentioned two books, and I love these titles, I'm definitely going to read

130
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,320
these books, but I want you to dig it into them a little bit.

131
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,720
So it's Braiding Sweetgrass and All We Can Save.

132
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,780
What about those two books have been so influential?

133
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:36,920
One of my first clients when I set up my consulting business was open scapes.

134
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,240
And they're a data science group that they teach data science skills to researchers.

135
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,640
So they're working with fisheries researchers, Julie Lownes, or Dr. Julie Lownes, Julie Squid

136
00:09:50,640 --> 00:10:01,760
on Twitter, she's got a PhD in squid, was seeing how do we teach data science skills

137
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,600
to academic researchers in a cohort model.

138
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,800
And they hired me to help think about DEI early on.

139
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,920
And some of the early things that I would do with a company around looking at HR data,

140
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,880
that wasn't it, because there was just a couple of them, but thinking about how to weave or

141
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,280
look through what they were doing through the lens of DEI, had us going down some interesting

142
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
conversations.

143
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,400
Like she's a marine biologist, my background is in the library and information studies,

144
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,440
and I'm a DEI leader now.

145
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:46,640
So it's like kind of a co-creation and a co-design, putting our passions, our values and like putting

146
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,240
our two heads together to be like, what is the perspective on DEI here?

147
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:01,320
And one of the conversations we had early on was like, who can afford to do open science

148
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,560
and to learn openly?

149
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,800
And most of the people she was working with were white researchers with PhDs.

150
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,720
So I was thinking like, who is the most on the margins here?

151
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,240
Where are the black researchers and where are the indigenous researchers?

152
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,080
And like not only how do we get those people to the table and how do we work with them,

153
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,640
but also like what can we learn from them?

154
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,440
And I knew I didn't have the answers on what are some indigenous perspectives on data science

155
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,640
and working together collaboratively in the sciences.

156
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,380
So we kind of started doing this.

157
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,520
She recommended these two books, All We Can Save, which is different perspectives on climate

158
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
change.

159
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,700
It's such an inspiring book and it gives me so much hope.

160
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:59,880
There's this great Venn diagram from Dr. Iana Elizabeth Johnson, she did a TED talk recently.

161
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:07,120
Because I think like with climate change and DEI, there's a similar feeling of overwhelm

162
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,480
and like, what do I do?

163
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,520
And it's so overwhelming.

164
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:17,080
So people are stuck in inaction and just like overwhelm.

165
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,080
So for me, her Venn diagram about what you should do is the overlap about what brings

166
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,400
you joy?

167
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,080
What's the work that needs doing and what skills do you have?

168
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,880
I think that's a really useful model, both to think about what our individual and collective

169
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,680
actions can be around climate change, but also how we show up around DEI and organizations.

170
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,120
Like what brings you joy?

171
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,840
Like don't sign up to do something or commit to do something that is absolute drudgery

172
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,040
or an absolute chore.

173
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,880
Like you're going to hate it and you're not going to do it.

174
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,640
But being clear about like, what's the work that needs doing?

175
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:08,680
Maybe it is around building better anti-harassment policies in your organization.

176
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,480
Maybe it's around product and accessibility, like those are two very, very different problems.

177
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,220
So being clear on the problem you're trying to solve.

178
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,580
And then like, what skills do you have?

179
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,000
You and I, we share some values around the open internet, but we have very different

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,960
backgrounds and very different skills and probably very different things in our toolboxes.

181
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,980
So what you can bring to a problem and what I can bring are very different.

182
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,400
So like, what's your area of genius and what are you going to do?

183
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,880
Yeah, I know.

184
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,120
I really like it.

185
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,280
You shared that diagram with me in the document and that is actually something I've been struggling

186
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
with.

187
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,920
I'm trying to find that what should I do?

188
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:57,240
And that is a very nice framework for thinking through this, like thinking about because,

189
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,560
I mean, our lives are finite and it's kind of pointless to spend all our time doing something

190
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,640
we don't, that doesn't bring us joy and that doesn't feel fulfilling and that doesn't seem

191
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,160
to have a purpose.

192
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,480
And I know there's also a bit of privilege in that, in that you can think about those

193
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,280
things, but I wish we can get to a place where more people can think about this because I

194
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,880
don't think it should be a privilege.

195
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,200
I think we all should have the ability to think through what brings us joy and be able

196
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,560
to make decisions for our lives that include having meaning and finding joy in the work

197
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
we do.

198
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,980
Well, you inviting me on your podcast and also welcoming conversations about culture

199
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:47,120
and psychological safety and inclusion into a podcast where your audience is mostly like

200
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,400
developers and startup folks, like that, your podcast brings you joy.

201
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,800
What are the skills that you've got?

202
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,240
Like you're a host and a convener of conversations that go out much more broadly than just the

203
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,920
two of us.

204
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,920
And what are you good at?

205
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,040
Like, you're good at being a bridge to those worlds.

206
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
So thank you.

207
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,120
Thank you for getting me here.

208
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,720
Like one of the things you are doing is this.

209
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Yeah, that's very true.

210
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,240
I'm getting chills with this stuff.

211
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
So thank you for saying that.

212
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
Yeah.

213
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Well, that's very true.

214
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Yeah.

215
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Thank you so much for sharing that.

216
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Oh, can I?

217
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
Yeah, go for it.

218
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:37,000
The other book you asked about was Braiding Sweetgrass and Robin Wall Kimner is.

219
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't know.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,600
Like it's a book that braids together different strands of stuff.

221
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,640
There's like some of the biology stuff, like indigenous perspectives on biology, some of

222
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,440
her story and it's woven together.

223
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,400
I listen to it as an audiobook because I have a hard time reading books and I would listen

224
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,240
to it early in the morning as I was pottering around and just sometimes I would listen to

225
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
it outside.

226
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,300
And it's a beautiful book that actually kind of shifted my perspective on how we know things

227
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,760
and like what science is.

228
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,960
So I'd encourage either you to read the book or listen to it.

229
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
It's really good.

230
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Yeah, not for sure.

231
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,800
I definitely owe my list.

232
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,800
I heard this quote the other day, I listened to a different podcast and the artist Grimes.

233
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,000
Apparently it's a quote from a Star Wars movie and I think one of the things that you said

234
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,520
is very similar to what she said, the quote that she had from that is, don't kill what

235
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,320
you hate, save what you love.

236
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,480
I think that was really beautiful.

237
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,360
I heard that and I was like, holy cow, that's something I want to remember.

238
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,880
Don't spend your energy trying to kill what you hate, rather spend your energy saving

239
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
what you love.

240
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,040
And I think this diagram plays into that as well.

241
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,920
So yeah, that was inspiring.

242
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,880
What are you trying to save right now?

243
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,200
What do you love?

244
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:12,680
So I want to create opportunity for others because I feel laced in the things that happened

245
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
to me.

246
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
I've taken chances.

247
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:23,960
I mean, before I started my job at Mozilla way back 11 years ago, I quit my job before

248
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:30,640
having had them tell me that they're going to hire me just because I didn't feel joy

249
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
where I was.

250
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
I really didn't like it.

251
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
It was killing me.

252
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:41,120
The commute, the insane hours you had to work, the people just literally not having any appreciation

253
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
for the work you did.

254
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,840
I was sick of it.

255
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,160
And even being married and having kids at that time, I knew I had a bit of a fallback

256
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,720
with my parents that they could support and help if things really went bad.

257
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,440
But I didn't do it just because of that, just because I had the safety net.

258
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,040
I just felt I couldn't do it longer.

259
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,560
And through the years, I have met so many amazing people and I've had such life-changing

260
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:15,260
experiences through Mozilla and through the people that I've met and worked with that

261
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:22,740
I want to create those opportunities for other people using the connections I have.

262
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,600
So that's why I created the podcast.

263
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,340
That's why I created the community because I know one of the struggles these people have

264
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:36,160
is being visible, being seen, having work to show to employers.

265
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,720
Oftentimes, they lose out because, wow, how much experience you have?

266
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
What have you made?

267
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Well, nothing.

268
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,880
I'm still learning, but I just want my first chance.

269
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,560
So I want to give them that first chance, even if it is, not even if it is, but using

270
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,240
open source as a tool for that, creating open source projects and running them like real

271
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,480
projects and giving people real tasks to do in the open where they can then point to and

272
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
say, I've done this.

273
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,080
And here you can see not only that I can write code, but that I can work as a team, that

274
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,560
I can take feedback, that I can give feedback because all of those things are important

275
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:19,880
and that I can start discussions and bring up new ideas and all that kind of stuff.

276
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,160
And then giving them this vehicle where you can literally, where you can hear their voice.

277
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,440
So that's what's important to me.

278
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:37,160
I love to see a world where people are just happier, to be honest.

279
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,160
On a day-to-day basis, I look around me and I see so many people that are clearly not

280
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:48,080
happy and it comes out as anger and it comes out as people push each other away.

281
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,800
And I think it's simply because people are frustrated, they're scared, and they're unhappy.

282
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:02,840
And if I can do a little something to help someone, even if it's one person, then I would

283
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,040
feel like it was worth it.

284
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,080
I'm also hearing another layer in the opportunities you're working to have in open source for

285
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,280
new developers to look and be able to say, I did that.

286
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,360
They're making a real contribution to a real project that has real world impact.

287
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,840
It's not a portfolio assignment, it's not something for a class.

288
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,240
Not that there's anything wrong with those things, but there's something different about

289
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,440
contributing to something that's bigger than what you can do on your own.

290
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,640
There's a learning, but for me, what's so powerful about open source and open science

291
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,600
and open learning is just I feel part of something bigger.

292
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,640
And I love that feeling on a team where it's like one plus one equals not two, but it's

293
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
like seven.

294
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
We're really more than the sum of our parts.

295
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,000
When that magic happens, I feel so alive and I just feel like, yes, let's do this.

296
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,800
We can tackle big challenges together.

297
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,280
We can do brave things together.

298
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Yeah, for sure.

299
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Yeah.

300
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,800
And that is the idea is to build things that have impact.

301
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,840
One of the projects is this curation thing where we want to make it easier for new developers

302
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,720
to find the information and the learning tools that they need.

303
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,880
Because the more and more I speak with people, the problem is not content.

304
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,000
We're drowning in content, we're drowning in information.

305
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,720
It's knowing where to find the things that work for you and also being able to guide

306
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,080
people down different pathways because some people learn well.

307
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,960
For example, you said you prefer to listen to books.

308
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,660
Some people prefer to read books.

309
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,500
Some people prefer video.

310
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,920
So try and find these different resources because they all exist.

311
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,480
But it's finding them and curating them into the space where they then are easily consumable.

312
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,400
And in doing that, you're contributing to something that has real world impact.

313
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,300
You could potentially impact somebody else's life because they're like, wow, this resource

314
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,000
has made it easy for me to learn this thing.

315
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,160
Now I can contribute back to it and I might be able to get a job through all of this.

316
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,080
And now you've taken somebody who might not have known how they're going to go about this

317
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
or somebody that was in a job that they weren't happy and they wanted to really do something

318
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,080
and you created this opportunity for them.

319
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:36,580
So it's this self-fulfilling circle of life type of thing that happens.

320
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,320
This is reminding me about the ideas toolkit that I worked on with the Carpentries, which

321
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:54,080
is a global nonprofit that teaches data science and coding skills to researchers worldwide.

322
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,160
I feel similarly about diversity, equity, inclusion, and information.

323
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,280
There's tons of toolkits out there.

324
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,320
A lot of people just want to know, tell me the 10 things I need to do.

325
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:12,880
And it was an interesting project because there was this need for like tactical, like

326
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,080
what do we need to do?

327
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,100
But a lot of it is also mindset stuff and like perspective shifting.

328
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:27,680
So working with Dr. Carrie Jordan, who's an amazing woman with a PhD in engineering, she's

329
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,520
the executive director of the Carpentries.

330
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,200
Like we went back and forth, we worked with different community members around the world

331
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,160
and their community, and there was this tension between like, tell us what to do, but also

332
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:48,800
like we need this to be meaningful and flexible and applicable and yeah, all over the world

333
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,080
in different contexts, like in the university context, in the community context, and it's

334
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,240
like, oh, like how are we going to do this?

335
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,840
And what we came up with was like for each one of these topics, inclusion, diversity,

336
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,280
equity, and accessibility, we looked at like things you can think about.

337
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:19,160
So like kind of open-ended coaching questions to provoke discussion or to help people who

338
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:25,880
are reading it go a little deeper and think about like what their stake is, what they

339
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,600
can do, and then balance that with like some tactical things that people can do.

340
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:38,200
Yeah, I think combining those two is based on both, I think it's what you need.

341
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,960
When you say accessibility, what does that mean to you?

342
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:53,320
When I say accessibility, I mean barrier-free access for people with disabilities.

343
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,680
But I'm like, is that the right definition?

344
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:09,560
Whether it's digital space, digital information, physical space, or even like an environment,

345
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:15,040
what are the conditions necessary or what are the different ways in so that anyone and

346
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:22,640
everyone, whether they are disabled or not disabled, can use the information, participate

347
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,280
in the setting, make their contributions?

348
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:34,840
And from a universal design kind of perspective, allowing for some of those affordances and

349
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,800
different ways of entry and participation, it also means that a lot of other people can

350
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,280
participate as well.

351
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,200
Like one of the examples from the physical world is a curb cut.

352
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,880
So like in a curb, like having an incline so that someone in a wheelchair can get on

353
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
and off the curb.

354
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,640
But also a delivery person pushing a large trolley with heavy packages on it can also

355
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,120
get up on the curb.

356
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,320
And for me, when I'm walking my bike, it's easier to get my bike up on the curb.

357
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,680
Like that curb cut is necessary for a person using a wheelchair to access that space.

358
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,600
And it also makes it a lot easier for some other users to use that space.

359
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Yeah.

360
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
I love it when...

361
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
What do you mean by accessibility?

362
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Yeah.

363
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
Pretty much the same thing.

364
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,680
I mean, I often look at it from a web perspective, of course, because being a front engineer,

365
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,080
that's where I can most have the most impact in that area.

366
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:40,440
But I do love these examples where making something accessible actually benefits everyone.

367
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,200
I think we're seeing more and more of that giving people choice between, do you prefer

368
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,360
dark mode or do you prefer light or do you prefer to switch between day and night?

369
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,720
Something as simple as that.

370
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,600
I think just having the options there is a good thing.

371
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,640
So for me, I mostly think about that.

372
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,640
But for me, accessibility is not just using the right HTML elements.

373
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:13,200
It's also about if I'm in a third world country on a low grade Android phone, can I even open

374
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,760
your website?

375
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,840
Because what load shedding has taught me is that...

376
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,600
So to me, maybe people wouldn't know what load shedding is.

377
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,040
Sorry, what was that word you said?

378
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
Load shedding.

379
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Load shedding?

380
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Yes.

381
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,340
Let me step back and maybe explain what that is.

382
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,280
So I think in other places it's called rolling blackouts.

383
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,360
So basically what it is is our electricity grid is under so much strain because of years

384
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,520
of ill maintenance and corruption and all these wonderful things that as soon as there's

385
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:50,440
anything that causes high demand, the grid starts to crumble and things starts to break

386
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
down.

387
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,120
And so what they have to do to avoid a complete blackout is they have to, on different schedules,

388
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,260
depending on how bad it is, they have to switch the power off for a certain area.

389
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,600
So you'll be without power for two hours and then you'll get power back and the area next

390
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,320
to you will lose power.

391
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,080
And so it will go every day depending.

392
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,320
Sometimes it'll be for four hours if it's really bad.

393
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:22,880
And so besides the fact that I have to continuously shift meetings around or not be able to attend

394
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,560
meetings, one of the things I've started doing recently is I just started using my phone

395
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,080
as like a mobile hotspot.

396
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:40,400
And sometimes though, especially when there's these long bouts of load shedding going on,

397
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,320
then I get like a 3G connection.

398
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,440
And it's fascinating to find that for people with a 3G connection, the internet almost

399
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,240
doesn't exist.

400
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,800
You can get to nothing.

401
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,180
A web page is like you try and do a search, it just doesn't load.

402
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:01,960
Or you would wait two minutes just for the first two, three results to come back.

403
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,640
And you just think that there are people whose that is their life every day.

404
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,440
Not just in a load shedding environment, that is their life every day.

405
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,720
And I think when our electricity is on and our power is running fine, I mean, I have

406
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,200
a 5G connection.

407
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,120
And so you don't realize how slow things are because everything is just instantaneous.

408
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,140
It's when that 5G goes away and you get that reality check that this is not what everybody

409
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,600
experiences the web like.

410
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,920
Some people experience it like that.

411
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,480
Then you think about that that is such a huge part of the accessibility of the internet

412
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,900
is thinking about, wait a minute, before we decide to use this massive framework, how's

413
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,320
this going to impact our users?

414
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,600
Are they even going to be able to open our website?

415
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,240
Because it doesn't matter how great our app is.

416
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,680
If you can't open it up, it's useless.

417
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,160
It can be the greatest app in the world that can solve world hunger.

418
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,260
But if the people who need it can't open the app, it's of no use to them.

419
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:11,760
So sometimes it's interesting to be put in these situations that's, I mean, honestly

420
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,880
infuriating, but at the same time, eye-opening.

421
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
It makes you think again.

422
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:25,360
And it makes you second guess when you just would have easily installed this extra dependency.

423
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,120
It makes you think, wait a minute, what is that going to do down the line to the people

424
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,600
who want to actually use this thing?

425
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
Do I really need that thing?

426
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
So it makes you ask those questions.

427
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:44,080
And I think there's a diversity, equity, and inclusion kind of lens to this as well.

428
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
One of the questions you sent me was like, what's the biggest problem in tech?

429
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,240
And I'm like, oh, I don't even know how to answer that.

430
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,560
But now I've got the answer listening to you.

431
00:30:51,560 --> 00:31:00,600
I think when we've got only people in Silicon Valley from Stanford who have the newest iPhone

432
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:10,960
and the fastest connections or whatever and skew male, white, and a certain age, we miss

433
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
out.

434
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,800
And things that are common sense or what might be common sense to you and common sense to

435
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,640
me might just be outside of people's experience.

436
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,000
So if we're trying to design things really for everyone, we need everyone at the table.

437
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,040
And everyone needs to have a voice.

438
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,320
And it can't be an afterthought.

439
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,840
It has to happen from the beginning.

440
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,640
So it's not like, uh-oh, the world's greatest app, we need to figure out what the 3G access

441
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
is going to be.

442
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,720
It's like, let's design from the beginning knowing that that is going to be the access

443
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,080
point for some people.

444
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,560
And the process of doing that will lead to different outcomes.

445
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Yeah.

446
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Yeah.

447
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
I agree.

448
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,600
This conversation is making me think a lot.

449
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
That's why I'm pausing.

450
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,600
That's why I'm pausing every now and again.

451
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,400
What's going on in your head?

452
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
A lot.

453
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,400
That's the problem.

454
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,920
So I was thinking about this other thing.

455
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,440
So I mentioned this in the doc that I shared.

456
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,120
So one of the core goals of the Mycelium Network is to be welcome and to celebrate diversity

457
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
and empower people.

458
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:22,160
I think I've also said that with some of the things I've said earlier.

459
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,600
But sometimes you do run into situations, I haven't had to deal with it, but sometimes

460
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:35,280
you do run into situations where people do come in and try to disrupt a good thing.

461
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,600
What is the best way to prepare yourself for this?

462
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,240
But then even with all the reparation in the world, sometimes these things still happen.

463
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,320
So not only how do you prepare, but what are good techniques for handling a situation where

464
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,640
somebody comes in and to be disruptive?

465
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,800
It's interesting because the research shows that more diverse groups have more conflict

466
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,720
as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

467
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,760
But I think when we come from different backgrounds, our common sense will be very different.

468
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:17,680
So being explicit about those group norms, when we say welcoming, what does that mean?

469
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,520
What does that look like in Slack?

470
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,580
What does that look like when we meet in person?

471
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,200
What does that look like when we meet on Zoom or whatever?

472
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:33,040
Talking about the behaviors that we want to see, but also concretely, what does that look

473
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
like?

474
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,000
I think a lot about unwritten rules.

475
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,320
So with a lot of my clients, I've asked, what are the unwritten rules here?

476
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,880
Because every community and every group has unwritten rules.

477
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,760
People who come over to my house, they just take their shoes off because they know, I

478
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,160
don't wear my shoes in my house.

479
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,600
And my close friends who come over for dinner know, I go to bed early and I'm going to be

480
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,800
really clear and be like, hey, it's 8 o'clock and 15 minutes, I'm kicking you out.

481
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
And no one's offended.

482
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,120
They're just like, you're really direct.

483
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,520
I don't have these long, lingering, awkward goodbyes or I'm starting to get resentful

484
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,000
because I'm tired.

485
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,160
But we can do that at work as well.

486
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:24,480
So being explicit about group norms so that people can, new people can come in and know

487
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:32,320
what the rules are, both the official rules and the unofficial rules.

488
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,800
And when behavior is not in alignment with that, we can have a conversation.

489
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:45,740
We can say, we say we value all voices and have a norm around making sure that people

490
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,760
don't hog all the meeting time.

491
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,760
I've noticed in the last couple of meetings, it's the same guy who's taking up 90% of the

492
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
meeting time.

493
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,480
Like, what do we want to do here?

494
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,200
And what is the opportunity?

495
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,880
What are we missing out?

496
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,760
Is he aware that he's using up all the airspace?

497
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,780
Like all these things, but we have to be on the same page about what we value, what those

498
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,160
behaviors look like.

499
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,600
And like those unwritten rules, we also kind of need to make them explicit, especially

500
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,600
in international environments.

501
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,520
Yeah.

502
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:33,960
So when you say the unwritten rules, does this concept of remote first play into that?

503
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,000
Because for me, that is kind of important.

504
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,440
Like I think Mozilla, I keep going back to Mozilla because it's just something I know

505
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,440
really well.

506
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,600
I think they started out as a remote first company, but have become a remote friendly

507
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
company.

508
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,400
And there's a distinct difference between the two.

509
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,760
And I always try to think remote first.

510
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,640
And one of the things is always try to think who's not in the room and how you can include

511
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,480
them.

512
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,760
So does that play into this idea of the unwritten rules to actually write down the unwritten

513
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,560
rules?

514
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,840
I think writing them down can be helpful.

515
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,400
It's always a little awkward at first because people are like, I don't know.

516
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:30,700
But if you tease out or ask, people know what they are.

517
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,160
And it's kind of cool working with a group where people start to trust and like start

518
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,440
to say the things that we all know that are true, but we don't say out loud.

519
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,240
I think that's really powerful.

520
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,800
For me, like the last couple of years have been really interesting with the pandemic

521
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,720
and how we've adopted to work.

522
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:01,680
I think for me, if it's remote first or remote friendly, I think it's important that we're

523
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,920
using the label that's in alignment with what's actually happening.

524
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,520
And I think this is a DEI thing as well, because all companies will say on their careers page,

525
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,160
you know, DEI is part of our DNA.

526
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,720
It's like, well, what does that mean for you?

527
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Like what does that concretely look like?

528
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,080
Show me the receipts.

529
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,000
So if a company says they are remote first, like, I'm curious, like, what does that mean

530
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
for them?

531
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,040
That is a thing.

532
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
How do people gather?

533
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,160
And like, who gathers in person?

534
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Who doesn't?

535
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Like, show me the receipts.

536
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,160
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

537
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,400
Yeah, because I mean, I'm struggling with that myself.

538
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:54,320
Like, I say that I want to do whatever I create, whether it be the company that I'm sort of

539
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,800
kind of building or the community or, you know, whatever it may be.

540
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,960
I do believe in the concept, but at the same time, I'm struggling to really define it.

541
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,040
I sit in front of a page and think I'm going to write about remote first and what it is.

542
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,220
And I really find it hard to nail it down.

543
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,120
And then I start searching online to try and find, like, who are the companies that really

544
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
do this well?

545
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,840
Ah, I've heard about Automatic.

546
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,980
They seem to be doing it really well, but I can't really find anywhere where even somebody

547
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,600
like Matt Muldenweg has really defined what that really is.

548
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,360
Like here is the 10 things.

549
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,120
And I think maybe that's part of the problem.

550
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,800
Maybe we always want a list of things.

551
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,880
And I don't think it's always that cut and dry that you can just list it.

552
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,800
It's more a feeling.

553
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,840
You can feel when a company is remote first.

554
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:03,360
Certain things just happen naturally without having to necessarily mandate anything.

555
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,600
And therefore, nobody really sits down.

556
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,360
So I think that plays to the unwritten rules that you've mentioned.

557
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:16,600
It's unwritten rules that you've never really thought to write down because it doesn't feel

558
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,400
like it needs to be written down.

559
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,840
It almost feels like it's you just know that that's how things are done.

560
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:32,400
So yeah, but I'm thinking of the ideas toolkit here, like maybe that one of the mindset pieces

561
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,840
and like, what are the tactical things like?

562
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,640
So what is the mindset of being remote first?

563
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:46,000
And tactically, what does that look like with the real world constraints of time zones,

564
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,800
work life balance, load shedding and rolling blackouts?

565
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,720
Like all of the myriad of ways that we work and prefer to work and like to work.

566
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,480
And what does that mean for accessibility?

567
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,760
I don't know how often you work with developers and web developers, maybe even specifically,

568
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,600
but as they enter this world, and some people are literally young folks in their early 20s

569
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,160
that's like just doing this, some are people in their 50s, some are in between deciding

570
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,280
that the career that they they've been doing, and I think that that's happened a lot in

571
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,560
the last two years where people have like realized that I don't want to go back to the

572
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,920
job I had before this pandemic, because I really was unhappy.

573
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,240
And some of it is out of fear, because people fear that they will lose their jobs to robots.

574
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,040
Whether that's justified or not is a completely separate topic.

575
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,400
But you can't, like I say, you can't argue with somebody's experience.

576
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,140
You can argue with an opinion, but you can't argue with somebody's experience.

577
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,840
So if you experience fear, and you want to do something, and you've decided that what

578
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,480
you're going to do is you're going to learn how to code, and you're going to get into

579
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,480
this industry.

580
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,560
Like, what are the things that that advice that you would give them from a from a DNI,

581
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,600
like fulfilling life perspective?

582
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:23,360
This is more from a coaching perspective, I think, especially for people like, actually

583
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:29,680
for anyone, and whether they're new, or you've been doing this for 20 years, like, there's

584
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,960
something really honest about writing down your goals, your professional development

585
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,840
goals, your goals, where you want to take a stand for DEI, writing them down, like,

586
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,760
there's something for me about putting something down on paper, where I can step back and look

587
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
at it.

588
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,560
And I can also pull it out in the future and be like, I said this was important to me.

589
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,120
How am I doing there?

590
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,320
So thinking about where you want to develop and how you wanted to develop, not just like

591
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,740
on the technical skills, but like, what are the soft skills or the interpersonal skills

592
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,840
or the collaboration skills you want to build?

593
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:12,800
Like if you say you want to help new people bridge into open source, what are you doing?

594
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,680
Like what's the plan for the next year, six months, three months?

595
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
What are you doing this month?

596
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,460
What are you doing this week?

597
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,480
So taking those bigger goals and breaking them down into smaller chunks, and then building

598
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:35,680
in accountability, either with your manager, with your trusted friend, with community members.

599
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,420
And you know, you can always drop things off there, but having some rigor to your own development

600
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,720
and investing in how you're growing your skills is super important.

601
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,880
And I think also bringing that to like, how do you want to take a stand for DEI?

602
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:57,040
And what are you doing to make your workplace or software community more inclusive?

603
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,600
Like write it down.

604
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
Set a measurable goal.

605
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Are you doing it?

606
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Yeah.

607
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
Yeah.

608
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
I know.

609
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:11,280
Also, I think like if you're learning new things, for me, I'm an extroverted thinker,

610
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,080
but there's also an accountability and learning with other people.

611
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:22,240
It's cool to like, where I'm stronger on a skill and can help someone who's maybe stuck

612
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:29,320
and then receive that help on a different skill, like we learn better together, like

613
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:34,640
so finding those people where you can help each other get unstuck on a technical problem.

614
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,040
But I think there's also another piece where like we're humaning together, like we're learning,

615
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,400
we're getting stuck, we're helping, we're receiving help, we're supporting each other.

616
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,640
Like for me, that's the real strength and where we can do powerful things.

617
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
So find your people.

618
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Yeah, that's very true.

619
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,880
I mean, I'm experiencing that, but I think maybe it's gotten worse over the last couple

620
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:04,160
of years because before the pandemic and all of this, there would be times when I would

621
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,600
get together with other colleagues and we will have an in-person thing and like that

622
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,360
hasn't happened for three years or so now.

623
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,040
And I'm definitely starting to feel that.

624
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,880
I'm starting to feel the fact that I've been remote for a long, long time and really remote

625
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,600
if you want to call it that, the last three years.

626
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:35,200
And I do miss that in-person almost collaboration, but even if it's just being on a video call

627
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,920
together with somebody else and like working together on a thing, like talking through

628
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,640
a problem, I think like, even if you're the mentor and you're just talking through a code

629
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:54,280
problem with somebody, I think it's great to have that human connection and that like

630
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,960
feeling that, oh no, yeah, you're getting it.

631
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,960
You're getting it.

632
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,960
You're almost there.

633
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,960
And like, yeah, that's it.

634
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,960
You got it.

635
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,280
And sometimes it helps you also think through the problem that you haven't thought through

636
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,520
for a while and you actually think of better ways of doing things.

637
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,000
And just that collaboration, that like bouncing ideas of each other and stuff like that, I

638
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
miss that.

639
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,920
And I think it's going to be something that's going to be tricky for us to solve as the

640
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:25,840
world becomes more and more remote and as people seem to almost retreat more into themselves.

641
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:31,040
I think some people have concern about the idea of virtual reality becoming like something

642
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,840
where people really withdraw and completely withdraw into that superficial world and what

643
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,320
the impact of that would be.

644
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:44,120
And I think we kind of had a little bit of a taste of that the last three years and I'm

645
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,720
not so sure that people have handled it really well if they're being honest with themselves.

646
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,880
I think it had a massive mental health impact in a lot of people that they are only now

647
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,880
discovering.

648
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,880
Like for me.

649
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:02,880
Yes, and I became really close to my neighbor by playing Fortnite with her.

650
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:10,320
Not virtual reality, but like video game and we would, you know, she's very good at the

651
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,320
game.

652
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,360
So I got to I got doing something with someone who's something much better than you, it's

653
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,240
something I learned a lot faster.

654
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,840
But we would also just talk about like what what we were proud of that day or like what

655
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:27,760
we were cooking for dinner or like witness other like hard things that we were each going

656
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,760
through.

657
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,760
So both.

658
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,760
I think.

659
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,680
Yeah, I think that's the thing.

660
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,120
It's being able to connect because oftentimes, like you said, you connect over this one thing,

661
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:43,720
but it leads to other conversations that you actually find meaningful.

662
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,280
Yeah, it's interesting.

663
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,880
And I mean, I do I'm not anti all these other things.

664
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,320
I'm not like against VR or anything like that.

665
00:46:53,320 --> 00:47:00,560
I think it has its place, but I think we do we do need to be mindful of how we use this

666
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,360
and how we approach it, that it doesn't become an all consuming thing.

667
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,560
I think a lot of people are talking about the metaverse and about is that the next evolution

668
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,560
of social media?

669
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,720
And it's going to be our downfall, so to speak, because I'm rolling my eyes.

670
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:22,520
Yeah, I know so much about all these things is kind of like, I should probably read more

671
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,520
about it.

672
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,320
So I have a better understanding of what it's all about.

673
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,720
As it seems to have like, just keeps getting more and more momentum, like web three and

674
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
the whole idea.

675
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,600
I mean, some of the web three stuff I do find compelling.

676
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,560
I like the idea of decentralization.

677
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,640
I like the idea of owning your own content.

678
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:48,800
I think it's incredibly important for we've given too much of ourselves away for free

679
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
for the longest time.

680
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,840
So I do like that.

681
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,760
But I think there's a lot of craft going on around that.

682
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,640
That's just toys, sometimes feels like toys for rich people.

683
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:03,320
And I don't know what what it's really going to solve, what it's addressing and what it's

684
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,300
trying to make better.

685
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,000
And so that is a slight concern that I have with some of these things.

686
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,440
But I do think that I need to understand it better, because I can't you can't criticize

687
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,400
something if you don't understand it, right?

688
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,720
You need to at least give it a chance and say, what is this all about?

689
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,520
And then maybe you'll find out that there's just a bunch of a minority of loud voices

690
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,560
that is that is making some things make it seem like it's something it's not.

691
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,320
And if you actually dig into the real deal of what what people actually mean when they

692
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,560
talk about web three, then maybe it is a good thing.

693
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,240
Maybe it is something we need to move towards and embrace.

694
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:51,840
Yeah, so I can keep going for for a while, but I think this was really like delightful

695
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,800
and interesting.

696
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,240
It's really nice to see you and also talk about like things that we both really care

697
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,640
about and some some big ideas like this.

698
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,200
This conversation has really filled me up.

699
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,200
Thank you.

700
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,200
Yeah, no, thank you very much.

701
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,200
This is really good.

702
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,680
It was everything I hoped it would be.

703
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,680
So that's great.

704
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,680
Me too.

705
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,680
Thanks so much, Dora.

706
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,680
I hope you have a lovely day and I hope you can chat again.

707
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,680
That would be really good.

708
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
Yeah.

709
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,040

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,440
and we can do big things together.

712
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,440
So yeah.

713
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,440
Yeah.
