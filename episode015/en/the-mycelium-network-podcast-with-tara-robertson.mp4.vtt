Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:10.160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.560
Hey, Tara, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.560
Thank you so much for joining me.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.560
Thank you for inviting me.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.560
I'm excited to be here.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.600
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

00:20.600 --> 00:25.760
So I know you from the days at Mozilla when you used to work there, and I'm still there

00:25.760 --> 00:30.440
to some extent, but you've moved on and started your own company.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.440
And I know the work, I followed the work that you did at Mozilla, and I've been following

00:34.440 --> 00:36.880
the work you've been doing with your own company.

00:36.880 --> 00:44.800
And I really appreciate and respect your input and the way you look at a lot of things.

00:44.800 --> 00:47.400
And I think this podcast is going to be a little different than some of the others I've

00:47.400 --> 00:51.440
done, but it's intentionally so, because I think these are really important topics to

00:51.440 --> 00:53.040
talk about.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.540
And for early-stage people, I think they need to understand that there's more to the tech

00:58.540 --> 01:02.320
industry and more to a job than just writing code.

01:02.320 --> 01:07.280
How we work with each other and how we interact is as critical as the code we write.

01:07.280 --> 01:16.600
And oftentimes, an unwelcoming environment is going to lead to not great work.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.960
And so your code might actually end up suffering because the environment's not great.

01:20.960 --> 01:25.720
And I think I've also spoken to some women that has had it a little tough, especially

01:25.720 --> 01:34.760
the one, Pamela, who came from Mexico, where being the only woman in the room was definitely

01:34.760 --> 01:39.080
hard and definitely tough, and it did affect how comfortable she felt.

01:39.080 --> 01:44.160
And you don't voice your opinion in those situations, and that is a loss for the company

01:44.160 --> 01:49.600
because we want diverse voices, because it makes our products better, it makes our everything

01:49.600 --> 01:50.600
better.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.800
And that's why I wanted to have a chat about this.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.880
So but I don't want to ramble on.

01:55.880 --> 02:01.240
I want to give you the floor, and I want you to tell us about who you are.

02:01.240 --> 02:05.560
And please take as much time as you want, go as far back as you want, and be as detailed

02:05.560 --> 02:07.360
as you want.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
Thanks.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.120
So my name is Tara Robertson.

02:11.120 --> 02:16.280
I'm in Vancouver, Canada on the unceded traditional territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and

02:16.280 --> 02:20.080
Tsleil-Waututh First Nations.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.280
Making a land acknowledgement like this is fairly common in Canada, but I think if we're

02:24.280 --> 02:28.760
going to talk about power and talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion, like the land that

02:28.760 --> 02:38.680
I'm on and the power dynamics just that exist in a colonial setting, they kind of inform

02:38.680 --> 02:39.680
everything.

02:39.680 --> 02:47.480
I also just think about the land that I'm on, and during the pandemic, the mountains,

02:47.480 --> 02:53.520
the forest, the ocean, like, I've been able to really resource myself and my brain and

02:53.520 --> 02:55.940
my heart and my spirit from the land.

02:55.940 --> 03:02.440
So the land takes care of me, like literally, and we've got a responsibility to figure out

03:02.440 --> 03:06.520
how we take care of the land as well.

03:06.520 --> 03:13.400
That was an attention I expected to go on but yeah, like, and if this is like kind of

03:13.400 --> 03:17.880
the magic of the internet because where it's 11 a.m. where I'm at and it's nighttime where

03:17.880 --> 03:25.720
you are, and we met at a certain time at Mozilla, and before we hopped on, we're just talking

03:25.720 --> 03:30.760
about the fondness that we have for the people and the culture and the work there.

03:30.760 --> 03:36.560
So I kind of love, like at Mozilla, we were finding to keep the internet open and accessible

03:36.560 --> 03:41.960
for all, and right now we're connected through the internet, on the internet, to have this

03:41.960 --> 03:46.120
conversation about culture and how we want to work together.

03:46.120 --> 03:49.120
Yeah, yeah, it's amazing.

03:49.120 --> 03:52.560
So right now, as a consultant, I do two different things.

03:52.560 --> 03:59.880
I do data-driven diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy work with companies and organizations

03:59.880 --> 04:05.160
who want to have, like, an overall strategy so that they can really make this work part

04:05.160 --> 04:10.400
of everything that they do from, like, the employee, the employee experience through

04:10.400 --> 04:15.120
to the marketing team, through the products and services that a company is offering, as

04:15.120 --> 04:17.920
well as stuff like procurement and where they're doing banking.

04:17.920 --> 04:22.080
Like, for me, diversity, equity, and inclusion is a lens that we need to view everything

04:22.080 --> 04:27.600
through, not just, like, how we write a job description and who we hire.

04:27.600 --> 04:36.160
I love what you touched on about, like, people who think it's just about writing code, like,

04:36.160 --> 04:41.880
but work happens, like, in a context, and just thinking about the problems that we have

04:41.880 --> 04:45.200
right now, they're huge in the world, and the problems that we're trying to solve in

04:45.200 --> 04:49.400
tech are really complex, wicked problems.

04:49.400 --> 04:54.320
So we also need an environment where there's psychological safety, and people feel like

04:54.320 --> 04:59.360
they can speak up either with, like, a wildly creative idea that might sound, like, just

04:59.360 --> 05:04.840
way out there, and also speak up when they see something that's wrong.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.720
And both of those things take a lot of courage.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.720
They do.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.400
So, like, there's the individual courage to speak up.

05:10.400 --> 05:15.400
But there's also how the kind of culture that we build day after day together, where we

05:15.400 --> 05:19.840
either build a culture where we can take risks and we're more likely to take those risks

05:19.840 --> 05:27.560
together or not, where we keep our great ideas to ourselves, or when we see something that's

05:27.560 --> 05:30.120
getting shipped, we're like, oh, is that going to break something?

05:30.120 --> 05:31.120
I don't know.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.120
I'm just not going to say anything.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.120
Yeah.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.120
We all lose out.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
Yeah, no, for sure.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.120
For sure.

05:37.120 --> 05:42.960
I mean, and this is something that a previous guest has touched on.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.120
She talked about harassment in the workspace.

05:46.120 --> 05:51.000
And in Mexico, the laws are a little fast and loose when it comes to that.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.880
And basically, she was talking to somebody, and they said, well, one of your options is

05:55.880 --> 05:59.160
to go to the CEO and demand change.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.240
And I'm like, wow, that is super scary.

06:02.240 --> 06:08.680
Like, if you're somebody, this individual, that already feels out of place, and now you

06:08.680 --> 06:14.320
feel uncomfortable and harassed, but you're depending on this job to feed your family,

06:14.320 --> 06:19.320
and your only recourse is to go to the CEO of the company and say, I demand that you

06:19.320 --> 06:21.360
do something about this.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.600
What is the chances that you will do that?

06:23.600 --> 06:29.520
Such a scary thing and such a burden to put on somebody's shoulders, it's just not right.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.920
No.

06:30.920 --> 06:36.040
And then there's also other costs, like the people who witness that kind of behavior,

06:36.040 --> 06:43.840
that harassment or discrimination, they're taking that data in about this is what happens

06:43.840 --> 06:48.500
here and this is what underrepresented people have to deal with.

06:48.500 --> 06:55.520
So when things happen again and nothing happens, there is an impact to bystanders as well.

06:55.520 --> 07:02.680
There's an impact to everybody, not just the person who is discriminated against.

07:02.680 --> 07:09.880
So yeah, it's funny, I had to drop my dog off at the vet the other day, and as we were

07:09.880 --> 07:15.920
leaving, there was a woman who'd been hit on her bicycle on the road, and she was in

07:15.920 --> 07:22.960
the curb lane, almost unconscious, she had like, it was really intense.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.800
And people hadn't stopped.

07:25.800 --> 07:35.400
So I've been thinking a lot this week about what happens when bystanders overt their eyes,

07:35.400 --> 07:40.000
when they see something that's clearly not okay, and they go by.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.540
And then I don't think any of the people who drove by were bad people.

07:44.540 --> 07:47.400
And I don't think that I'm a good person.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.920
There wasn't a decision in my mind that was like, get out of the car and run over, like

07:50.920 --> 07:52.360
it just happened.

07:52.360 --> 07:58.160
But as soon as I kind of, I don't know, pop that bubble of bystanderness, other people

07:58.160 --> 08:03.600
stopped, a trucker stopped, and he ran into the vet to grab gloves, a woman parked her

08:03.600 --> 08:05.920
car behind to keep this woman safe.

08:05.920 --> 08:10.320
I called the ambulance while someone who had more first aid experience stepped in, like,

08:10.320 --> 08:16.640
it just takes one person to kind of name something and follow up with some action, and other

08:16.640 --> 08:18.040
things start to happen.

08:18.040 --> 08:22.960
So it's kind of an extreme example of a cyclist on the road, but something I've been thinking

08:22.960 --> 08:23.960
a lot about this week.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.360
Yeah, no, no, no, I think that's a very good example.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.360
And I've seen that a lot.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.680
And I think it's because I think there's so much judgment going on that nobody wants

08:32.680 --> 08:37.700
to be the first one, because you're always afraid of what if I do the wrong thing?

08:37.700 --> 08:40.160
Does this person want my help?

08:40.160 --> 08:45.760
There's so much confusion these days about what's okay and what's not okay.

08:45.760 --> 08:52.080
I think that makes a lot of us stand back and say, I think I'm rather not going to

08:52.080 --> 08:54.480
get involved until you see other people.

08:54.480 --> 08:59.440
And then I think our natural humanity kicks in, where we then want to all band together

08:59.440 --> 09:04.800
and see if we can change the situation.

09:04.800 --> 09:10.720
I saw that you, in an interview you had on open spaces, open scapes, sorry, I keep reading

09:10.720 --> 09:13.640
it as open spaces.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.280
In this, you mentioned two books, and I love these titles, I'm definitely going to read

09:17.280 --> 09:20.320
these books, but I want you to dig it into them a little bit.

09:20.320 --> 09:25.720
So it's Braiding Sweetgrass and All We Can Save.

09:25.720 --> 09:30.780
What about those two books have been so influential?

09:30.780 --> 09:36.920
One of my first clients when I set up my consulting business was open scapes.

09:36.920 --> 09:43.240
And they're a data science group that they teach data science skills to researchers.

09:43.240 --> 09:50.640
So they're working with fisheries researchers, Julie Lownes, or Dr. Julie Lownes, Julie Squid

09:50.640 --> 10:01.760
on Twitter, she's got a PhD in squid, was seeing how do we teach data science skills

10:01.760 --> 10:07.600
to academic researchers in a cohort model.

10:07.600 --> 10:13.800
And they hired me to help think about DEI early on.

10:13.800 --> 10:19.920
And some of the early things that I would do with a company around looking at HR data,

10:19.920 --> 10:24.880
that wasn't it, because there was just a couple of them, but thinking about how to weave or

10:24.880 --> 10:31.280
look through what they were doing through the lens of DEI, had us going down some interesting

10:31.280 --> 10:32.280
conversations.

10:32.280 --> 10:37.400
Like she's a marine biologist, my background is in the library and information studies,

10:37.400 --> 10:39.440
and I'm a DEI leader now.

10:39.440 --> 10:46.640
So it's like kind of a co-creation and a co-design, putting our passions, our values and like putting

10:46.640 --> 10:53.240
our two heads together to be like, what is the perspective on DEI here?

10:53.240 --> 11:01.320
And one of the conversations we had early on was like, who can afford to do open science

11:01.320 --> 11:03.560
and to learn openly?

11:03.560 --> 11:09.800
And most of the people she was working with were white researchers with PhDs.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.720
So I was thinking like, who is the most on the margins here?

11:13.720 --> 11:18.240
Where are the black researchers and where are the indigenous researchers?

11:18.240 --> 11:23.080
And like not only how do we get those people to the table and how do we work with them,

11:23.080 --> 11:26.640
but also like what can we learn from them?

11:26.640 --> 11:33.440
And I knew I didn't have the answers on what are some indigenous perspectives on data science

11:33.440 --> 11:37.640
and working together collaboratively in the sciences.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.380
So we kind of started doing this.

11:40.380 --> 11:45.520
She recommended these two books, All We Can Save, which is different perspectives on climate

11:45.520 --> 11:46.520
change.

11:46.520 --> 11:52.700
It's such an inspiring book and it gives me so much hope.

11:52.700 --> 11:59.880
There's this great Venn diagram from Dr. Iana Elizabeth Johnson, she did a TED talk recently.

11:59.880 --> 12:07.120
Because I think like with climate change and DEI, there's a similar feeling of overwhelm

12:07.120 --> 12:09.480
and like, what do I do?

12:09.480 --> 12:10.520
And it's so overwhelming.

12:10.520 --> 12:17.080
So people are stuck in inaction and just like overwhelm.

12:17.080 --> 12:23.080
So for me, her Venn diagram about what you should do is the overlap about what brings

12:23.080 --> 12:25.400
you joy?

12:25.400 --> 12:29.080
What's the work that needs doing and what skills do you have?

12:29.080 --> 12:34.880
I think that's a really useful model, both to think about what our individual and collective

12:34.880 --> 12:40.680
actions can be around climate change, but also how we show up around DEI and organizations.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.120
Like what brings you joy?

12:43.120 --> 12:48.840
Like don't sign up to do something or commit to do something that is absolute drudgery

12:48.840 --> 12:50.040
or an absolute chore.

12:50.040 --> 12:54.880
Like you're going to hate it and you're not going to do it.

12:54.880 --> 12:59.640
But being clear about like, what's the work that needs doing?

12:59.640 --> 13:08.680
Maybe it is around building better anti-harassment policies in your organization.

13:08.680 --> 13:14.480
Maybe it's around product and accessibility, like those are two very, very different problems.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.220
So being clear on the problem you're trying to solve.

13:16.220 --> 13:19.580
And then like, what skills do you have?

13:19.580 --> 13:24.000
You and I, we share some values around the open internet, but we have very different

13:24.000 --> 13:28.960
backgrounds and very different skills and probably very different things in our toolboxes.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.980
So what you can bring to a problem and what I can bring are very different.

13:31.980 --> 13:36.400
So like, what's your area of genius and what are you going to do?

13:36.400 --> 13:37.880
Yeah, I know.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.120
I really like it.

13:39.120 --> 13:45.280
You shared that diagram with me in the document and that is actually something I've been struggling

13:45.280 --> 13:46.280
with.

13:46.280 --> 13:50.920
I'm trying to find that what should I do?

13:50.920 --> 13:57.240
And that is a very nice framework for thinking through this, like thinking about because,

13:57.240 --> 14:04.560
I mean, our lives are finite and it's kind of pointless to spend all our time doing something

14:04.560 --> 14:09.640
we don't, that doesn't bring us joy and that doesn't feel fulfilling and that doesn't seem

14:09.640 --> 14:12.160
to have a purpose.

14:12.160 --> 14:18.480
And I know there's also a bit of privilege in that, in that you can think about those

14:18.480 --> 14:22.280
things, but I wish we can get to a place where more people can think about this because I

14:22.280 --> 14:23.880
don't think it should be a privilege.

14:23.880 --> 14:28.200
I think we all should have the ability to think through what brings us joy and be able

14:28.200 --> 14:35.560
to make decisions for our lives that include having meaning and finding joy in the work

14:35.560 --> 14:36.560
we do.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.980
Well, you inviting me on your podcast and also welcoming conversations about culture

14:40.980 --> 14:47.120
and psychological safety and inclusion into a podcast where your audience is mostly like

14:47.120 --> 14:54.400
developers and startup folks, like that, your podcast brings you joy.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.800
What are the skills that you've got?

14:55.800 --> 15:01.240
Like you're a host and a convener of conversations that go out much more broadly than just the

15:01.240 --> 15:02.920
two of us.

15:02.920 --> 15:03.920
And what are you good at?

15:03.920 --> 15:08.040
Like, you're good at being a bridge to those worlds.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.040
So thank you.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.120
Thank you for getting me here.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.720
Like one of the things you are doing is this.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.720
Yeah, that's very true.

15:15.720 --> 15:19.240
I'm getting chills with this stuff.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.240
So thank you for saying that.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240
Yeah.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.240
Well, that's very true.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.240
Yeah.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.240
Thank you so much for sharing that.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.240
Oh, can I?

15:25.240 --> 15:26.240
Yeah, go for it.

15:26.240 --> 15:37.000
The other book you asked about was Braiding Sweetgrass and Robin Wall Kimner is.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
I don't know.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.600
Like it's a book that braids together different strands of stuff.

15:41.600 --> 15:48.640
There's like some of the biology stuff, like indigenous perspectives on biology, some of

15:48.640 --> 15:51.440
her story and it's woven together.

15:51.440 --> 15:58.400
I listen to it as an audiobook because I have a hard time reading books and I would listen

15:58.400 --> 16:03.240
to it early in the morning as I was pottering around and just sometimes I would listen to

16:03.240 --> 16:04.240
it outside.

16:04.240 --> 16:11.300
And it's a beautiful book that actually kind of shifted my perspective on how we know things

16:11.300 --> 16:13.760
and like what science is.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.960
So I'd encourage either you to read the book or listen to it.

16:16.960 --> 16:17.960
It's really good.

16:17.960 --> 16:18.960
Yeah, not for sure.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.800
I definitely owe my list.

16:20.800 --> 16:26.800
I heard this quote the other day, I listened to a different podcast and the artist Grimes.

16:26.800 --> 16:33.000
Apparently it's a quote from a Star Wars movie and I think one of the things that you said

16:33.000 --> 16:38.520
is very similar to what she said, the quote that she had from that is, don't kill what

16:38.520 --> 16:40.320
you hate, save what you love.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.480
I think that was really beautiful.

16:43.480 --> 16:49.360
I heard that and I was like, holy cow, that's something I want to remember.

16:49.360 --> 16:53.880
Don't spend your energy trying to kill what you hate, rather spend your energy saving

16:53.880 --> 16:54.880
what you love.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.040
And I think this diagram plays into that as well.

16:58.040 --> 17:01.920
So yeah, that was inspiring.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.880
What are you trying to save right now?

17:03.880 --> 17:06.200
What do you love?

17:06.200 --> 17:12.680
So I want to create opportunity for others because I feel laced in the things that happened

17:12.680 --> 17:13.680
to me.

17:13.680 --> 17:14.680
I've taken chances.

17:14.680 --> 17:23.960
I mean, before I started my job at Mozilla way back 11 years ago, I quit my job before

17:23.960 --> 17:30.640
having had them tell me that they're going to hire me just because I didn't feel joy

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
where I was.

17:31.640 --> 17:32.640
I really didn't like it.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.640
It was killing me.

17:33.640 --> 17:41.120
The commute, the insane hours you had to work, the people just literally not having any appreciation

17:41.120 --> 17:42.320
for the work you did.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.840
I was sick of it.

17:43.840 --> 17:49.160
And even being married and having kids at that time, I knew I had a bit of a fallback

17:49.160 --> 17:54.720
with my parents that they could support and help if things really went bad.

17:54.720 --> 17:58.440
But I didn't do it just because of that, just because I had the safety net.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.040
I just felt I couldn't do it longer.

18:01.040 --> 18:08.560
And through the years, I have met so many amazing people and I've had such life-changing

18:08.560 --> 18:15.260
experiences through Mozilla and through the people that I've met and worked with that

18:15.260 --> 18:22.740
I want to create those opportunities for other people using the connections I have.

18:22.740 --> 18:25.600
So that's why I created the podcast.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.340
That's why I created the community because I know one of the struggles these people have

18:29.340 --> 18:36.160
is being visible, being seen, having work to show to employers.

18:36.160 --> 18:40.720
Oftentimes, they lose out because, wow, how much experience you have?

18:40.720 --> 18:41.720
What have you made?

18:41.720 --> 18:42.720
Well, nothing.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.880
I'm still learning, but I just want my first chance.

18:45.880 --> 18:51.560
So I want to give them that first chance, even if it is, not even if it is, but using

18:51.560 --> 18:57.240
open source as a tool for that, creating open source projects and running them like real

18:57.240 --> 19:02.480
projects and giving people real tasks to do in the open where they can then point to and

19:02.480 --> 19:04.480
say, I've done this.

19:04.480 --> 19:08.080
And here you can see not only that I can write code, but that I can work as a team, that

19:08.080 --> 19:12.560
I can take feedback, that I can give feedback because all of those things are important

19:12.560 --> 19:19.880
and that I can start discussions and bring up new ideas and all that kind of stuff.

19:19.880 --> 19:25.160
And then giving them this vehicle where you can literally, where you can hear their voice.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.440
So that's what's important to me.

19:28.440 --> 19:37.160
I love to see a world where people are just happier, to be honest.

19:37.160 --> 19:41.160
On a day-to-day basis, I look around me and I see so many people that are clearly not

19:41.160 --> 19:48.080
happy and it comes out as anger and it comes out as people push each other away.

19:48.080 --> 19:54.800
And I think it's simply because people are frustrated, they're scared, and they're unhappy.

19:54.800 --> 20:02.840
And if I can do a little something to help someone, even if it's one person, then I would

20:02.840 --> 20:07.040
feel like it was worth it.

20:07.040 --> 20:14.080
I'm also hearing another layer in the opportunities you're working to have in open source for

20:14.080 --> 20:18.280
new developers to look and be able to say, I did that.

20:18.280 --> 20:23.360
They're making a real contribution to a real project that has real world impact.

20:23.360 --> 20:27.840
It's not a portfolio assignment, it's not something for a class.

20:27.840 --> 20:32.240
Not that there's anything wrong with those things, but there's something different about

20:32.240 --> 20:37.440
contributing to something that's bigger than what you can do on your own.

20:37.440 --> 20:42.640
There's a learning, but for me, what's so powerful about open source and open science

20:42.640 --> 20:47.600
and open learning is just I feel part of something bigger.

20:47.600 --> 20:53.640
And I love that feeling on a team where it's like one plus one equals not two, but it's

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
like seven.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.960
We're really more than the sum of our parts.

20:56.960 --> 21:04.000
When that magic happens, I feel so alive and I just feel like, yes, let's do this.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.800
We can tackle big challenges together.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.280
We can do brave things together.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.280
Yeah, for sure.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.280
Yeah.

21:10.280 --> 21:14.800
And that is the idea is to build things that have impact.

21:14.800 --> 21:20.840
One of the projects is this curation thing where we want to make it easier for new developers

21:20.840 --> 21:25.720
to find the information and the learning tools that they need.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.880
Because the more and more I speak with people, the problem is not content.

21:29.880 --> 21:33.000
We're drowning in content, we're drowning in information.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.720
It's knowing where to find the things that work for you and also being able to guide

21:38.720 --> 21:43.080
people down different pathways because some people learn well.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.960
For example, you said you prefer to listen to books.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.660
Some people prefer to read books.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.500
Some people prefer video.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.920
So try and find these different resources because they all exist.

21:53.920 --> 22:00.480
But it's finding them and curating them into the space where they then are easily consumable.

22:00.480 --> 22:04.400
And in doing that, you're contributing to something that has real world impact.

22:04.400 --> 22:09.300
You could potentially impact somebody else's life because they're like, wow, this resource

22:09.300 --> 22:12.000
has made it easy for me to learn this thing.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.160
Now I can contribute back to it and I might be able to get a job through all of this.

22:17.160 --> 22:22.080
And now you've taken somebody who might not have known how they're going to go about this

22:22.080 --> 22:26.480
or somebody that was in a job that they weren't happy and they wanted to really do something

22:26.480 --> 22:29.080
and you created this opportunity for them.

22:29.080 --> 22:36.580
So it's this self-fulfilling circle of life type of thing that happens.

22:36.580 --> 22:41.320
This is reminding me about the ideas toolkit that I worked on with the Carpentries, which

22:41.320 --> 22:54.080
is a global nonprofit that teaches data science and coding skills to researchers worldwide.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.160
I feel similarly about diversity, equity, inclusion, and information.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.280
There's tons of toolkits out there.

22:59.280 --> 23:03.320
A lot of people just want to know, tell me the 10 things I need to do.

23:03.320 --> 23:12.880
And it was an interesting project because there was this need for like tactical, like

23:12.880 --> 23:15.080
what do we need to do?

23:15.080 --> 23:20.100
But a lot of it is also mindset stuff and like perspective shifting.

23:20.100 --> 23:27.680
So working with Dr. Carrie Jordan, who's an amazing woman with a PhD in engineering, she's

23:27.680 --> 23:30.520
the executive director of the Carpentries.

23:30.520 --> 23:35.200
Like we went back and forth, we worked with different community members around the world

23:35.200 --> 23:41.160
and their community, and there was this tension between like, tell us what to do, but also

23:41.160 --> 23:48.800
like we need this to be meaningful and flexible and applicable and yeah, all over the world

23:48.800 --> 23:55.080
in different contexts, like in the university context, in the community context, and it's

23:55.080 --> 23:58.240
like, oh, like how are we going to do this?

23:58.240 --> 24:05.840
And what we came up with was like for each one of these topics, inclusion, diversity,

24:05.840 --> 24:12.280
equity, and accessibility, we looked at like things you can think about.

24:12.280 --> 24:19.160
So like kind of open-ended coaching questions to provoke discussion or to help people who

24:19.160 --> 24:25.880
are reading it go a little deeper and think about like what their stake is, what they

24:25.880 --> 24:30.600
can do, and then balance that with like some tactical things that people can do.

24:30.600 --> 24:38.200
Yeah, I think combining those two is based on both, I think it's what you need.

24:38.200 --> 24:43.960
When you say accessibility, what does that mean to you?

24:43.960 --> 24:53.320
When I say accessibility, I mean barrier-free access for people with disabilities.

24:53.320 --> 24:59.680
But I'm like, is that the right definition?

24:59.680 --> 25:09.560
Whether it's digital space, digital information, physical space, or even like an environment,

25:09.560 --> 25:15.040
what are the conditions necessary or what are the different ways in so that anyone and

25:15.040 --> 25:22.640
everyone, whether they are disabled or not disabled, can use the information, participate

25:22.640 --> 25:27.280
in the setting, make their contributions?

25:27.280 --> 25:34.840
And from a universal design kind of perspective, allowing for some of those affordances and

25:34.840 --> 25:38.800
different ways of entry and participation, it also means that a lot of other people can

25:38.800 --> 25:40.280
participate as well.

25:40.280 --> 25:46.200
Like one of the examples from the physical world is a curb cut.

25:46.200 --> 25:52.880
So like in a curb, like having an incline so that someone in a wheelchair can get on

25:52.880 --> 25:54.720
and off the curb.

25:54.720 --> 26:01.640
But also a delivery person pushing a large trolley with heavy packages on it can also

26:01.640 --> 26:03.120
get up on the curb.

26:03.120 --> 26:07.320
And for me, when I'm walking my bike, it's easier to get my bike up on the curb.

26:07.320 --> 26:14.680
Like that curb cut is necessary for a person using a wheelchair to access that space.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.600
And it also makes it a lot easier for some other users to use that space.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.600
Yeah.

26:19.600 --> 26:20.600
I love it when...

26:20.600 --> 26:21.600
What do you mean by accessibility?

26:21.600 --> 26:22.600
Yeah.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.600
Pretty much the same thing.

26:23.600 --> 26:28.680
I mean, I often look at it from a web perspective, of course, because being a front engineer,

26:28.680 --> 26:32.080
that's where I can most have the most impact in that area.

26:32.080 --> 26:40.440
But I do love these examples where making something accessible actually benefits everyone.

26:40.440 --> 26:46.200
I think we're seeing more and more of that giving people choice between, do you prefer

26:46.200 --> 26:51.360
dark mode or do you prefer light or do you prefer to switch between day and night?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.720
Something as simple as that.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.600
I think just having the options there is a good thing.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.640
So for me, I mostly think about that.

26:59.640 --> 27:04.640
But for me, accessibility is not just using the right HTML elements.

27:04.640 --> 27:13.200
It's also about if I'm in a third world country on a low grade Android phone, can I even open

27:13.200 --> 27:14.760
your website?

27:14.760 --> 27:18.840
Because what load shedding has taught me is that...

27:18.840 --> 27:21.600
So to me, maybe people wouldn't know what load shedding is.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.040
Sorry, what was that word you said?

27:23.040 --> 27:24.040
Load shedding.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.040
Load shedding?

27:25.040 --> 27:26.040
Yes.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.340
Let me step back and maybe explain what that is.

27:27.340 --> 27:30.280
So I think in other places it's called rolling blackouts.

27:30.280 --> 27:35.360
So basically what it is is our electricity grid is under so much strain because of years

27:35.360 --> 27:42.520
of ill maintenance and corruption and all these wonderful things that as soon as there's

27:42.520 --> 27:50.440
anything that causes high demand, the grid starts to crumble and things starts to break

27:50.440 --> 27:51.440
down.

27:51.440 --> 27:56.120
And so what they have to do to avoid a complete blackout is they have to, on different schedules,

27:56.120 --> 28:01.260
depending on how bad it is, they have to switch the power off for a certain area.

28:01.260 --> 28:05.600
So you'll be without power for two hours and then you'll get power back and the area next

28:05.600 --> 28:07.320
to you will lose power.

28:07.320 --> 28:11.080
And so it will go every day depending.

28:11.080 --> 28:15.320
Sometimes it'll be for four hours if it's really bad.

28:15.320 --> 28:22.880
And so besides the fact that I have to continuously shift meetings around or not be able to attend

28:22.880 --> 28:27.560
meetings, one of the things I've started doing recently is I just started using my phone

28:27.560 --> 28:31.080
as like a mobile hotspot.

28:31.080 --> 28:40.400
And sometimes though, especially when there's these long bouts of load shedding going on,

28:40.400 --> 28:44.320
then I get like a 3G connection.

28:44.320 --> 28:48.440
And it's fascinating to find that for people with a 3G connection, the internet almost

28:48.440 --> 28:50.240
doesn't exist.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.800
You can get to nothing.

28:51.800 --> 28:56.180
A web page is like you try and do a search, it just doesn't load.

28:56.180 --> 29:01.960
Or you would wait two minutes just for the first two, three results to come back.

29:01.960 --> 29:07.640
And you just think that there are people whose that is their life every day.

29:07.640 --> 29:11.440
Not just in a load shedding environment, that is their life every day.

29:11.440 --> 29:16.720
And I think when our electricity is on and our power is running fine, I mean, I have

29:16.720 --> 29:18.200
a 5G connection.

29:18.200 --> 29:25.120
And so you don't realize how slow things are because everything is just instantaneous.

29:25.120 --> 29:30.140
It's when that 5G goes away and you get that reality check that this is not what everybody

29:30.140 --> 29:31.600
experiences the web like.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.920
Some people experience it like that.

29:33.920 --> 29:40.480
Then you think about that that is such a huge part of the accessibility of the internet

29:40.480 --> 29:46.900
is thinking about, wait a minute, before we decide to use this massive framework, how's

29:46.900 --> 29:49.320
this going to impact our users?

29:49.320 --> 29:51.600
Are they even going to be able to open our website?

29:51.600 --> 29:54.240
Because it doesn't matter how great our app is.

29:54.240 --> 29:57.680
If you can't open it up, it's useless.

29:57.680 --> 30:01.160
It can be the greatest app in the world that can solve world hunger.

30:01.160 --> 30:06.260
But if the people who need it can't open the app, it's of no use to them.

30:06.260 --> 30:11.760
So sometimes it's interesting to be put in these situations that's, I mean, honestly

30:11.760 --> 30:16.880
infuriating, but at the same time, eye-opening.

30:16.880 --> 30:17.880
It makes you think again.

30:17.880 --> 30:25.360
And it makes you second guess when you just would have easily installed this extra dependency.

30:25.360 --> 30:29.120
It makes you think, wait a minute, what is that going to do down the line to the people

30:29.120 --> 30:31.600
who want to actually use this thing?

30:31.600 --> 30:33.440
Do I really need that thing?

30:33.440 --> 30:35.440
So it makes you ask those questions.

30:35.440 --> 30:44.080
And I think there's a diversity, equity, and inclusion kind of lens to this as well.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.080
One of the questions you sent me was like, what's the biggest problem in tech?

30:47.080 --> 30:49.240
And I'm like, oh, I don't even know how to answer that.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.560
But now I've got the answer listening to you.

30:51.560 --> 31:00.600
I think when we've got only people in Silicon Valley from Stanford who have the newest iPhone

31:00.600 --> 31:10.960
and the fastest connections or whatever and skew male, white, and a certain age, we miss

31:10.960 --> 31:11.960
out.

31:11.960 --> 31:15.800
And things that are common sense or what might be common sense to you and common sense to

31:15.800 --> 31:18.640
me might just be outside of people's experience.

31:18.640 --> 31:24.000
So if we're trying to design things really for everyone, we need everyone at the table.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.040
And everyone needs to have a voice.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.320
And it can't be an afterthought.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.840
It has to happen from the beginning.

31:29.840 --> 31:35.640
So it's not like, uh-oh, the world's greatest app, we need to figure out what the 3G access

31:35.640 --> 31:36.640
is going to be.

31:36.640 --> 31:41.720
It's like, let's design from the beginning knowing that that is going to be the access

31:41.720 --> 31:43.080
point for some people.

31:43.080 --> 31:47.560
And the process of doing that will lead to different outcomes.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.560
Yeah.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.560
Yeah.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.560
I agree.

31:50.560 --> 31:55.600
This conversation is making me think a lot.

31:55.600 --> 31:56.600
That's why I'm pausing.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.600
That's why I'm pausing every now and again.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.400
What's going on in your head?

32:01.400 --> 32:02.400
A lot.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.400
That's the problem.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.920
So I was thinking about this other thing.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.440
So I mentioned this in the doc that I shared.

32:10.440 --> 32:15.120
So one of the core goals of the Mycelium Network is to be welcome and to celebrate diversity

32:15.120 --> 32:16.120
and empower people.

32:16.120 --> 32:22.160
I think I've also said that with some of the things I've said earlier.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.600
But sometimes you do run into situations, I haven't had to deal with it, but sometimes

32:26.600 --> 32:35.280
you do run into situations where people do come in and try to disrupt a good thing.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.600
What is the best way to prepare yourself for this?

32:37.600 --> 32:42.240
But then even with all the reparation in the world, sometimes these things still happen.

32:42.240 --> 32:49.320
So not only how do you prepare, but what are good techniques for handling a situation where

32:49.320 --> 32:55.640
somebody comes in and to be disruptive?

32:55.640 --> 32:59.800
It's interesting because the research shows that more diverse groups have more conflict

32:59.800 --> 33:04.720
as well, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

33:04.720 --> 33:09.760
But I think when we come from different backgrounds, our common sense will be very different.

33:09.760 --> 33:17.680
So being explicit about those group norms, when we say welcoming, what does that mean?

33:17.680 --> 33:19.520
What does that look like in Slack?

33:19.520 --> 33:22.580
What does that look like when we meet in person?

33:22.580 --> 33:26.200
What does that look like when we meet on Zoom or whatever?

33:26.200 --> 33:33.040
Talking about the behaviors that we want to see, but also concretely, what does that look

33:33.040 --> 33:34.040
like?

33:34.040 --> 33:36.000
I think a lot about unwritten rules.

33:36.000 --> 33:43.320
So with a lot of my clients, I've asked, what are the unwritten rules here?

33:43.320 --> 33:48.880
Because every community and every group has unwritten rules.

33:48.880 --> 33:52.760
People who come over to my house, they just take their shoes off because they know, I

33:52.760 --> 33:54.160
don't wear my shoes in my house.

33:54.160 --> 33:58.600
And my close friends who come over for dinner know, I go to bed early and I'm going to be

33:58.600 --> 34:03.800
really clear and be like, hey, it's 8 o'clock and 15 minutes, I'm kicking you out.

34:03.800 --> 34:04.800
And no one's offended.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.120
They're just like, you're really direct.

34:07.120 --> 34:11.520
I don't have these long, lingering, awkward goodbyes or I'm starting to get resentful

34:11.520 --> 34:13.000
because I'm tired.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.160
But we can do that at work as well.

34:17.160 --> 34:24.480
So being explicit about group norms so that people can, new people can come in and know

34:24.480 --> 34:32.320
what the rules are, both the official rules and the unofficial rules.

34:32.320 --> 34:37.800
And when behavior is not in alignment with that, we can have a conversation.

34:37.800 --> 34:45.740
We can say, we say we value all voices and have a norm around making sure that people

34:45.740 --> 34:48.760
don't hog all the meeting time.

34:48.760 --> 34:54.760
I've noticed in the last couple of meetings, it's the same guy who's taking up 90% of the

34:54.760 --> 34:55.760
meeting time.

34:55.760 --> 35:00.480
Like, what do we want to do here?

35:00.480 --> 35:02.200
And what is the opportunity?

35:02.200 --> 35:03.880
What are we missing out?

35:03.880 --> 35:06.760
Is he aware that he's using up all the airspace?

35:06.760 --> 35:11.780
Like all these things, but we have to be on the same page about what we value, what those

35:11.780 --> 35:14.160
behaviors look like.

35:14.160 --> 35:20.600
And like those unwritten rules, we also kind of need to make them explicit, especially

35:20.600 --> 35:23.600
in international environments.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.520
Yeah.

35:26.520 --> 35:33.960
So when you say the unwritten rules, does this concept of remote first play into that?

35:33.960 --> 35:37.000
Because for me, that is kind of important.

35:37.000 --> 35:44.440
Like I think Mozilla, I keep going back to Mozilla because it's just something I know

35:44.440 --> 35:45.440
really well.

35:45.440 --> 35:50.600
I think they started out as a remote first company, but have become a remote friendly

35:50.600 --> 35:51.600
company.

35:51.600 --> 35:55.400
And there's a distinct difference between the two.

35:55.400 --> 35:58.760
And I always try to think remote first.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.640
And one of the things is always try to think who's not in the room and how you can include

36:02.640 --> 36:04.480
them.

36:04.480 --> 36:09.760
So does that play into this idea of the unwritten rules to actually write down the unwritten

36:09.760 --> 36:14.560
rules?

36:14.560 --> 36:17.840
I think writing them down can be helpful.

36:17.840 --> 36:22.400
It's always a little awkward at first because people are like, I don't know.

36:22.400 --> 36:30.700
But if you tease out or ask, people know what they are.

36:30.700 --> 36:36.160
And it's kind of cool working with a group where people start to trust and like start

36:36.160 --> 36:40.440
to say the things that we all know that are true, but we don't say out loud.

36:40.440 --> 36:43.240
I think that's really powerful.

36:43.240 --> 36:47.800
For me, like the last couple of years have been really interesting with the pandemic

36:47.800 --> 36:53.720
and how we've adopted to work.

36:53.720 --> 37:01.680
I think for me, if it's remote first or remote friendly, I think it's important that we're

37:01.680 --> 37:07.920
using the label that's in alignment with what's actually happening.

37:07.920 --> 37:13.520
And I think this is a DEI thing as well, because all companies will say on their careers page,

37:13.520 --> 37:16.160
you know, DEI is part of our DNA.

37:16.160 --> 37:19.720
It's like, well, what does that mean for you?

37:19.720 --> 37:22.720
Like what does that concretely look like?

37:22.720 --> 37:25.080
Show me the receipts.

37:25.080 --> 37:30.000
So if a company says they are remote first, like, I'm curious, like, what does that mean

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
for them?

37:31.000 --> 37:33.040
That is a thing.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.040
How do people gather?

37:34.040 --> 37:36.160
And like, who gathers in person?

37:36.160 --> 37:37.160
Who doesn't?

37:37.160 --> 37:38.160
Like, show me the receipts.

37:38.160 --> 37:41.160
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

37:41.160 --> 37:44.400
Yeah, because I mean, I'm struggling with that myself.

37:44.400 --> 37:54.320
Like, I say that I want to do whatever I create, whether it be the company that I'm sort of

37:54.320 --> 38:00.800
kind of building or the community or, you know, whatever it may be.

38:00.800 --> 38:07.960
I do believe in the concept, but at the same time, I'm struggling to really define it.

38:07.960 --> 38:13.040
I sit in front of a page and think I'm going to write about remote first and what it is.

38:13.040 --> 38:16.220
And I really find it hard to nail it down.

38:16.220 --> 38:21.120
And then I start searching online to try and find, like, who are the companies that really

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
do this well?

38:22.120 --> 38:23.840
Ah, I've heard about Automatic.

38:23.840 --> 38:28.980
They seem to be doing it really well, but I can't really find anywhere where even somebody

38:28.980 --> 38:32.600
like Matt Muldenweg has really defined what that really is.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.360
Like here is the 10 things.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.120
And I think maybe that's part of the problem.

38:38.120 --> 38:43.800
Maybe we always want a list of things.

38:43.800 --> 38:48.880
And I don't think it's always that cut and dry that you can just list it.

38:48.880 --> 38:53.800
It's more a feeling.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.840
You can feel when a company is remote first.

38:56.840 --> 39:03.360
Certain things just happen naturally without having to necessarily mandate anything.

39:03.360 --> 39:06.600
And therefore, nobody really sits down.

39:06.600 --> 39:11.360
So I think that plays to the unwritten rules that you've mentioned.

39:11.360 --> 39:16.600
It's unwritten rules that you've never really thought to write down because it doesn't feel

39:16.600 --> 39:18.400
like it needs to be written down.

39:18.400 --> 39:23.840
It almost feels like it's you just know that that's how things are done.

39:23.840 --> 39:32.400
So yeah, but I'm thinking of the ideas toolkit here, like maybe that one of the mindset pieces

39:32.400 --> 39:34.840
and like, what are the tactical things like?

39:34.840 --> 39:38.640
So what is the mindset of being remote first?

39:38.640 --> 39:46.000
And tactically, what does that look like with the real world constraints of time zones,

39:46.000 --> 39:53.800
work life balance, load shedding and rolling blackouts?

39:53.800 --> 39:59.720
Like all of the myriad of ways that we work and prefer to work and like to work.

39:59.720 --> 40:04.480
And what does that mean for accessibility?

40:04.480 --> 40:11.760
I don't know how often you work with developers and web developers, maybe even specifically,

40:11.760 --> 40:19.600
but as they enter this world, and some people are literally young folks in their early 20s

40:19.600 --> 40:25.160
that's like just doing this, some are people in their 50s, some are in between deciding

40:25.160 --> 40:29.280
that the career that they they've been doing, and I think that that's happened a lot in

40:29.280 --> 40:33.560
the last two years where people have like realized that I don't want to go back to the

40:33.560 --> 40:37.920
job I had before this pandemic, because I really was unhappy.

40:37.920 --> 40:44.240
And some of it is out of fear, because people fear that they will lose their jobs to robots.

40:44.240 --> 40:47.040
Whether that's justified or not is a completely separate topic.

40:47.040 --> 40:51.400
But you can't, like I say, you can't argue with somebody's experience.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.140
You can argue with an opinion, but you can't argue with somebody's experience.

40:55.140 --> 40:59.840
So if you experience fear, and you want to do something, and you've decided that what

40:59.840 --> 41:03.480
you're going to do is you're going to learn how to code, and you're going to get into

41:03.480 --> 41:04.480
this industry.

41:04.480 --> 41:10.560
Like, what are the things that that advice that you would give them from a from a DNI,

41:10.560 --> 41:13.600
like fulfilling life perspective?

41:13.600 --> 41:23.360
This is more from a coaching perspective, I think, especially for people like, actually

41:23.360 --> 41:29.680
for anyone, and whether they're new, or you've been doing this for 20 years, like, there's

41:29.680 --> 41:34.960
something really honest about writing down your goals, your professional development

41:34.960 --> 41:40.840
goals, your goals, where you want to take a stand for DEI, writing them down, like,

41:40.840 --> 41:44.760
there's something for me about putting something down on paper, where I can step back and look

41:44.760 --> 41:45.760
at it.

41:45.760 --> 41:50.560
And I can also pull it out in the future and be like, I said this was important to me.

41:50.560 --> 41:54.120
How am I doing there?

41:54.120 --> 41:59.320
So thinking about where you want to develop and how you wanted to develop, not just like

41:59.320 --> 42:03.740
on the technical skills, but like, what are the soft skills or the interpersonal skills

42:03.740 --> 42:06.840
or the collaboration skills you want to build?

42:06.840 --> 42:12.800
Like if you say you want to help new people bridge into open source, what are you doing?

42:12.800 --> 42:17.680
Like what's the plan for the next year, six months, three months?

42:17.680 --> 42:18.680
What are you doing this month?

42:18.680 --> 42:20.460
What are you doing this week?

42:20.460 --> 42:25.480
So taking those bigger goals and breaking them down into smaller chunks, and then building

42:25.480 --> 42:35.680
in accountability, either with your manager, with your trusted friend, with community members.

42:35.680 --> 42:41.420
And you know, you can always drop things off there, but having some rigor to your own development

42:41.420 --> 42:45.720
and investing in how you're growing your skills is super important.

42:45.720 --> 42:49.880
And I think also bringing that to like, how do you want to take a stand for DEI?

42:49.880 --> 42:57.040
And what are you doing to make your workplace or software community more inclusive?

42:57.040 --> 42:59.600
Like write it down.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.600
Set a measurable goal.

43:00.600 --> 43:01.600
Are you doing it?

43:01.600 --> 43:02.600
Yeah.

43:02.600 --> 43:03.600
Yeah.

43:03.600 --> 43:04.600
I know.

43:04.600 --> 43:11.280
Also, I think like if you're learning new things, for me, I'm an extroverted thinker,

43:11.280 --> 43:16.080
but there's also an accountability and learning with other people.

43:16.080 --> 43:22.240
It's cool to like, where I'm stronger on a skill and can help someone who's maybe stuck

43:22.240 --> 43:29.320
and then receive that help on a different skill, like we learn better together, like

43:29.320 --> 43:34.640
so finding those people where you can help each other get unstuck on a technical problem.

43:34.640 --> 43:41.040
But I think there's also another piece where like we're humaning together, like we're learning,

43:41.040 --> 43:45.400
we're getting stuck, we're helping, we're receiving help, we're supporting each other.

43:45.400 --> 43:50.640
Like for me, that's the real strength and where we can do powerful things.

43:50.640 --> 43:51.640
So find your people.

43:51.640 --> 43:52.640
Yeah, that's very true.

43:52.640 --> 43:57.880
I mean, I'm experiencing that, but I think maybe it's gotten worse over the last couple

43:57.880 --> 44:04.160
of years because before the pandemic and all of this, there would be times when I would

44:04.160 --> 44:08.600
get together with other colleagues and we will have an in-person thing and like that

44:08.600 --> 44:12.360
hasn't happened for three years or so now.

44:12.360 --> 44:16.040
And I'm definitely starting to feel that.

44:16.040 --> 44:21.880
I'm starting to feel the fact that I've been remote for a long, long time and really remote

44:21.880 --> 44:25.600
if you want to call it that, the last three years.

44:25.600 --> 44:35.200
And I do miss that in-person almost collaboration, but even if it's just being on a video call

44:35.200 --> 44:40.920
together with somebody else and like working together on a thing, like talking through

44:40.920 --> 44:45.640
a problem, I think like, even if you're the mentor and you're just talking through a code

44:45.640 --> 44:54.280
problem with somebody, I think it's great to have that human connection and that like

44:54.280 --> 44:56.960
feeling that, oh no, yeah, you're getting it.

44:56.960 --> 44:57.960
You're getting it.

44:57.960 --> 44:58.960
You're almost there.

44:58.960 --> 44:59.960
And like, yeah, that's it.

44:59.960 --> 45:00.960
You got it.

45:00.960 --> 45:04.280
And sometimes it helps you also think through the problem that you haven't thought through

45:04.280 --> 45:07.520
for a while and you actually think of better ways of doing things.

45:07.520 --> 45:13.000
And just that collaboration, that like bouncing ideas of each other and stuff like that, I

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
miss that.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.920
And I think it's going to be something that's going to be tricky for us to solve as the

45:17.920 --> 45:25.840
world becomes more and more remote and as people seem to almost retreat more into themselves.

45:25.840 --> 45:31.040
I think some people have concern about the idea of virtual reality becoming like something

45:31.040 --> 45:37.840
where people really withdraw and completely withdraw into that superficial world and what

45:37.840 --> 45:39.320
the impact of that would be.

45:39.320 --> 45:44.120
And I think we kind of had a little bit of a taste of that the last three years and I'm

45:44.120 --> 45:47.720
not so sure that people have handled it really well if they're being honest with themselves.

45:47.720 --> 45:53.880
I think it had a massive mental health impact in a lot of people that they are only now

45:53.880 --> 45:54.880
discovering.

45:54.880 --> 45:55.880
Like for me.

45:55.880 --> 46:02.880
Yes, and I became really close to my neighbor by playing Fortnite with her.

46:02.880 --> 46:10.320
Not virtual reality, but like video game and we would, you know, she's very good at the

46:10.320 --> 46:11.320
game.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.360
So I got to I got doing something with someone who's something much better than you, it's

46:14.360 --> 46:16.240
something I learned a lot faster.

46:16.240 --> 46:21.840
But we would also just talk about like what what we were proud of that day or like what

46:21.840 --> 46:27.760
we were cooking for dinner or like witness other like hard things that we were each going

46:27.760 --> 46:28.760
through.

46:28.760 --> 46:29.760
So both.

46:29.760 --> 46:30.760
I think.

46:30.760 --> 46:34.680
Yeah, I think that's the thing.

46:34.680 --> 46:39.120
It's being able to connect because oftentimes, like you said, you connect over this one thing,

46:39.120 --> 46:43.720
but it leads to other conversations that you actually find meaningful.

46:43.720 --> 46:46.280
Yeah, it's interesting.

46:46.280 --> 46:50.880
And I mean, I do I'm not anti all these other things.

46:50.880 --> 46:53.320
I'm not like against VR or anything like that.

46:53.320 --> 47:00.560
I think it has its place, but I think we do we do need to be mindful of how we use this

47:00.560 --> 47:03.360
and how we approach it, that it doesn't become an all consuming thing.

47:03.360 --> 47:08.560
I think a lot of people are talking about the metaverse and about is that the next evolution

47:08.560 --> 47:09.560
of social media?

47:09.560 --> 47:14.720
And it's going to be our downfall, so to speak, because I'm rolling my eyes.

47:14.720 --> 47:22.520
Yeah, I know so much about all these things is kind of like, I should probably read more

47:22.520 --> 47:23.520
about it.

47:23.520 --> 47:27.320
So I have a better understanding of what it's all about.

47:27.320 --> 47:32.720
As it seems to have like, just keeps getting more and more momentum, like web three and

47:32.720 --> 47:33.720
the whole idea.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.600
I mean, some of the web three stuff I do find compelling.

47:36.600 --> 47:39.560
I like the idea of decentralization.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.640
I like the idea of owning your own content.

47:41.640 --> 47:48.800
I think it's incredibly important for we've given too much of ourselves away for free

47:48.800 --> 47:49.800
for the longest time.

47:49.800 --> 47:50.840
So I do like that.

47:50.840 --> 47:53.760
But I think there's a lot of craft going on around that.

47:53.760 --> 47:57.640
That's just toys, sometimes feels like toys for rich people.

47:57.640 --> 48:03.320
And I don't know what what it's really going to solve, what it's addressing and what it's

48:03.320 --> 48:06.300
trying to make better.

48:06.300 --> 48:10.000
And so that is a slight concern that I have with some of these things.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.440
But I do think that I need to understand it better, because I can't you can't criticize

48:14.440 --> 48:16.400
something if you don't understand it, right?

48:16.400 --> 48:20.720
You need to at least give it a chance and say, what is this all about?

48:20.720 --> 48:25.520
And then maybe you'll find out that there's just a bunch of a minority of loud voices

48:25.520 --> 48:30.560
that is that is making some things make it seem like it's something it's not.

48:30.560 --> 48:36.320
And if you actually dig into the real deal of what what people actually mean when they

48:36.320 --> 48:39.560
talk about web three, then maybe it is a good thing.

48:39.560 --> 48:43.240
Maybe it is something we need to move towards and embrace.

48:43.240 --> 48:51.840
Yeah, so I can keep going for for a while, but I think this was really like delightful

48:51.840 --> 48:53.800
and interesting.

48:53.800 --> 48:58.240
It's really nice to see you and also talk about like things that we both really care

48:58.240 --> 49:01.640
about and some some big ideas like this.

49:01.640 --> 49:03.200
This conversation has really filled me up.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.200
Thank you.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.200
Yeah, no, thank you very much.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.200
This is really good.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.680
It was everything I hoped it would be.

49:07.680 --> 49:08.680
So that's great.

49:08.680 --> 49:09.680
Me too.

49:09.680 --> 49:10.680
Thanks so much, Dora.

49:10.680 --> 49:14.680
I hope you have a lovely day and I hope you can chat again.

49:14.680 --> 49:16.680
That would be really good.

49:16.680 --> 49:17.680
Yeah.

49:17.680 --> 49:22.040
And like ping me on the Slack or email me like if there's anything I could ever do to

49:22.040 --> 49:28.880
support you or help you like we are in community and I truly believe like like we're connected

49:28.880 --> 49:30.440
and we can do big things together.

49:30.440 --> 49:31.440
So yeah.

49:31.440 --> 49:32.440
Yeah.

49:32.440 --> 49:33.440
Yeah.

49:33.440 --> 49:34.440

49:34.440 --> 49:35.440
