Welcome to the Marsilian Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,320
Hey, welcome, Matthew, and welcome to the Marsilian Network Podcast.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
Thank you so much, Skalk.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,600
Thanks again for the invitation and thanks for the opportunity to share a little bit

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,520
of my journey with your audience.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,120
Yeah, no, it's my pleasure.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,960
So let's jump right into it.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,320
Let's start off with you telling us more about who is Matthew and what do you do and, yeah,

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
all about you.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,920
So I will start off by sharing, like, this is a question that used to scare me and make

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,560
me nervous a little bit.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,020
As you will quickly learn, I have had quite a circuitous career path.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,560
So I tell people I'm on about my seventh major career change, and whereas before I would

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,560
be told to, like, hide parts of my story and journey, now I feel like I'm kind of living

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,400
a life where I can own the full journey and see kind of the meaning and purpose in each

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,800
step of it.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,880
But I will give a slightly abbreviated version of the steps, but I tell people I started

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,440
my career very intentionally.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,800
In school, I was a civil and environmental engineering major, and my intention was to

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:42,240
kind of use environmental engineering as a kind of platform to make change in the world.

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
And quickly, I discovered a couple of things.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:55,680
I wasn't a very good engineer, and it so happened that I had a positive aptitude for technology,

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,020
and I credit my employer at the time because they were like, hey, you seem to be struggling

25
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,600
in some of your fieldwork, but we see you have this kind of aptitude for technology.

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,300
Like would you consider supporting, you know, our head of technology in kind of supporting

27
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
the office?

28
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,980
And I was like, sure, I was interested in it, I was passionate about it.

29
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,680
So that was first, like, career change number one was from environmental engineer to IT

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,880
support person and network administrator.

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,360
And I quickly learned it was work I loved to do.

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,340
And like I said, I was kind of naturally good at it and interested in it.

33
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,760
So after that role ended, I actually went into the world to see if I could find, you

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
know, an IT support job.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,360
And after a lot of reflection, that was the last time I like looked for a job in a traditional

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,960
like sending cover letters and resumes out kind of a way.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,820
And that was in 1999.

38
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,960
And I went to job fairs, and I sent out a bunch of resumes, and I got a job with a small

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,720
IT consulting company.

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,360
And my first project was desktop support in a hospital and was responsible for, you know,

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,360
just supporting all of their users.

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,440
And as you will hear my story, there's a lot of alignment to major things in the world.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,440
So on New Year's Eve of 1999, I was working desktop support in a hospital.

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,080
So like, at 1159, I was in the hospital with a team like waiting for the world to collapse

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,680
and all the hospital machines to go down, you know, when the clock struck midnight.

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,680
And that did not happen, you know, but at 1201, the hospital was fine.

47
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,600
This is the like systems were all fine.

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,520
But shortly after the company, the consulting company I was working for had an opportunity

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:07,680
in Boston to support this up and coming internet holding company called Internet Capital Group.

50
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,800
And I was the youngest person on the team, not the most qualified.

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,000
And they were like, would you consider moving to Boston to support this company that's kind

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,680
of in this massive state of growth?

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,240
And I was like, sure, like I was 20 nothing and I was like, seems like a great opportunity.

54
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
And I'll never forget, I went up there to interview with at the time, that's kind of small team

55
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,720
of senior executives.

56
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,920
And I remember the office manager saying to me like, I don't need you to be like a brilliant

57
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,360
technologist.

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,440
I need you to be able to communicate with our people in a like thoughtful and transparent

59
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,640
way.

60
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:54,120
And so within a week or two, I packed up my bags and I moved to Boston and I started supporting

61
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,840
this company that grew out of a very small office space over the course of about 12 months

62
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,040
into a 20,000 square foot office space that I helped with everything from finding the

63
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,680
space to ordering the furniture to building it out to helping build the technology network.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,760
And it was just an awesome project.

65
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,840
I was given a lot of responsibility and I just I love so much about it.

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,760
And this is kind of alignment with world affairs.

67
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,640
That was the first bubble burst.

68
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,240
So within a period of about 12 months, we moved into this office, we invested all of

69
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,060
this money into this office just to have to shut it down.

70
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,840
So within a few months, we were subleasing the space and the furniture we were they were

71
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,720
laying off most of the staff.

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,120
My last kind of job there was to set up the last five people in home offices.

73
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,880
And at that point, so that this is kind of a next big transition.

74
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,360
My company didn't have any other work for me in Boston.

75
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,880
And I didn't want to move back.

76
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,680
I'd only been there like a year and a half.

77
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,160
So this is my I tell people this is my first negotiated separation.

78
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,000
I was like, I still want to do this work.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,160
Like, I'm in contract with you.

80
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,400
I can't work for any clients like would you be considering to waive that?

81
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,600
This company still has a little bit of work for me.

82
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,920
There's some other projects up here they'd like me to do.

83
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:31,440
So they accepted my proposal and that was my first kind of foray into working for myself.

84
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,560
So I had a couple of clients and in Boston and then I picked up another one in New York

85
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,320
who is a friend who owned a brokerage on the American Stock Exchange.

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,760
And so I was helping him with some technology and operations stuff.

87
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,280
And he one day he was like, listen, why don't you just move to New York?

88
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,800
I will teach you this business.

89
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,520
You can be our in-house technology and operations person.

90
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,520
And again, and this is a theme you will see like I was doing a lot of reacting at this

91
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,320
point in my career.

92
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,200
Like I didn't really have a vision that I was like, oh, this is the thing I want to

93
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
do.

94
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I was like, oh, look, opportunity.

95
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,160
I'll just follow this thing.

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,840
So I moved up to New York.

97
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,520
I kind of took the job.

98
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,800
I signed my lease on the Friday before September 11th.

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
And September 11th happened and both my boss and my landlord were like, listen, if you

100
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,480
don't want to come now, we understand.

101
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,800
But I was already packed.

102
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,600
I was like, I'm committed to this move.

103
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:41,520
And so on October 1st of 2001, I started at the American Stock Exchange and it was an

104
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,800
unnerving period.

105
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,560
I mean, the stock exchange was only a couple blocks south of ground zero.

106
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,960
A lot of people down there had lost people in their firms, their friends, family members.

107
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,720
But yeah, so that was another big transition.

108
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:08,320
And I tell people I learned very early in that job that the environment was not necessarily

109
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,960
in alignment with my values.

110
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:19,160
And the story I share, Skulk, is I would go into, within three months, I was on a seat,

111
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,840
which meant I was a broker that would run into all the crowds.

112
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,560
And I would run in and I would ask for a quote or place an order and I would always say please

113
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
and thank you.

114
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,740
And I will never forget someone said to me, you must be new here.

115
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,160
No one says please and thank you.

116
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,800
So for an environment to so clearly state, it's not civil here.

117
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,140
And that within a few years, it really took a toll on me from a stress perspective.

118
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,720
It was very, very intense.

119
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,960
And my boss was a dear friend and he underlined the fact and this is another crystallized

120
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
moment in my head.

121
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,080
He was like, the people here will screw you for one penny.

122
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
No one here is your friend.

123
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,100
And that was just one of those things where you're like, you don't want to believe it,

124
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,360
but you see enough of it and it was kind of like, I need to get out of here.

125
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,240
So that was my second negotiated separation.

126
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,500
I said, I need to transition into something a little bit more fulfilling for me.

127
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,680
It was at a time where that business was changing because of technology.

128
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,400
So he was also happy.

129
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,280
So negotiated a three month kind of transition and I said, listen, I will be on call for

130
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,540
these three months.

131
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:46,280
So if you need anything, you can always call me, but I'm going to look for a new job.

132
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,320
This is an important transition because this was the first time I was like, all right,

133
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,720
if I want to define kind of a personal mission for this next phase of my career, what will

134
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,880
that be?

135
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,600
And where I landed was like, so I had this technology experience, now I have this financial

136
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,640
services experience.

137
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,960
I said, I want to help make the global markets more efficient.

138
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,740
And in retrospect, it was like, it was a good mission statement.

139
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,840
It wasn't necessarily like a real purposeful one.

140
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,800
Like, it will come as no surprise, like I saw opportunity to make a lot of money in

141
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,000
that field and this seemed like a mission that like I could find something that at least

142
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,480
allowed me to take advantage of my strengths and kind of the intersection of these things

143
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,080
where I was interested.

144
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,400
And I will say this has informed a lot of our process at Career Edge.

145
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,880
So what I did in that moment was I said, I like technology, I like financial services,

146
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,520
there's a lot of people that work in this space.

147
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,800
So I talked to people that worked at stock exchanges, I talked to people that worked

148
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,320
like in the banks and other financial institutions that were present there.

149
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
I talked to software companies, there were a lot of software companies at that time that

150
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,720
were growing quickly and moving into the space.

151
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:16,280
And then I talked to consultancies that were helping integrate technology into financial

152
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,280
service institutions.

153
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:26,880
All I did during those three months was make connections with people at all of those industries

154
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,400
to learn about their journeys, learn about their jobs, learn about all of the things

155
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,920
that helped them be successful in their roles.

156
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,000
And where I ended up landing was the consulting space seems like a great opportunity for me

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,880
to work for a lot of different clients at this intersection.

158
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,160
This is another important story I share with people.

159
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,240
So I had a friend who worked at Accenture, a big global consultancy, I told him what

160
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,240
I was looking for.

161
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,520
He said, we are really looking for people at this intersection of technology and financial

162
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
services.

163
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll send you the link to apply for this role.

164
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,440
I was like, great.

165
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
So I applied.

166
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,600
And then a couple of days I get the stock, sorry, we're not interested.

167
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,560
Your skills do not align to our needs.

168
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,080
And I forwarded along to my friend and I said, thank you so much for the support, but it

169
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,360
looks like I'm not a fit.

170
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,360
And I share this story because it just goes to show you like this system doesn't always

171
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,520
work as designed.

172
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,000
Because when he got that email, he flipped out.

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,760
He forwarded it to the head of financial services at Accenture and he forwarded to the head

174
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,600
of human resources and he said, you've been telling me how badly we need people at the

175
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,640
intersection of technology and financial services.

176
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:56,640
I just gave you this perfect candidate and you just denied them even an initial conversation.

177
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,960
And then I very quickly got a call from HR, I very quickly got scheduled for 10 of a series

178
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
of interviews.

179
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,880
And anyway, long story short, a month or two later, I got a job at Accenture and it was

180
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
perfect.

181
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,760
This project was a new order management system for the New York Stock Exchange.

182
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,440
So I was able to for the first time to like articulate a vision and actually find an opportunity

183
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,680
that met that vision.

184
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,160
And this is where I will fast forward a little.

185
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,080
So I spent seven years there, I got to work on great projects around the world.

186
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:39,400
But in late 2012, I was working on a compliance project at a big bank in New York and I woke

187
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,080
up one morning and there was an email from the managing director who I was working for

188
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,120
and it said, your aggression is not going unnoticed.

189
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,760
And I read below and in the middle of the night, I had sent some scathing email to some

190
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,880
poor project manager because their status report wasn't right.

191
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,960
And I was like, I have now compromised my values and need to really kind of reflect

192
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,680
and make a more intentional transition.

193
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,160
So I kind of negotiated a, you know, essentially a transition of my role.

194
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,080
I took a six month leave of absence and Accenture was great.

195
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,160
They said you can come back and have your same job.

196
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,680
You can come back and do something different on the other side of the world or, you know,

197
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,660
if you don't want to come back, we'll kind of share going recommendations for you.

198
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,040
So after like taking two months to just completely decompress, I did another like exploration.

199
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,200
I talked to people in and around areas of interest to me.

200
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,300
And at the time, I just wanted to do something with more of an impact on the world.

201
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,920
So fast forward, I was kind of like, I have all of this knowledge around strategy and

202
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
operations.

203
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,440
I just would like to use it for more intentional causes.

204
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:04,120
So I worked for a bunch of nonprofits, social enterprises and startups in and around kind

205
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,360
of Philadelphia.

206
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,960
And again, I was working for myself.

207
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,040
I was creating these consulting opportunities.

208
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,540
And after a couple of years of doing that, one of my clients said, you know, I need you

209
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,380
all in or out.

210
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:24,580
And it was an opportunity to work in social impact real estate to really make a meaningful

211
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,120
change in a couple of underserved communities in Philadelphia.

212
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,040
So I went all in on that.

213
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,640
And I spent five years there.

214
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,280
And the biggest lesson learned from that part of the story is even the thing you think sounds

215
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:46,920
perfect and aligned to the vision that you have for yourself may not be what you expect

216
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
it to be.

217
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,720
And you know, what I mean by that is like, this was another thing that I never tested

218
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,400
what it was like to be in real estate.

219
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,240
I was so excited by the vision.

220
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,640
I didn't like take a take a moment to be like, hey, what's it going to be like when people

221
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,080
are calling you at three o'clock in the morning to tell you there's a leak in the building

222
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,320
or somebody has like.

223
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,640
So great experience.

224
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
I learned a lot.

225
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:17,080
But then at the end of 2020, I was like, this is this is not the way that most suits me

226
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,240
to create the impact I want to make.

227
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,360
And so again, I transitioned and I negotiated a separation.

228
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,160
I said, I'll step down my time.

229
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,280
We actually kind of co-created some consulting engagements for me, and the company was fine

230
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,280
to let me take those on my own.

231
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:42,360
And then during that time, I really started to reflect again and say, what is at this

232
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,320
intersection of the impact I want to create?

233
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,200
And also the work that really kind of energizes me.

234
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,920
And that that kind of spawned the start of career edge.

235
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,360
And my younger brother and I started it just by interviewing 80 people about their jobs

236
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,320
and what was working for them and what wasn't.

237
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,280
And we are still very much a work in progress, but the majority of my days today are spent

238
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,820
helping people find more fulfillment in their in their professional lives.

239
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,880
And I tell people it's taken me 46 years to get here.

240
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,000
But now I finally like wake up every morning and and realize like this is what I was meant

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
to be doing.

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,040
So I realize it's a very long story, but it's important.

243
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Like I said.

244
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
That's great.

245
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Yeah.

246
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
No, that's great.

247
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
That is lovely.

248
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,360
That's so many turns that that life took.

249
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,440
And I mean, I can I can associate with that.

250
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:51,280
I've also been from a musician to classical guitarist to a tech person to working in corporate

251
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,920
to not fitting at all.

252
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,080
And eventually like ending up doing my own thing and finding that caring about other

253
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,920
people is what I really want to do.

254
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,080
And so try to find where that's like what led to some of these things like the community

255
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
that I started.

256
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,640
There's these podcasts and all of that stuff.

257
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,400
And I hear some of the same undertones in your story a lot, a lot of change, but change

258
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,520
into the direction of where people's journey is important.

259
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,560
Having impact that is meaningful is is important to you.

260
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:32,920
And you brought up a career itch from I hope I said that correctly.

261
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,200
And the work that you do there.

262
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,840
And I think on your LinkedIn page, there's this one liner that is I hope people find

263
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,440
professional peace and create a future they proud of.

264
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,400
I mean, who doesn't want that?

265
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:52,800
So if somebody comes to you and they say, I don't know, I'm at one of these points,

266
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,840
these inflection points in my life, and I have this opportunity to rethink my career

267
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,680
and rethink what I do.

268
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,520
How would you go about helping them to find professional peace and create a future they

269
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,920
can be proud of?

270
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Great question, Scott.

271
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,960
I think the thing that I have realized, and again, this has even been an evolution for

272
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:24,960
me is I think it is so important to start from a place of exploring how you feel currently

273
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,120
and how you want to feel.

274
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,640
My corporate and professional training was always so focused on like tangible and specific

275
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,800
like strategic financial operational goals.

276
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,680
We were never, you know, feeling was never a metric, right?

277
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,120
Like no one ever said, hey, how do you feel?

278
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,760
And how do you want to feel?

279
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,800
And the thing that I've learned, and I've learned this even with my own life and on

280
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:02,360
my own journey, like starting from that place of like exploring what you're feeling now

281
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,880
and the source of those feelings, and then like really starting to ground yourself in

282
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,480
the positive feelings you want to feel, and the reality is, and I have seen this over

283
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,120
and over again with people that I've spoken with.

284
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:29,160
If you've had difficult and challenging professional experiences, they actually are stronger than

285
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,680
the positive ones.

286
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,840
So I've had to reconnect people to positive experiences because they've forgotten them

287
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:44,560
because of the current like, you know, work stress or work challenge they're having.

288
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,360
So that's usually where we start.

289
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,880
Like how are you feeling, like what's coming up for you, and how do you want to feel, and

290
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,760
have you felt the way you want to feel before?

291
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,880
And most people can answer that question positively, right?

292
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,480
Like even regardless of what the memory is, personal or professional, they can say, I

293
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:11,000
have felt at peace or I have felt alive or I have felt energized doing these things.

294
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,760
So that's the thing that like I always start by connecting, reconnecting people to that.

295
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,880
And I will say I've noticed this in my own life as well.

296
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,280
Like that has some of the biggest downstream effect as it relates to like personal and

297
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,800
professional like fulfillment and success, is that how do I want to feel and letting

298
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,080
that kind of be a bit of a north star?

299
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,320
And I think you alluded to this.

300
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,080
I think that the next thing in another part of this process is like, what are the questions

301
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,400
or the prompts to get people thinking more about those things that kind of energize them

302
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
or that make them feel purposeful?

303
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,800
So questions like, hey, what problems in the world are you interested in solving or helping

304
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,640
to solve?

305
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,920
Where in the world would you like to make a meaningful impact?

306
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:19,720
Specifically, what people in the world would you like to help or support or make successful?

307
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,600
So the next thing is really exploring some of those questions around purpose and whether

308
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,760
you've been asked them or not, like there's usually something inside you intuitively that

309
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,640
is like, yeah, these are the things that are important to me.

310
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,840
These are the things I care about.

311
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,800
And again, if we are playing the traditional job searching game, we're not starting from

312
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,640
that place, right?

313
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,280
We're starting from a place of finding a thing that fits our skills.

314
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,440
We're not starting from a place of, hey, what can I connect to that's real purposeful?

315
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,760
And what value can I create in those spaces?

316
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:06,400
So I would say those are the two things I think that really start like a healthier waterfall

317
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,360
that focus on feelings and that focus on kind of purpose exploration.

318
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Yeah, that is wonderful.

319
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,560
I think there's a really, I think a lot of people will find that useful to hear because

320
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,840
I agree.

321
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:28,760
We often start with looking at job boards from a skills perspective instead of from

322
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,840
a culture perspective or from a, what does this company stand for?

323
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,400
What are they trying to accomplish in the world and does it fit with what I'm doing?

324
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,320
Because I mean, most job postings don't even talk about that really.

325
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,400
They're more about like this long list of skills that you need, which most of the time

326
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,560
is completely unreasonable by itself, but the focus is heavily on the skills, not so

327
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:03,840
much on this is how you would have an impact in the company if you do pursue this role.

328
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,440
And this is the overarching goal of the company.

329
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,520
So if you take this role, your technical skills or whatever will contribute to the company

330
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,440
in this way, which will contribute to our end goal in this way.

331
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,860
So I think that's a much more healthier, much more long-term way to think about these things.

332
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:31,760
But irrespective of whether you are on your own journey, doing your own thing or working

333
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,120
for an employer, there are times in the day or in the week or in the month or in the year

334
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,840
where it just feels like, I need something.

335
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,960
I need somebody to tell me this is all going to be okay.

336
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,360
And you do this thing called the Monday Pit Talk.

337
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,000
That's how I learned about you.

338
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,880
One of these was shared by one of the folks from Groove on the Groove community Slack.

339
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,160
And I checked that out and I was like, this is so cool.

340
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,960
So how did you come about this idea and where do you or how do you come up with the topics

341
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,360
that you discuss in these pit talks?

342
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,640
Well, thank you, Skulk.

343
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,880
I appreciate the kind and supportive words.

344
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
It's funny.

345
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,600
So it started early days in the pandemic, you know, when we were going very quickly

346
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,480
from in person to like virtual meetings and video calls all day.

347
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,680
I learned a couple of things early on.

348
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:36,640
Everybody, despite what they were going through kind of emotionally, they got peace from just

349
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,200
having like a smiling and supportive face on the other side of the camera.

350
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,840
And I like specifically remember people saying to me like, thank you.

351
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,360
Like I feel comfortable like in this space that doesn't feel comfortable.

352
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,520
And this falls into the category of like a lot of my life was I felt I lived without

353
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,520
an awareness or like I wasn't paying attention.

354
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,360
And I felt like I was at a point where I was paying attention and like it started to come

355
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
up more and more.

356
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,080
And I was like, all right, so this is an interesting data point.

357
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,440
Like let's hold on to this.

358
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,960
And then the other thing that really started to become fascinating to me was in a lot of

359
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,640
those interviews where I was just kind of hearing people's journeys and stories and

360
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:36,120
offering, you know, a new or a different perspective, sometimes all people needed was a different

361
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,680
perspective, right, especially in things that like they were consumed with, right.

362
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,480
And like for whatever reason, like, we're so focused that they weren't kind of seeing

363
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,560
other perspectives and opportunities.

364
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,720
So I was realizing in a lot of these interactions that just by sharing a story or a perspective

365
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,120
or like a helpful thing that had helped me was enough to at least kind of trigger, oh,

366
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
that feels different.

367
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,680
That may be something I can try.

368
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,520
So you know, it obviously took me like the better part of a, you know, nine months to

369
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,640
a year after I had those kind of couple of realizations to formulate what is now the

370
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,280
Monday morning pep talk.

371
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:24,080
But yeah, so I ended up doing 30 of them last year and it just felt good, quite candidly,

372
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:33,920
to like do something, you know, kind of public facing and not be too attached to the outcome.

373
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,100
I was like, I want to do this because I want to get this message out there.

374
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,720
And like, I can obsess over everything from like production value to low.

375
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,200
And I'm like, I just want to share this and so yeah, that's kind of how it started.

376
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,080
And I will say I reflected on a lot of it last year.

377
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:57,000
And in going into this year, I'm doing things a little bit differently.

378
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,640
One of the things I realized I did last year a lot of in my coaching and in my content

379
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,960
was focused on problems.

380
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,680
And this year, like what the thing that has been coming up a lot for me is like, we're

381
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:21,480
not problems to be fixed, right, like we're the framing that's been helpful for me is

382
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,640
like, we have this like true authentic self, like at the heart of ourselves, that unfortunately

383
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,200
has been covered up by a lot of things, society, right, like our work environments, especially

384
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,640
unhealthy work environments.

385
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,880
So all of these layers over time have like covered up a lot of what is our like real

386
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,480
and true identities.

387
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:50,760
So the shift this year is going to be a little bit more kind of positive focused and really

388
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,760
focused on like, hey, let's actually tap into strengths.

389
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:02,080
Like let's not look at you as a problem to be fixed, you know, or to be solved.

390
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,280
Let's look at like tapping into that kind of truest version and most authentic version

391
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:14,680
of yourself and let that kind of be the guide and not treat like your life is something

392
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,040
to be triaged all the time, if that makes sense.

393
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,000
So I'm still evolving it.

394
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,680
Yeah, that makes complete sense.

395
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Yeah, for sure.

396
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:37,200
I think society has evolved or devolved maybe into this idea that human beings are a collection

397
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,200
of problems that needs to be addressed instead of celebrating maybe sometimes some of these

398
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,380
quote unquote problems.

399
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:53,680
Maybe they are just differences that for some reason has been termed to be problems.

400
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
So yeah, I love that.

401
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
I love that refocusing.

402
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:04,360
And I think there's so much negativity going on in the world that I think of a refocus

403
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,640
on what's good and what's positive is definitely a good call.

404
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,480
So I 100% support that focus change.

405
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:20,440
Speaking about that, so the Mycelium network community was founded around the idea that

406
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,080
I've heard from a lot of early stage web developers specifically.

407
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,760
And this runs the gamut.

408
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,520
It's from like people who are like 16, 17 years old, all the way to people who's in

409
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,720
their 40s and 50s that's just decided like, I want to try something else.

410
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,680
Like, I mean, like you said, and like I mentioned, like, we've had all these career changes during

411
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680
our lifetime.

412
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:51,520
So I don't think this idea of school, university, job, retirement, I think that that whole cycle

413
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:57,760
has been completely broken apart and I don't think it's something that people do anymore.

414
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,780
But you know, and some of these people have decided to do it via starting their own business.

415
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,320
Some people are going for employment.

416
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,360
Maybe they're finding that that company that they can believe in, in the mission and everything

417
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,440
and they want to build a career there.

418
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,400
But the one thing that I've found with all these folks is it's scary, right?

419
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,720
Whether it's your first time going out there in the big wide world trying to find your

420
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,440
place or whether it's having to prove yourself yet again in a new industry.

421
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:39,920
So for people that is doing one of these two ways of getting into a new career, like, what

422
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,920
would you tell them?

423
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,680
How do they, how should they approach this, whether it's starting off or whether it's

424
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,240
even maybe leveling up a little bit in their existing career?

425
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
It's a great question, Skalk.

426
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,280
And this is another one that has like, my thinking of this has evolved over time because,

427
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,640
you know, having some operations background, I always believe like you just created a single

428
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,800
process that worked for everybody, right?

429
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:12,680
Like you just optimize the process for everyone and, you know, to your point, like we are

430
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,280
all unique complex beings, right?

431
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:26,800
And the process I define for you may not serve someone else.

432
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:31,960
So there's a couple of principles that I'm working with now.

433
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:40,000
And the first is really like asking people just the question of like, what would your

434
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,920
job search or career discovery look like if it were fun?

435
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:54,800
Like allowing people to connect to like, if I were to actually turn this into an enjoyable

436
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,120
thing, like what's the process I would create for myself?

437
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,560
Because you alluded to something that I think is so, it limits so much of us.

438
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,880
The system is built the way the system is built, right?

439
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,960
From early education to higher education to corporate hiring, right?

440
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,680
Like it is a series of constants.

441
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,880
And I tell people like, be conscious of the fact that like, the system will always give

442
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,160
you guidance to stay within the system, right?

443
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:32,040
To be successful within the system, right?

444
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:40,320
I think it's very helpful for you to think about like, if I were going to design a process

445
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,520
that really felt fun and energizing for me to find a job, what would that look like?

446
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,920
And that answer will be different for different people, but like, you know, I will give you

447
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:55,200
some examples and some of these are people that I've directly worked with and some are

448
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,480
just anecdotes that I've heard that I just absolutely love.

449
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,440
But like, you know, the person who wants to work for a company and says, you know what

450
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
I'm going to do?

451
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,040
I'm going to understand what their client profile, their ideal client profile is.

452
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,320
I'm going to go get them five clients.

453
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,560
And then I'm going to go reach out to them and say, hey, I got you five clients.

454
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,640
Would you be interested in having a conversation with me about working there?

455
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Right?

456
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,640
And you know, that's a great example.

457
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:32,360
A woman who I worked with, I encourage people to always start from a place of like, you

458
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,000
know, envision a future you without constraints.

459
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,280
Like before you say, I can't do that because I don't have this experience or I can't do

460
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,040
that because I don't have the right network, like envision what is possible without constraints

461
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,280
and then try to learn from people that are already kind of living that life.

462
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,400
Like my favorite thing, you know, my favorite kind of sentiment to share with people is

463
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,640
like there are eight billion people in the world.

464
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,160
There is an excellent chance that there's at least one person that is kind of living

465
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,560
the life, you know, that you want.

466
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,520
And also most likely there is a person that has started from a place very similar to the

467
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,920
place that you're in.

468
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:26,600
And I say that just to say like, you can create any opportunity for yourself that you want.

469
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,560
But once you've done that envisioning, like the most important thing for me has been connect

470
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,880
with people that are doing the work you think you want to do.

471
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:47,720
And for some people that is, you know, people that like building or creating, it's creating

472
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,360
something for someone and saying, hey, I want to share this with you, maybe it'll be helpful

473
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,880
to you in your work, like as a way to connect with that person.

474
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,800
I know other people that like, they just go in with curious mind, like I just want to

475
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:11,040
learn about you, your journey, your goals, your challenges.

476
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,520
And most people are happy to share that, especially, and this is a lesson that I learned the hard

477
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,120
way and you alluded to this a little bit.

478
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:26,920
We start, we usually start from a place of I have to sell myself.

479
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,560
And I tell people, you don't have to sell yourself initially.

480
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:37,720
All you have to do is say, hey, can you, I am trying to understand more about this thing

481
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,240
I think I want to do.

482
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,300
Can you help me to understand the thing better?

483
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,520
And then this is where like, as you develop those relationships, those are the people

484
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,940
that can tell you if you're like, all right, now I'm sure this is what I want to do.

485
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,760
How do I position myself to do this work?

486
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,680
Those people that already have those jobs are the best resource to tell you how to get

487
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,840
them, right?

488
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,440
But you don't have to start from a place of selling.

489
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:12,200
You just have to start from a place of curiosity.

490
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,920
And believe it or not, and this was very helpful for me when I started CareerEdge, like I picked

491
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,800
people that I was like, hey, you represent what I think I want this to be.

492
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,040
And like that helped me start to build the early roadmap of CareerEdge because I could

493
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,000
see the moves that these people were making and how they were making them.

494
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,200
Yeah, that's great.

495
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,560
Yeah, I think that's one of the things that I wanted to do with this whole community,

496
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,240
especially the async kind of like discord server with the community.

497
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,160
And it's still a little bit missing, but there's some folks starting to trickle in now because

498
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,000
I do want people there that is already in this industry or in this career so that people

499
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,240
can talk to them.

500
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,040
And I think people always think I should only ask them technical questions, like I should

501
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,640
only come to them, to my mentor, so to speak, when there's a piece of code that doesn't

502
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:13,800
work or when I don't understand a technical thing where it's like, sure, that's good,

503
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,880
but there's more to it than just the code.

504
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,720
And you should ask about those things too.

505
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,480
It's like, what do you do on a daily basis?

506
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,560
Because a lot of people have a complete misconception of what it is to write code.

507
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,920
People see movies and they see people typing super fast on their keyboards all day.

508
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,320
And it's like, more often than not, that's actually a small part of your day.

509
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,560
There's a lot of engagement with other people.

510
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,720
There's a lot of talking through problems.

511
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,560
There's a lot of being able to see other people's perspectives, other people's points of view

512
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,320
and being able to disagree in a civil manner.

513
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,920
And sometimes also admitting that maybe you were wrong, which is hard.

514
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,520
But we need to be able to do that.

515
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,560
And we need to be able to do that civilly so that it doesn't devolve the relationship

516
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,240
within the company or within your team.

517
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,840
So I think it's important to also talk about those topics.

518
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I think that's right.

519
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:24,040
And I heard a great quote years ago that was, you can't be it if you can't see it.

520
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,320
So if you haven't interacted with those kind of people, if you're not even aware of what

521
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,040
else goes on within your company or with even in your team, you don't even know what questions

522
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,000
to ask.

523
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:46,880
And this is a place where I will say, I have found the fastest way to knowledge is a conversation

524
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,800
with another human being.

525
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:57,600
I spent years poring over articles and the most valuable insights I've gotten are when

526
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,280
I've been face to face or on the phone with somebody and just said, tell me more about

527
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,240
who you are, what you do and how you've been successful.

528
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,720
Yeah, setting the right expectations as well.

529
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,880
Because I think at the moment, there's a lot of good because people are aware that there's

530
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:26,760
this big, well, it's a little different right now at this very moment in tech.

531
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:35,320
But there was a point in the last six months to be here where a lot of places started educating

532
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:41,000
people to get into tech because it was sold as this panacea, this solution to all the

533
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,840
world's problems in terms of employment, in terms of everything.

534
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,440
Now we're in a bit of a precarious situation with all these layoffs happening at these

535
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,880
big, big companies that people have, if you work there, you might have felt a sense of

536
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:05,000
job security and it's incredibly sad and I know people personally who's been affected

537
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,960
by all of this stuff and it's hard, it doesn't matter where you live, it's still extremely

538
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,240
disruptive to be told, sorry, but we're going to have to let you go.

539
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,280
Because it's not something you planned on.

540
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,240
You were coming into the office, doing your thing, you maybe even had plans for the rest

541
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:34,040
of the year of what you'd like to accomplish and all of that is just, it's over, to rethink,

542
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,960
it's time to rethink everything.

543
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,680
So for some people it's worse than others, but I don't think it's easy for anybody when

544
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,360
this happens to you.

545
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:52,040
So I think there's a lot of support needed for these kinds of things, for these people

546
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:59,240
going through this and I'm sure, I haven't brought this topic up yet with the people

547
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:06,080
in the community, but I am sure there's quite a few folks that have put a lot on the line

548
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,920
to change careers that's now maybe thinking that they've made the wrong choice and are

549
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,360
in between a rock and a hard place because they might have given up a job where they

550
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:21,600
had something to do something else only to find that the industry they thought was so

551
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,440
secure and so lucrative is going through a really, really tough time.

552
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,680
And so they might feel like, oh my goodness, what the heck do I do?

553
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,340
So do you have any advice for these people, like how to stay motivated and stay focused

554
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,800
when it might even feel like the world is collapsing around you?

555
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
Yeah.

556
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,120
I mean, my heart goes out to all of those people and every time I see those announcements,

557
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:57,160
my heart sinks a little because I know, especially in places where you're like, I'm secure here,

558
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,700
that quickly things can change and it's interesting.

559
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,320
This is another area where my perspective has changed.

560
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:16,400
The thing that I have learned is we can only control our own actions.

561
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,480
External forces are external forces.

562
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,560
We can't control them.

563
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:31,000
The only thing we can control is how we react to those forces as well as decisions made

564
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,400
in the past are made.

565
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,120
Things that have happened in the past, those things cannot be changed.

566
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:49,320
It is what we do today and tomorrow that we can control how we move differently.

567
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:57,640
So the first thing I will say is, and this has been helpful for me in a lot of my transitions,

568
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,640
you have to grieve the loss of the thing.

569
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,080
You've lost something that's significant, right?

570
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:09,800
Especially something that is the source of your livelihood.

571
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,680
I think one of the things, when I was scared with managing emotions earlier in my life,

572
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:21,640
it would be, what are all the unhealthy ways I can distract myself from this thing?

573
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,060
There was no vice that was too good for me.

574
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:32,800
Whatever I needed to do to suppress the feeling or ignore it or distract myself from it was

575
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:40,680
where I invested my time, whereas the skill that I've really been cultivating more recently

576
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:47,960
when these things come up is to actually feel them all the way through.

577
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,400
I'll give a very specific example.

578
00:44:51,400 --> 00:45:02,400
When I started this most recent round of businesses, it was during COVID.

579
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,600
We had a baby girl in May of 2021.

580
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:15,720
The financial insecurity was not insignificant.

581
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:23,440
One of the things, and my partner and I actually did this activity together, we're like, let's

582
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,480
feel through losing everything.

583
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:33,200
Because the thing that we're afraid of is that you're going to end up at a point where

584
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,600
you can't survive.

585
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,220
We felt through it.

586
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:45,400
We felt through losing our jobs, we felt through losing savings, housing, all of these things.

587
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,920
Yeah, it's hard to feel through all those things, but once you've felt through them,

588
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:57,560
you realize you are so far from that ultimate outcome.

589
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:03,880
Now that you have felt how terrible it could feel, it's not going to go away, but it's

590
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,680
not going to have the same control over you.

591
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,780
You can start to focus on the thing.

592
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,880
We started to focus on the, all right, well, if those things do happen, what are things

593
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,760
that we would do?

594
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,320
What are places we could go and earn money easily?

595
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,840
If we needed to ask for help, if we needed to find less expensive housing.

596
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,760
We did this practical.

597
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,760
What would we do?

598
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,600
Then we were like, okay, that was enough.

599
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:39,280
We grieved it, we strategized around it, but no, now let's focus on the big things we want

600
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,600
to create for our future now.

601
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,920
That's the first thing I'll say.

602
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,680
Don't try to distract from it.

603
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,460
Feel it all the way through.

604
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:57,000
Feel through that worst case scenario so it doesn't have that kind of death grip on you.

605
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,920
Then ask yourself, what can I do with this opportunity?

606
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,520
What can I do with this time?

607
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,200
I've seen so many people, Scott, that have actually taken the time to reconnect to a

608
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:14,880
creative practice or just something that energizes and fulfills them.

609
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,200
I think that is another simple first step.

610
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:26,560
Don't feel the need to jump right into the next thing.

611
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,560
If there is a need for financial security, the thing I always encourage people to do

612
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:39,640
is look at what you need to live and ask yourself, how can I satisfy this for six to 12 months

613
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,920
with the least amount of my time?

614
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:51,960
I can really create space to nurture myself, do more purposeful exploration, and really

615
00:47:51,960 --> 00:48:02,800
find the next thing that's going to energize me and also sustain me financially.

616
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,800
But I know, like I said, I've worked through recessions.

617
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,800
I've been part of downsizing and it's just that it's going to happen and it's nothing

618
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,640
you did.

619
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,720
The thing you have control over is what you do next.

620
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,720
Yeah.

621
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:25,320
I mean, there's the flip side of that coin, which they call survivor's remorse.

622
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:30,360
It's when you're the one that doesn't get let go and you're still at the company because

623
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:40,520
one of the clients that I worked with in mid-2020, they had some big layoffs and so I wasn't

624
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,320
affected by it, thankfully, and I know that me and some of my colleagues that I worked

625
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:56,080
with there had that survivor's remorse, that thing where you feel kind of a little bad,

626
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,080
especially if you've worked.

627
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,640
Like some of the people that was affected, I've worked with them for years.

628
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,000
I mean, some of these are my friends and they've been let go and I haven't been.

629
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,560
So that's also something to not forget.

630
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,120
Of all the people that has been let go, there's also a whole bunch of people that has not

631
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,640
been let go at these companies who had to see their friends be affected like this and

632
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,160
worrying about, are they going to be okay, are they going to find something?

633
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:28,760
I mean, it's a tough time there, like the world is still recovering from COVID and we're

634
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,760
not there yet.

635
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:39,800
So opportunities aren't as plentiful as people would like to think or like to believe.

636
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,160
So yeah, there's both sides to that coin.

637
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:50,200
But I know when people are just going through this, the last thing you want is advice.

638
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,200
You just want somebody to listen.

639
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,000
But whenever people are ready, I think there's two videos on YouTube I recently stumbled

640
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,080
upon that made an impact on me.

641
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,240
The one is from the founder of Wired.

642
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,480
He has this video, I think it's called 38 Pieces of Unsolicited Advice, something like

643
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,480
that.

644
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,360
And one of the things he said is very close to what you've just mentioned, where he said

645
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:21,000
is when you're young, for six months to a year, live as frugally as you can.

646
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,840
So that you know what it is, eat beans and rice, so that you know what that feels like,

647
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,520
so that when you want to take a big chance in your life, you know what it is to be poor.

648
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,760
And it will be, like you said, it will have less an effect on you because you know what

649
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,040
worst case scenario potentially could be.

650
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:47,200
And then the other one was a conversation on the Huberman Lab podcast with Dr. Elia

651
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,200
Crum.

652
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,620
And it's all about mindset.

653
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,640
And that is just brilliant.

654
00:50:52,640 --> 00:51:00,160
It's just incredible the power that our minds have if we and the way we talk to ourselves

655
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,560
and what we put out there and what we'd say when we look in the mirror in the morning.

656
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:11,400
That is such a big impact on how we experience life in general that I think we should really

657
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,440
take time to, like you say, make space for these things and not just be so focused on

658
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,760
the next thing.

659
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:26,320
So you've now touched on a topic in two points, Kalk, that I think is very important as it

660
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,480
relates to all of this.

661
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:32,360
You know, you talked about kind of communication, right, amongst peers and when you're talking

662
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:38,840
to people and what intentional and attentive and listening communication looks like, but

663
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,840
also how we communicate with ourselves.

664
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:48,520
And one of the most transformative books that I have read in the last couple of years is

665
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:54,680
a book called Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg.

666
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:01,720
And I never felt that I was given, through all of my schooling, nobody ever said, like,

667
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:07,400
here's how to intentionally communicate with yourself and others in a nonjudgmental and

668
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,760
compassionate way.

669
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,280
And I just, I've gifted this book dozens of times, I just sent another copy out today,

670
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:20,120
because it gave me the ability to say, all right, this thing I'm feeling, even if it's

671
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:26,000
a negative emotion, fear, anger, frustration, disappointment, whatever it is, there is a

672
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:34,920
positive, like, intention around an unmet need that I have, like, it is doing something

673
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,400
actually to protect me.

674
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,600
I just need to actually give it, like, the attention that it deserves and not look at

675
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:50,480
it as something to judge myself for, but something to explore, like, oh, I'm feeling frustrated

676
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,040
because I needed, or I feel the need for stability, and now I don't have that stability.

677
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:03,920
So what can I do to get to your point, like, to get that stability that I need to for this?

678
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:10,400
But that book has given me the language not only to, like, be less judgmental as I talk

679
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:16,800
to myself, but, like you alluded to earlier, also be able to have those conversations,

680
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,760
especially in, you know, in work settings where disagreements come up or people have

681
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:29,200
differing opinions, like, that book has kind of given me the playbook to just navigate

682
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:38,840
those in a way that, quite candidly, like, feels more intentional and feels good, regardless

683
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:44,640
of what the outcome of it is, like, now I can walk into situations and even if the other

684
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,880
person's yelling at me, I'm okay, because I know I'm showing up the way I wanted to

685
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,440
show up and I'm acknowledging their feelings and all of those things, so I share that as

686
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,640
another resource, I think, that, like, is grounded in me, like, there are some basics

687
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:06,240
here and communications with ourselves and others is, like, an important thing to, you

688
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,120
know, to develop in ourselves.

689
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,160
Yeah, for sure.

690
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,280
I've heard about the book as well.

691
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,120
I haven't read it yet, but it's definitely on my to-read list.

692
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,720
I believe it's literally on my to-read list on Amazon.

693
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,520
I just need to put it in the cart.

694
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:30,000
So I alluded to earlier, like, where I kind of stumbled upon your video, the Monday pep

695
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,040
talk on the Groove community and I think a lot of people that hear this might, Groove

696
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,040
community?

697
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,040
What's that?

698
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:44,400
So I've been involved with them since the very, very beginnings and I've at some point

699
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:51,880
I opened up their Slack and I've been really active there, more so than the app for various

700
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,640
reasons, but don't need to go into that now.

701
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,560
Nothing to do with the app or Groove.

702
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,440
It's like personal situational things that is preventing me from using it as much as

703
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,680
I'd like.

704
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:15,400
And for you, what have you found in the Groove community and how would you, do you think,

705
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,520
would you invite other people to join this community?

706
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,120
What has it added to your life?

707
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,880
Great question.

708
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:31,800
Just to answer the, I have already referred, you know, dozens of people to it.

709
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:38,480
It's important that I talk about my community journey because I, before Groove there was,

710
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,080
and when I was first consulting on my own in Philadelphia, I was a member of like multiple

711
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,200
co-working spaces, which for me was great on so many levels.

712
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,840
Like it gave me access to multiple communities.

713
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,660
I could be around value aligned people.

714
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,160
Like it was awesome.

715
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,960
So when the pandemic hit and like I had stopped working for the company I was working for,

716
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,440
so like I no longer had my co-worker community.

717
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:15,100
I no longer had, you know, co-working space communities.

718
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:22,680
There was a physical co-working space in Philadelphia that stood up an online co-working community.

719
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,960
It's called Indie Hall.

720
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:32,120
And when I discovered Indie Hall, it gave me that thing that I was missing.

721
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:37,400
They had a Discord channel and they had, they just had open co-working channels.

722
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,120
So if you were working, you could just pop into a co-working channel.

723
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,200
Other people could join in.

724
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,320
You could share your video or not, but like it felt like you were in a room with other

725
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,320
people.

726
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:53,940
And I was like, I had no idea how badly I needed this thing until I found this thing.

727
00:56:53,940 --> 00:57:00,440
And then last year I was also introduced to Groove in the early days.

728
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,200
And one of the things that I was struggling with at Indie Hall, especially as things started

729
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,480
to open up physically, is like there were days where I'd be the only person in the virtual

730
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,480
co-working room.

731
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,080
And I was like, this would be better if like there was always people that were in there

732
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,080
with me.

733
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,840
So as soon as I got introduced to Groove, I was like, oh, wait a second.

734
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:25,800
Like I don't want to say guaranteed, but like now the app is at a point, like at any point

735
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,800
of the day, because it is a global community, if I go in there, I'm going to find at least

736
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,480
one person to work with, if not like three others.

737
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,720
And the thing that I have realized, especially through this journey of working for myself

738
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:50,120
and not being in an office anymore and not being, I need that connection desperately

739
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,120
in my day.

740
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:59,520
I need it for accountability, I need it just for the human interaction component.

741
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,520
And Groove does a lot of things really, really well.

742
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:12,880
And just for quick background, there are 50 minute sessions where you get matched up with

743
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,920
up to three other people.

744
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,920
You have a couple minutes to share what you're working on, and then you start work.

745
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:26,720
The timer starts for 50 minutes, everybody's cameras go off and there's just a chat window.

746
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,180
And then you come back after 50 minutes and share what you've worked on.

747
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:37,440
So it has given me that human connection that I was needing kind of desperately.

748
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,760
It's given me the accountability.

749
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:48,040
It has also given me a tremendous amount of grace and compassion for myself, because there

750
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:52,680
are a lot of just good value aligned people on the platform.

751
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,280
And I can't tell you how many grooves I'm on a day where a person is like, here's what

752
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,440
I'm gonna do during this groove and then they come back on and they're like, so I got distracted.

753
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,800
And that is something I joke to people all the time.

754
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,840
It was such a gift because you're like, all right, I'm here for 50 minutes, I have to

755
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,200
get all of this stuff done.

756
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:17,720
And people are like, yeah, I felt the need to clean the dishes and then pet the dog.

757
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,520
And then I sent them.

758
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,920
But it also gave me this very just reminder that we need to show ourselves and one another

759
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,400
grace and compassion.

760
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:39,480
So I joke that it is a human connection app that is masquerading as a productivity app.

761
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,240
Because I feel like it gives you so much more than just that.

762
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,160
Yeah, that's a very good description of it.

763
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,400
I love that.

764
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:59,900
And I have to say, as a introvert myself, I would go so far as to say to other introverts,

765
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:04,840
you need more human connection than you think you do.

766
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:09,800
Oftentimes the story out there is that if you're an introvert, people drain your energy.

767
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:16,600
And while that's true to some extent, not having any is definitely detrimental to your

768
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,460
mental well-being.

769
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:25,760
So even if you see yourself as an introvert, I'd still encourage you to give these networks.

770
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,480
Maybe it's Groove, maybe it's something else.

771
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,480
Give it a try, because you'd be surprised how energized you feel after you've had that

772
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,480
human connection.

773
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,840
I mean, you can limit it to the number of grooves that you feel comfortable doing in

774
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
a day.

775
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,160
There's no obligation to join one off to the other off to the other.

776
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:48,220
If one is enough for you to get the energy that you need, that's great.

777
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:53,440
Maybe the person on the other side of that screen also just needed that one thing that

778
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,440
day.

779
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,800
So yeah, I definitely encourage people, even if you're an introvert, give it a shot.

780
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,400
It might do more for you than you think.

781
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,400
I love that, Skulk.

782
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,200
And I'll add to that, you can test lots of communities.

783
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,320
Sometimes you're not going to find the community that meets you where you are on the first

784
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,320
try.

785
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:19,960
One of my friend's expressions, which I like, is just find your weirdos.

786
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:24,920
There's a group of people that you can connect with out there.

787
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920
They exist.

788
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,800
You just need to find them.

789
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:33,720
I feel like there's places like Discord and Reddit where niche groups are popping up.

790
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:41,320
To your point, we do all need that connection and we can find it with people that get us

791
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,200
just as we are, right?

792
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,720
We don't have to be or do anything different.

793
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,840
We can just show up as we are and there's communities that will fully accept us that

794
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
way.

795
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,840
We just have to find them.

796
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,560
Yeah, that's very, very true.

797
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,680
Well said.

798
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:01,820
So I have one question left, but I have another question that's popped into my head while

799
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:07,040
I was watching you on camera, because there's a Venn diagram on your wall.

800
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,040
And I'm curious what that Venn diagram is about, if you can share.

801
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,040
Yeah.

802
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:20,520
It was by a local artist here in Philly and it's just daytime, nighttime, and the middle

803
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,960
of the Venn diagram is best time.

804
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,400
Gotcha.

805
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:35,880
So yeah, it's just that space in between your day and your night that is the middle of the

806
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,280
diagram.

807
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,280
Yeah.

808
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,880
For me, the nighttime would be the big overlap.

809
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,320
I'm definitely a night owl.

810
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:51,080
I fought against it, but like so many things in life, it's best to play to your strengths

811
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:57,920
and not try to change because the world isn't necessarily set up for how you work best.

812
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:04,920
There's always ways to find loopholes, find workarounds that you can make the wall a little

813
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:12,160
bit more welcoming, I don't know if that's the right word, but twist the world to work

814
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,760
with you instead of trying to change yourself to fit the world.

815
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,120
I think that's what I was trying to say.

816
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,440
Harmony is the word that's been coming up in a lot of conversations recently, right?

817
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:28,720
You're just trying to find your place in the world that kind of feels harmonious for you.

818
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,280
It may not exist in all of those existing structures that you've been around, it doesn't

819
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,040
mean it doesn't exist at all, right?

820
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,560
Yeah, for sure.

821
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,560
Yeah.

822
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:45,320
So in closing, this has been wonderful, a question that I like to throw in every now

823
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,560
and again because it's a tough one, but I think once people think about it a little

824
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,400
bit, beautiful things come from it.

825
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:02,840
So what is the best advice you've received in your life so far?

826
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:08,360
This is one, when you shared it at Skulk ahead of time, I was like, oh man, this is a tough

827
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:21,640
one for me to answer with a single response and I've been realizing I'm trying to be much

828
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:30,040
more attentive to answering the prompts because I've noticed my ability to not answer the

829
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:38,600
direct question, so the best advice I have received in your life, so I've really received

830
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:54,640
in my life so far is...

831
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:08,620
I think this is gonna go back to my earlier point around focus on how you wanna feel first.

832
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:15,580
Being someone that struggled with anger and frustration previously in my life, I went

833
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:23,960
into last year and my single target feeling was a feeling of peace and I reminded myself

834
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:33,160
of that every single day and despite a year that had plenty of ups and downs, I felt largely

835
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:39,120
at peace all of last year and I think that was just attributed to saying this is how

836
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:45,760
I wanna feel and I'm gonna remind myself every day that even if I am in situations that are

837
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,320
not peaceful, it doesn't mean I can't show up in a peaceful and intentional way.

838
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:58,800
Yeah, that's beautiful, that makes me think of what story Thich Nhat Hanh, I don't know

839
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:04,880
if it's a story or if it's just something he's been known to quote and he's like, if

840
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:12,000
you're on a boat and the sea is rough, it only takes one person to stay calm to ensure

841
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,720
that the boat doesn't capsize, so maybe you can be that one person when life's chaotic

842
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:24,520
that just brings a little bit of peace and then it spreads and before you know it, everybody

843
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,400
is a little bit more peaceful.

844
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,080
Thank you so much, Matthew, this has been beautiful, it's been lovely.

845
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:36,120
I'm so glad I asked you, I knew this was gonna be a good conversation.

846
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,800
Thank you so much for joining.

847
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:44,680
Thank you again for the opportunity, Skalk, I've really, I've enjoyed it, I'm also, story

848
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:51,440
for another time, but I love a career that is a mosaic like my own, so we'll have to

849
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,240
find time, I'd love to hear more about your journey as well and the last thing I'll end

850
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:02,680
on is like, the thing I love to do is have these conversations with people and like I'm

851
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:08,200
willing to invest time in people regardless of where they are, so if there's anything

852
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:14,600
I can ever do to kind of support you or anyone in your community, please never hesitate to

853
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:15,600
ask.

854
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:23,080
I mean that so sincerely, like it's important, it's important to me to kind of support people

855
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:30,160
regardless of where they are on their journeys, so just please take it as an open invitation.

856
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:35,600
Okay, thank you so much, Matthew, that's lovely, I appreciate that.

857
01:07:35,600 --> 01:08:04,320
Have a lovely rest of your day.
