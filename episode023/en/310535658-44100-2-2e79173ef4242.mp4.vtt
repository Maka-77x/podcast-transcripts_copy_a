Welcome to the Marsilian Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:10.160
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:10.160 --> 00:15.320
Hey, welcome, Matthew, and welcome to the Marsilian Network Podcast.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.320
Thank you so much, Skalk.

00:16.320 --> 00:21.600
Thanks again for the invitation and thanks for the opportunity to share a little bit

00:21.600 --> 00:24.520
of my journey with your audience.

00:24.520 --> 00:28.120
Yeah, no, it's my pleasure.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.960
So let's jump right into it.

00:31.960 --> 00:38.320
Let's start off with you telling us more about who is Matthew and what do you do and, yeah,

00:38.320 --> 00:39.320
all about you.

00:39.320 --> 00:45.920
So I will start off by sharing, like, this is a question that used to scare me and make

00:45.920 --> 00:48.560
me nervous a little bit.

00:48.560 --> 00:55.020
As you will quickly learn, I have had quite a circuitous career path.

00:55.020 --> 01:01.560
So I tell people I'm on about my seventh major career change, and whereas before I would

01:01.560 --> 01:07.560
be told to, like, hide parts of my story and journey, now I feel like I'm kind of living

01:07.560 --> 01:13.400
a life where I can own the full journey and see kind of the meaning and purpose in each

01:13.400 --> 01:15.800
step of it.

01:15.800 --> 01:21.880
But I will give a slightly abbreviated version of the steps, but I tell people I started

01:21.880 --> 01:26.440
my career very intentionally.

01:26.440 --> 01:33.800
In school, I was a civil and environmental engineering major, and my intention was to

01:33.800 --> 01:42.240
kind of use environmental engineering as a kind of platform to make change in the world.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.240
And quickly, I discovered a couple of things.

01:46.240 --> 01:55.680
I wasn't a very good engineer, and it so happened that I had a positive aptitude for technology,

01:55.680 --> 02:02.020
and I credit my employer at the time because they were like, hey, you seem to be struggling

02:02.020 --> 02:06.600
in some of your fieldwork, but we see you have this kind of aptitude for technology.

02:06.600 --> 02:12.300
Like would you consider supporting, you know, our head of technology in kind of supporting

02:12.300 --> 02:13.300
the office?

02:13.300 --> 02:16.980
And I was like, sure, I was interested in it, I was passionate about it.

02:16.980 --> 02:23.680
So that was first, like, career change number one was from environmental engineer to IT

02:23.680 --> 02:27.880
support person and network administrator.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.360
And I quickly learned it was work I loved to do.

02:32.360 --> 02:38.340
And like I said, I was kind of naturally good at it and interested in it.

02:38.340 --> 02:43.760
So after that role ended, I actually went into the world to see if I could find, you

02:43.760 --> 02:47.120
know, an IT support job.

02:47.120 --> 02:54.360
And after a lot of reflection, that was the last time I like looked for a job in a traditional

02:54.360 --> 02:57.960
like sending cover letters and resumes out kind of a way.

02:57.960 --> 03:02.820
And that was in 1999.

03:02.820 --> 03:06.960
And I went to job fairs, and I sent out a bunch of resumes, and I got a job with a small

03:06.960 --> 03:09.720
IT consulting company.

03:09.720 --> 03:16.360
And my first project was desktop support in a hospital and was responsible for, you know,

03:16.360 --> 03:19.360
just supporting all of their users.

03:19.360 --> 03:24.440
And as you will hear my story, there's a lot of alignment to major things in the world.

03:24.440 --> 03:31.440
So on New Year's Eve of 1999, I was working desktop support in a hospital.

03:31.440 --> 03:38.080
So like, at 1159, I was in the hospital with a team like waiting for the world to collapse

03:38.080 --> 03:43.680
and all the hospital machines to go down, you know, when the clock struck midnight.

03:43.680 --> 03:49.680
And that did not happen, you know, but at 1201, the hospital was fine.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.600
This is the like systems were all fine.

03:53.600 --> 03:59.520
But shortly after the company, the consulting company I was working for had an opportunity

03:59.520 --> 04:07.680
in Boston to support this up and coming internet holding company called Internet Capital Group.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.800
And I was the youngest person on the team, not the most qualified.

04:11.800 --> 04:18.000
And they were like, would you consider moving to Boston to support this company that's kind

04:18.000 --> 04:19.680
of in this massive state of growth?

04:19.680 --> 04:26.240
And I was like, sure, like I was 20 nothing and I was like, seems like a great opportunity.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.240
And I'll never forget, I went up there to interview with at the time, that's kind of small team

04:30.240 --> 04:31.720
of senior executives.

04:31.720 --> 04:37.920
And I remember the office manager saying to me like, I don't need you to be like a brilliant

04:37.920 --> 04:39.360
technologist.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.440
I need you to be able to communicate with our people in a like thoughtful and transparent

04:44.440 --> 04:47.640
way.

04:47.640 --> 04:54.120
And so within a week or two, I packed up my bags and I moved to Boston and I started supporting

04:54.120 --> 05:01.840
this company that grew out of a very small office space over the course of about 12 months

05:01.840 --> 05:07.040
into a 20,000 square foot office space that I helped with everything from finding the

05:07.040 --> 05:13.680
space to ordering the furniture to building it out to helping build the technology network.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.760
And it was just an awesome project.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.840
I was given a lot of responsibility and I just I love so much about it.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.760
And this is kind of alignment with world affairs.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.640
That was the first bubble burst.

05:26.640 --> 05:33.240
So within a period of about 12 months, we moved into this office, we invested all of

05:33.240 --> 05:39.060
this money into this office just to have to shut it down.

05:39.060 --> 05:43.840
So within a few months, we were subleasing the space and the furniture we were they were

05:43.840 --> 05:46.720
laying off most of the staff.

05:46.720 --> 05:54.120
My last kind of job there was to set up the last five people in home offices.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.880
And at that point, so that this is kind of a next big transition.

05:56.880 --> 06:01.360
My company didn't have any other work for me in Boston.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.880
And I didn't want to move back.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.680
I'd only been there like a year and a half.

06:04.680 --> 06:09.160
So this is my I tell people this is my first negotiated separation.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.000
I was like, I still want to do this work.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.160
Like, I'm in contract with you.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.400
I can't work for any clients like would you be considering to waive that?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.600
This company still has a little bit of work for me.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.920
There's some other projects up here they'd like me to do.

06:23.920 --> 06:31.440
So they accepted my proposal and that was my first kind of foray into working for myself.

06:31.440 --> 06:36.560
So I had a couple of clients and in Boston and then I picked up another one in New York

06:36.560 --> 06:43.320
who is a friend who owned a brokerage on the American Stock Exchange.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.760
And so I was helping him with some technology and operations stuff.

06:46.760 --> 06:52.280
And he one day he was like, listen, why don't you just move to New York?

06:52.280 --> 06:53.800
I will teach you this business.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.520
You can be our in-house technology and operations person.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.520
And again, and this is a theme you will see like I was doing a lot of reacting at this

07:01.520 --> 07:03.320
point in my career.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.200
Like I didn't really have a vision that I was like, oh, this is the thing I want to

07:07.200 --> 07:08.200
do.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
I was like, oh, look, opportunity.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.160
I'll just follow this thing.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.840
So I moved up to New York.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.520
I kind of took the job.

07:15.520 --> 07:20.800
I signed my lease on the Friday before September 11th.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.960
And September 11th happened and both my boss and my landlord were like, listen, if you

07:24.960 --> 07:29.480
don't want to come now, we understand.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.800
But I was already packed.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.600
I was like, I'm committed to this move.

07:33.600 --> 07:41.520
And so on October 1st of 2001, I started at the American Stock Exchange and it was an

07:41.520 --> 07:42.800
unnerving period.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.560
I mean, the stock exchange was only a couple blocks south of ground zero.

07:46.560 --> 07:53.960
A lot of people down there had lost people in their firms, their friends, family members.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.720
But yeah, so that was another big transition.

07:57.720 --> 08:08.320
And I tell people I learned very early in that job that the environment was not necessarily

08:08.320 --> 08:10.960
in alignment with my values.

08:10.960 --> 08:19.160
And the story I share, Skulk, is I would go into, within three months, I was on a seat,

08:19.160 --> 08:22.840
which meant I was a broker that would run into all the crowds.

08:22.840 --> 08:28.560
And I would run in and I would ask for a quote or place an order and I would always say please

08:28.560 --> 08:29.560
and thank you.

08:29.560 --> 08:33.740
And I will never forget someone said to me, you must be new here.

08:33.740 --> 08:36.160
No one says please and thank you.

08:36.160 --> 08:42.800
So for an environment to so clearly state, it's not civil here.

08:42.800 --> 08:48.140
And that within a few years, it really took a toll on me from a stress perspective.

08:48.140 --> 08:50.720
It was very, very intense.

08:50.720 --> 08:58.960
And my boss was a dear friend and he underlined the fact and this is another crystallized

08:58.960 --> 08:59.960
moment in my head.

08:59.960 --> 09:06.080
He was like, the people here will screw you for one penny.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.480
No one here is your friend.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.100
And that was just one of those things where you're like, you don't want to believe it,

09:12.100 --> 09:15.360
but you see enough of it and it was kind of like, I need to get out of here.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.240
So that was my second negotiated separation.

09:19.240 --> 09:25.500
I said, I need to transition into something a little bit more fulfilling for me.

09:25.500 --> 09:29.680
It was at a time where that business was changing because of technology.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.400
So he was also happy.

09:32.400 --> 09:39.280
So negotiated a three month kind of transition and I said, listen, I will be on call for

09:39.280 --> 09:40.540
these three months.

09:40.540 --> 09:46.280
So if you need anything, you can always call me, but I'm going to look for a new job.

09:46.280 --> 09:50.320
This is an important transition because this was the first time I was like, all right,

09:50.320 --> 09:56.720
if I want to define kind of a personal mission for this next phase of my career, what will

09:56.720 --> 09:59.880
that be?

09:59.880 --> 10:04.600
And where I landed was like, so I had this technology experience, now I have this financial

10:04.600 --> 10:06.640
services experience.

10:06.640 --> 10:11.960
I said, I want to help make the global markets more efficient.

10:11.960 --> 10:15.740
And in retrospect, it was like, it was a good mission statement.

10:15.740 --> 10:18.840
It wasn't necessarily like a real purposeful one.

10:18.840 --> 10:24.800
Like, it will come as no surprise, like I saw opportunity to make a lot of money in

10:24.800 --> 10:29.000
that field and this seemed like a mission that like I could find something that at least

10:29.000 --> 10:34.480
allowed me to take advantage of my strengths and kind of the intersection of these things

10:34.480 --> 10:38.080
where I was interested.

10:38.080 --> 10:42.400
And I will say this has informed a lot of our process at Career Edge.

10:42.400 --> 10:48.880
So what I did in that moment was I said, I like technology, I like financial services,

10:48.880 --> 10:51.520
there's a lot of people that work in this space.

10:51.520 --> 10:57.800
So I talked to people that worked at stock exchanges, I talked to people that worked

10:57.800 --> 11:02.320
like in the banks and other financial institutions that were present there.

11:02.320 --> 11:06.640
I talked to software companies, there were a lot of software companies at that time that

11:06.640 --> 11:09.720
were growing quickly and moving into the space.

11:09.720 --> 11:16.280
And then I talked to consultancies that were helping integrate technology into financial

11:16.280 --> 11:20.280
service institutions.

11:20.280 --> 11:26.880
All I did during those three months was make connections with people at all of those industries

11:26.880 --> 11:32.400
to learn about their journeys, learn about their jobs, learn about all of the things

11:32.400 --> 11:38.920
that helped them be successful in their roles.

11:38.920 --> 11:44.000
And where I ended up landing was the consulting space seems like a great opportunity for me

11:44.000 --> 11:47.880
to work for a lot of different clients at this intersection.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.160
This is another important story I share with people.

11:50.160 --> 11:55.240
So I had a friend who worked at Accenture, a big global consultancy, I told him what

11:55.240 --> 11:56.240
I was looking for.

11:56.240 --> 12:00.520
He said, we are really looking for people at this intersection of technology and financial

12:00.520 --> 12:01.520
services.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.000
I'll send you the link to apply for this role.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.440
I was like, great.

12:06.440 --> 12:07.440
So I applied.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.600
And then a couple of days I get the stock, sorry, we're not interested.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.560
Your skills do not align to our needs.

12:13.560 --> 12:19.080
And I forwarded along to my friend and I said, thank you so much for the support, but it

12:19.080 --> 12:21.360
looks like I'm not a fit.

12:21.360 --> 12:26.360
And I share this story because it just goes to show you like this system doesn't always

12:26.360 --> 12:28.520
work as designed.

12:28.520 --> 12:33.000
Because when he got that email, he flipped out.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.760
He forwarded it to the head of financial services at Accenture and he forwarded to the head

12:37.760 --> 12:43.600
of human resources and he said, you've been telling me how badly we need people at the

12:43.600 --> 12:46.640
intersection of technology and financial services.

12:46.640 --> 12:56.640
I just gave you this perfect candidate and you just denied them even an initial conversation.

12:56.640 --> 13:02.960
And then I very quickly got a call from HR, I very quickly got scheduled for 10 of a series

13:02.960 --> 13:03.960
of interviews.

13:03.960 --> 13:08.880
And anyway, long story short, a month or two later, I got a job at Accenture and it was

13:08.880 --> 13:09.880
perfect.

13:09.880 --> 13:16.760
This project was a new order management system for the New York Stock Exchange.

13:16.760 --> 13:22.440
So I was able to for the first time to like articulate a vision and actually find an opportunity

13:22.440 --> 13:25.680
that met that vision.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.160
And this is where I will fast forward a little.

13:27.160 --> 13:33.080
So I spent seven years there, I got to work on great projects around the world.

13:33.080 --> 13:39.400
But in late 2012, I was working on a compliance project at a big bank in New York and I woke

13:39.400 --> 13:44.080
up one morning and there was an email from the managing director who I was working for

13:44.080 --> 13:49.120
and it said, your aggression is not going unnoticed.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.760
And I read below and in the middle of the night, I had sent some scathing email to some

13:53.760 --> 13:58.880
poor project manager because their status report wasn't right.

13:58.880 --> 14:06.960
And I was like, I have now compromised my values and need to really kind of reflect

14:06.960 --> 14:09.680
and make a more intentional transition.

14:09.680 --> 14:17.160
So I kind of negotiated a, you know, essentially a transition of my role.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.080
I took a six month leave of absence and Accenture was great.

14:20.080 --> 14:23.160
They said you can come back and have your same job.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.680
You can come back and do something different on the other side of the world or, you know,

14:26.680 --> 14:32.660
if you don't want to come back, we'll kind of share going recommendations for you.

14:32.660 --> 14:38.040
So after like taking two months to just completely decompress, I did another like exploration.

14:38.040 --> 14:42.200
I talked to people in and around areas of interest to me.

14:42.200 --> 14:47.300
And at the time, I just wanted to do something with more of an impact on the world.

14:47.300 --> 14:52.920
So fast forward, I was kind of like, I have all of this knowledge around strategy and

14:52.920 --> 14:53.920
operations.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.440
I just would like to use it for more intentional causes.

14:56.440 --> 15:04.120
So I worked for a bunch of nonprofits, social enterprises and startups in and around kind

15:04.120 --> 15:06.360
of Philadelphia.

15:06.360 --> 15:08.960
And again, I was working for myself.

15:08.960 --> 15:13.040
I was creating these consulting opportunities.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.540
And after a couple of years of doing that, one of my clients said, you know, I need you

15:16.540 --> 15:18.380
all in or out.

15:18.380 --> 15:24.580
And it was an opportunity to work in social impact real estate to really make a meaningful

15:24.580 --> 15:28.120
change in a couple of underserved communities in Philadelphia.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.040
So I went all in on that.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.640
And I spent five years there.

15:32.640 --> 15:39.280
And the biggest lesson learned from that part of the story is even the thing you think sounds

15:39.280 --> 15:46.920
perfect and aligned to the vision that you have for yourself may not be what you expect

15:46.920 --> 15:48.920
it to be.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.720
And you know, what I mean by that is like, this was another thing that I never tested

15:52.720 --> 15:54.400
what it was like to be in real estate.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.240
I was so excited by the vision.

15:56.240 --> 16:01.640
I didn't like take a take a moment to be like, hey, what's it going to be like when people

16:01.640 --> 16:06.080
are calling you at three o'clock in the morning to tell you there's a leak in the building

16:06.080 --> 16:09.320
or somebody has like.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.640
So great experience.

16:10.640 --> 16:11.640
I learned a lot.

16:11.640 --> 16:17.080
But then at the end of 2020, I was like, this is this is not the way that most suits me

16:17.080 --> 16:19.240
to create the impact I want to make.

16:19.240 --> 16:23.360
And so again, I transitioned and I negotiated a separation.

16:23.360 --> 16:27.160
I said, I'll step down my time.

16:27.160 --> 16:32.280
We actually kind of co-created some consulting engagements for me, and the company was fine

16:32.280 --> 16:36.280
to let me take those on my own.

16:36.280 --> 16:42.360
And then during that time, I really started to reflect again and say, what is at this

16:42.360 --> 16:45.320
intersection of the impact I want to create?

16:45.320 --> 16:48.200
And also the work that really kind of energizes me.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.920
And that that kind of spawned the start of career edge.

16:51.920 --> 16:57.360
And my younger brother and I started it just by interviewing 80 people about their jobs

16:57.360 --> 17:01.320
and what was working for them and what wasn't.

17:01.320 --> 17:07.280
And we are still very much a work in progress, but the majority of my days today are spent

17:07.280 --> 17:14.820
helping people find more fulfillment in their in their professional lives.

17:14.820 --> 17:18.880
And I tell people it's taken me 46 years to get here.

17:18.880 --> 17:24.000
But now I finally like wake up every morning and and realize like this is what I was meant

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
to be doing.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.040
So I realize it's a very long story, but it's important.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.040
Like I said.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.040
That's great.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
Yeah.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.040
No, that's great.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.040
That is lovely.

17:34.040 --> 17:37.360
That's so many turns that that life took.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.440
And I mean, I can I can associate with that.

17:39.440 --> 17:51.280
I've also been from a musician to classical guitarist to a tech person to working in corporate

17:51.280 --> 17:53.920
to not fitting at all.

17:53.920 --> 18:00.080
And eventually like ending up doing my own thing and finding that caring about other

18:00.080 --> 18:01.920
people is what I really want to do.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.080
And so try to find where that's like what led to some of these things like the community

18:06.080 --> 18:07.080
that I started.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.640
There's these podcasts and all of that stuff.

18:09.640 --> 18:16.400
And I hear some of the same undertones in your story a lot, a lot of change, but change

18:16.400 --> 18:20.520
into the direction of where people's journey is important.

18:20.520 --> 18:26.560
Having impact that is meaningful is is important to you.

18:26.560 --> 18:32.920
And you brought up a career itch from I hope I said that correctly.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.200
And the work that you do there.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.840
And I think on your LinkedIn page, there's this one liner that is I hope people find

18:39.840 --> 18:43.440
professional peace and create a future they proud of.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.400
I mean, who doesn't want that?

18:45.400 --> 18:52.800
So if somebody comes to you and they say, I don't know, I'm at one of these points,

18:52.800 --> 18:58.840
these inflection points in my life, and I have this opportunity to rethink my career

18:58.840 --> 19:00.680
and rethink what I do.

19:00.680 --> 19:06.520
How would you go about helping them to find professional peace and create a future they

19:06.520 --> 19:09.920
can be proud of?

19:09.920 --> 19:10.920
Great question, Scott.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.960
I think the thing that I have realized, and again, this has even been an evolution for

19:14.960 --> 19:24.960
me is I think it is so important to start from a place of exploring how you feel currently

19:24.960 --> 19:28.120
and how you want to feel.

19:28.120 --> 19:33.640
My corporate and professional training was always so focused on like tangible and specific

19:33.640 --> 19:38.800
like strategic financial operational goals.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.680
We were never, you know, feeling was never a metric, right?

19:42.680 --> 19:47.120
Like no one ever said, hey, how do you feel?

19:47.120 --> 19:50.760
And how do you want to feel?

19:50.760 --> 19:53.800
And the thing that I've learned, and I've learned this even with my own life and on

19:53.800 --> 20:02.360
my own journey, like starting from that place of like exploring what you're feeling now

20:02.360 --> 20:08.880
and the source of those feelings, and then like really starting to ground yourself in

20:08.880 --> 20:15.480
the positive feelings you want to feel, and the reality is, and I have seen this over

20:15.480 --> 20:20.120
and over again with people that I've spoken with.

20:20.120 --> 20:29.160
If you've had difficult and challenging professional experiences, they actually are stronger than

20:29.160 --> 20:30.680
the positive ones.

20:30.680 --> 20:36.840
So I've had to reconnect people to positive experiences because they've forgotten them

20:36.840 --> 20:44.560
because of the current like, you know, work stress or work challenge they're having.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.360
So that's usually where we start.

20:46.360 --> 20:51.880
Like how are you feeling, like what's coming up for you, and how do you want to feel, and

20:51.880 --> 20:54.760
have you felt the way you want to feel before?

20:54.760 --> 20:57.880
And most people can answer that question positively, right?

20:57.880 --> 21:03.480
Like even regardless of what the memory is, personal or professional, they can say, I

21:03.480 --> 21:11.000
have felt at peace or I have felt alive or I have felt energized doing these things.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.760
So that's the thing that like I always start by connecting, reconnecting people to that.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.880
And I will say I've noticed this in my own life as well.

21:22.880 --> 21:29.280
Like that has some of the biggest downstream effect as it relates to like personal and

21:29.280 --> 21:35.800
professional like fulfillment and success, is that how do I want to feel and letting

21:35.800 --> 21:41.080
that kind of be a bit of a north star?

21:41.080 --> 21:43.320
And I think you alluded to this.

21:43.320 --> 21:49.080
I think that the next thing in another part of this process is like, what are the questions

21:49.080 --> 21:54.400
or the prompts to get people thinking more about those things that kind of energize them

21:54.400 --> 21:56.240
or that make them feel purposeful?

21:56.240 --> 22:03.800
So questions like, hey, what problems in the world are you interested in solving or helping

22:03.800 --> 22:06.640
to solve?

22:06.640 --> 22:10.920
Where in the world would you like to make a meaningful impact?

22:10.920 --> 22:19.720
Specifically, what people in the world would you like to help or support or make successful?

22:19.720 --> 22:25.600
So the next thing is really exploring some of those questions around purpose and whether

22:25.600 --> 22:32.760
you've been asked them or not, like there's usually something inside you intuitively that

22:32.760 --> 22:35.640
is like, yeah, these are the things that are important to me.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.840
These are the things I care about.

22:37.840 --> 22:43.800
And again, if we are playing the traditional job searching game, we're not starting from

22:43.800 --> 22:45.640
that place, right?

22:45.640 --> 22:50.280
We're starting from a place of finding a thing that fits our skills.

22:50.280 --> 22:56.440
We're not starting from a place of, hey, what can I connect to that's real purposeful?

22:56.440 --> 22:59.760
And what value can I create in those spaces?

22:59.760 --> 23:06.400
So I would say those are the two things I think that really start like a healthier waterfall

23:06.400 --> 23:11.360
that focus on feelings and that focus on kind of purpose exploration.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.360
Yeah, that is wonderful.

23:15.360 --> 23:19.560
I think there's a really, I think a lot of people will find that useful to hear because

23:19.560 --> 23:20.840
I agree.

23:20.840 --> 23:28.760
We often start with looking at job boards from a skills perspective instead of from

23:28.760 --> 23:34.840
a culture perspective or from a, what does this company stand for?

23:34.840 --> 23:40.400
What are they trying to accomplish in the world and does it fit with what I'm doing?

23:40.400 --> 23:44.320
Because I mean, most job postings don't even talk about that really.

23:44.320 --> 23:49.400
They're more about like this long list of skills that you need, which most of the time

23:49.400 --> 23:55.560
is completely unreasonable by itself, but the focus is heavily on the skills, not so

23:55.560 --> 24:03.840
much on this is how you would have an impact in the company if you do pursue this role.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.440
And this is the overarching goal of the company.

24:07.440 --> 24:14.520
So if you take this role, your technical skills or whatever will contribute to the company

24:14.520 --> 24:17.440
in this way, which will contribute to our end goal in this way.

24:17.440 --> 24:23.860
So I think that's a much more healthier, much more long-term way to think about these things.

24:23.860 --> 24:31.760
But irrespective of whether you are on your own journey, doing your own thing or working

24:31.760 --> 24:38.120
for an employer, there are times in the day or in the week or in the month or in the year

24:38.120 --> 24:42.840
where it just feels like, I need something.

24:42.840 --> 24:45.960
I need somebody to tell me this is all going to be okay.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.360
And you do this thing called the Monday Pit Talk.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.000
That's how I learned about you.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.880
One of these was shared by one of the folks from Groove on the Groove community Slack.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.160
And I checked that out and I was like, this is so cool.

24:59.160 --> 25:03.960
So how did you come about this idea and where do you or how do you come up with the topics

25:03.960 --> 25:06.360
that you discuss in these pit talks?

25:06.360 --> 25:08.640
Well, thank you, Skulk.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.880
I appreciate the kind and supportive words.

25:12.880 --> 25:13.880
It's funny.

25:13.880 --> 25:19.600
So it started early days in the pandemic, you know, when we were going very quickly

25:19.600 --> 25:25.480
from in person to like virtual meetings and video calls all day.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.680
I learned a couple of things early on.

25:28.680 --> 25:36.640
Everybody, despite what they were going through kind of emotionally, they got peace from just

25:36.640 --> 25:42.200
having like a smiling and supportive face on the other side of the camera.

25:42.200 --> 25:47.840
And I like specifically remember people saying to me like, thank you.

25:47.840 --> 25:54.360
Like I feel comfortable like in this space that doesn't feel comfortable.

25:54.360 --> 26:00.520
And this falls into the category of like a lot of my life was I felt I lived without

26:00.520 --> 26:03.520
an awareness or like I wasn't paying attention.

26:03.520 --> 26:08.360
And I felt like I was at a point where I was paying attention and like it started to come

26:08.360 --> 26:09.360
up more and more.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.080
And I was like, all right, so this is an interesting data point.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.440
Like let's hold on to this.

26:14.440 --> 26:21.960
And then the other thing that really started to become fascinating to me was in a lot of

26:21.960 --> 26:26.640
those interviews where I was just kind of hearing people's journeys and stories and

26:26.640 --> 26:36.120
offering, you know, a new or a different perspective, sometimes all people needed was a different

26:36.120 --> 26:41.680
perspective, right, especially in things that like they were consumed with, right.

26:41.680 --> 26:46.480
And like for whatever reason, like, we're so focused that they weren't kind of seeing

26:46.480 --> 26:48.560
other perspectives and opportunities.

26:48.560 --> 26:54.720
So I was realizing in a lot of these interactions that just by sharing a story or a perspective

26:54.720 --> 27:01.120
or like a helpful thing that had helped me was enough to at least kind of trigger, oh,

27:01.120 --> 27:02.120
that feels different.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.680
That may be something I can try.

27:03.680 --> 27:09.520
So you know, it obviously took me like the better part of a, you know, nine months to

27:09.520 --> 27:14.640
a year after I had those kind of couple of realizations to formulate what is now the

27:14.640 --> 27:16.280
Monday morning pep talk.

27:16.280 --> 27:24.080
But yeah, so I ended up doing 30 of them last year and it just felt good, quite candidly,

27:24.080 --> 27:33.920
to like do something, you know, kind of public facing and not be too attached to the outcome.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.100
I was like, I want to do this because I want to get this message out there.

27:37.100 --> 27:40.720
And like, I can obsess over everything from like production value to low.

27:40.720 --> 27:47.200
And I'm like, I just want to share this and so yeah, that's kind of how it started.

27:47.200 --> 27:51.080
And I will say I reflected on a lot of it last year.

27:51.080 --> 27:57.000
And in going into this year, I'm doing things a little bit differently.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.640
One of the things I realized I did last year a lot of in my coaching and in my content

28:01.640 --> 28:05.960
was focused on problems.

28:05.960 --> 28:11.680
And this year, like what the thing that has been coming up a lot for me is like, we're

28:11.680 --> 28:21.480
not problems to be fixed, right, like we're the framing that's been helpful for me is

28:21.480 --> 28:28.640
like, we have this like true authentic self, like at the heart of ourselves, that unfortunately

28:28.640 --> 28:35.200
has been covered up by a lot of things, society, right, like our work environments, especially

28:35.200 --> 28:36.640
unhealthy work environments.

28:36.640 --> 28:41.880
So all of these layers over time have like covered up a lot of what is our like real

28:41.880 --> 28:43.480
and true identities.

28:43.480 --> 28:50.760
So the shift this year is going to be a little bit more kind of positive focused and really

28:50.760 --> 28:54.760
focused on like, hey, let's actually tap into strengths.

28:54.760 --> 29:02.080
Like let's not look at you as a problem to be fixed, you know, or to be solved.

29:02.080 --> 29:08.280
Let's look at like tapping into that kind of truest version and most authentic version

29:08.280 --> 29:14.680
of yourself and let that kind of be the guide and not treat like your life is something

29:14.680 --> 29:18.040
to be triaged all the time, if that makes sense.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.000
So I'm still evolving it.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.680
Yeah, that makes complete sense.

29:22.680 --> 29:23.680
Yeah, for sure.

29:23.680 --> 29:37.200
I think society has evolved or devolved maybe into this idea that human beings are a collection

29:37.200 --> 29:44.200
of problems that needs to be addressed instead of celebrating maybe sometimes some of these

29:44.200 --> 29:46.380
quote unquote problems.

29:46.380 --> 29:53.680
Maybe they are just differences that for some reason has been termed to be problems.

29:53.680 --> 29:54.680
So yeah, I love that.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.680
I love that refocusing.

29:55.680 --> 30:04.360
And I think there's so much negativity going on in the world that I think of a refocus

30:04.360 --> 30:07.640
on what's good and what's positive is definitely a good call.

30:07.640 --> 30:13.480
So I 100% support that focus change.

30:13.480 --> 30:20.440
Speaking about that, so the Mycelium network community was founded around the idea that

30:20.440 --> 30:26.080
I've heard from a lot of early stage web developers specifically.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.760
And this runs the gamut.

30:27.760 --> 30:32.520
It's from like people who are like 16, 17 years old, all the way to people who's in

30:32.520 --> 30:36.720
their 40s and 50s that's just decided like, I want to try something else.

30:36.720 --> 30:41.680
Like, I mean, like you said, and like I mentioned, like, we've had all these career changes during

30:41.680 --> 30:42.680
our lifetime.

30:42.680 --> 30:51.520
So I don't think this idea of school, university, job, retirement, I think that that whole cycle

30:51.520 --> 30:57.760
has been completely broken apart and I don't think it's something that people do anymore.

30:57.760 --> 31:02.780
But you know, and some of these people have decided to do it via starting their own business.

31:02.780 --> 31:06.320
Some people are going for employment.

31:06.320 --> 31:10.360
Maybe they're finding that that company that they can believe in, in the mission and everything

31:10.360 --> 31:14.440
and they want to build a career there.

31:14.440 --> 31:20.400
But the one thing that I've found with all these folks is it's scary, right?

31:20.400 --> 31:24.720
Whether it's your first time going out there in the big wide world trying to find your

31:24.720 --> 31:32.440
place or whether it's having to prove yourself yet again in a new industry.

31:32.440 --> 31:39.920
So for people that is doing one of these two ways of getting into a new career, like, what

31:39.920 --> 31:40.920
would you tell them?

31:40.920 --> 31:45.680
How do they, how should they approach this, whether it's starting off or whether it's

31:45.680 --> 31:50.240
even maybe leveling up a little bit in their existing career?

31:50.240 --> 31:51.240
It's a great question, Skalk.

31:51.240 --> 31:57.280
And this is another one that has like, my thinking of this has evolved over time because,

31:57.280 --> 32:02.640
you know, having some operations background, I always believe like you just created a single

32:02.640 --> 32:04.800
process that worked for everybody, right?

32:04.800 --> 32:12.680
Like you just optimize the process for everyone and, you know, to your point, like we are

32:12.680 --> 32:17.280
all unique complex beings, right?

32:17.280 --> 32:26.800
And the process I define for you may not serve someone else.

32:26.800 --> 32:31.960
So there's a couple of principles that I'm working with now.

32:31.960 --> 32:40.000
And the first is really like asking people just the question of like, what would your

32:40.000 --> 32:45.920
job search or career discovery look like if it were fun?

32:45.920 --> 32:54.800
Like allowing people to connect to like, if I were to actually turn this into an enjoyable

32:54.800 --> 33:00.120
thing, like what's the process I would create for myself?

33:00.120 --> 33:06.560
Because you alluded to something that I think is so, it limits so much of us.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.880
The system is built the way the system is built, right?

33:09.880 --> 33:13.960
From early education to higher education to corporate hiring, right?

33:13.960 --> 33:17.680
Like it is a series of constants.

33:17.680 --> 33:22.880
And I tell people like, be conscious of the fact that like, the system will always give

33:22.880 --> 33:26.160
you guidance to stay within the system, right?

33:26.160 --> 33:32.040
To be successful within the system, right?

33:32.040 --> 33:40.320
I think it's very helpful for you to think about like, if I were going to design a process

33:40.320 --> 33:46.520
that really felt fun and energizing for me to find a job, what would that look like?

33:46.520 --> 33:50.920
And that answer will be different for different people, but like, you know, I will give you

33:50.920 --> 33:55.200
some examples and some of these are people that I've directly worked with and some are

33:55.200 --> 33:58.480
just anecdotes that I've heard that I just absolutely love.

33:58.480 --> 34:04.440
But like, you know, the person who wants to work for a company and says, you know what

34:04.440 --> 34:05.440
I'm going to do?

34:05.440 --> 34:09.040
I'm going to understand what their client profile, their ideal client profile is.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.320
I'm going to go get them five clients.

34:11.320 --> 34:15.560
And then I'm going to go reach out to them and say, hey, I got you five clients.

34:15.560 --> 34:19.640
Would you be interested in having a conversation with me about working there?

34:19.640 --> 34:20.640
Right?

34:20.640 --> 34:25.640
And you know, that's a great example.

34:25.640 --> 34:32.360
A woman who I worked with, I encourage people to always start from a place of like, you

34:32.360 --> 34:37.000
know, envision a future you without constraints.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.280
Like before you say, I can't do that because I don't have this experience or I can't do

34:41.280 --> 34:47.040
that because I don't have the right network, like envision what is possible without constraints

34:47.040 --> 34:51.280
and then try to learn from people that are already kind of living that life.

34:51.280 --> 34:56.400
Like my favorite thing, you know, my favorite kind of sentiment to share with people is

34:56.400 --> 35:00.640
like there are eight billion people in the world.

35:00.640 --> 35:05.160
There is an excellent chance that there's at least one person that is kind of living

35:05.160 --> 35:08.560
the life, you know, that you want.

35:08.560 --> 35:14.520
And also most likely there is a person that has started from a place very similar to the

35:14.520 --> 35:18.920
place that you're in.

35:18.920 --> 35:26.600
And I say that just to say like, you can create any opportunity for yourself that you want.

35:26.600 --> 35:31.560
But once you've done that envisioning, like the most important thing for me has been connect

35:31.560 --> 35:37.880
with people that are doing the work you think you want to do.

35:37.880 --> 35:47.720
And for some people that is, you know, people that like building or creating, it's creating

35:47.720 --> 35:52.360
something for someone and saying, hey, I want to share this with you, maybe it'll be helpful

35:52.360 --> 35:57.880
to you in your work, like as a way to connect with that person.

35:57.880 --> 36:03.800
I know other people that like, they just go in with curious mind, like I just want to

36:03.800 --> 36:11.040
learn about you, your journey, your goals, your challenges.

36:11.040 --> 36:16.520
And most people are happy to share that, especially, and this is a lesson that I learned the hard

36:16.520 --> 36:20.120
way and you alluded to this a little bit.

36:20.120 --> 36:26.920
We start, we usually start from a place of I have to sell myself.

36:26.920 --> 36:31.560
And I tell people, you don't have to sell yourself initially.

36:31.560 --> 36:37.720
All you have to do is say, hey, can you, I am trying to understand more about this thing

36:37.720 --> 36:40.240
I think I want to do.

36:40.240 --> 36:44.300
Can you help me to understand the thing better?

36:44.300 --> 36:49.520
And then this is where like, as you develop those relationships, those are the people

36:49.520 --> 36:53.940
that can tell you if you're like, all right, now I'm sure this is what I want to do.

36:53.940 --> 36:57.760
How do I position myself to do this work?

36:57.760 --> 37:01.680
Those people that already have those jobs are the best resource to tell you how to get

37:01.680 --> 37:03.840
them, right?

37:03.840 --> 37:06.440
But you don't have to start from a place of selling.

37:06.440 --> 37:12.200
You just have to start from a place of curiosity.

37:12.200 --> 37:17.920
And believe it or not, and this was very helpful for me when I started CareerEdge, like I picked

37:17.920 --> 37:22.800
people that I was like, hey, you represent what I think I want this to be.

37:22.800 --> 37:27.040
And like that helped me start to build the early roadmap of CareerEdge because I could

37:27.040 --> 37:31.000
see the moves that these people were making and how they were making them.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.200
Yeah, that's great.

37:33.200 --> 37:39.560
Yeah, I think that's one of the things that I wanted to do with this whole community,

37:39.560 --> 37:45.240
especially the async kind of like discord server with the community.

37:45.240 --> 37:49.160
And it's still a little bit missing, but there's some folks starting to trickle in now because

37:49.160 --> 37:55.000
I do want people there that is already in this industry or in this career so that people

37:55.000 --> 37:56.240
can talk to them.

37:56.240 --> 38:02.040
And I think people always think I should only ask them technical questions, like I should

38:02.040 --> 38:07.640
only come to them, to my mentor, so to speak, when there's a piece of code that doesn't

38:07.640 --> 38:13.800
work or when I don't understand a technical thing where it's like, sure, that's good,

38:13.800 --> 38:16.880
but there's more to it than just the code.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.720
And you should ask about those things too.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.480
It's like, what do you do on a daily basis?

38:21.480 --> 38:27.560
Because a lot of people have a complete misconception of what it is to write code.

38:27.560 --> 38:31.920
People see movies and they see people typing super fast on their keyboards all day.

38:31.920 --> 38:37.320
And it's like, more often than not, that's actually a small part of your day.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.560
There's a lot of engagement with other people.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.720
There's a lot of talking through problems.

38:42.720 --> 38:47.560
There's a lot of being able to see other people's perspectives, other people's points of view

38:47.560 --> 38:52.320
and being able to disagree in a civil manner.

38:52.320 --> 38:58.920
And sometimes also admitting that maybe you were wrong, which is hard.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.520
But we need to be able to do that.

39:01.520 --> 39:06.560
And we need to be able to do that civilly so that it doesn't devolve the relationship

39:06.560 --> 39:10.240
within the company or within your team.

39:10.240 --> 39:13.840
So I think it's important to also talk about those topics.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.840
I think that's right.

39:14.840 --> 39:24.040
And I heard a great quote years ago that was, you can't be it if you can't see it.

39:24.040 --> 39:28.320
So if you haven't interacted with those kind of people, if you're not even aware of what

39:28.320 --> 39:35.040
else goes on within your company or with even in your team, you don't even know what questions

39:35.040 --> 39:37.000
to ask.

39:37.000 --> 39:46.880
And this is a place where I will say, I have found the fastest way to knowledge is a conversation

39:46.880 --> 39:49.800
with another human being.

39:49.800 --> 39:57.600
I spent years poring over articles and the most valuable insights I've gotten are when

39:57.600 --> 40:03.280
I've been face to face or on the phone with somebody and just said, tell me more about

40:03.280 --> 40:07.240
who you are, what you do and how you've been successful.

40:07.240 --> 40:12.720
Yeah, setting the right expectations as well.

40:12.720 --> 40:17.880
Because I think at the moment, there's a lot of good because people are aware that there's

40:17.880 --> 40:26.760
this big, well, it's a little different right now at this very moment in tech.

40:26.760 --> 40:35.320
But there was a point in the last six months to be here where a lot of places started educating

40:35.320 --> 40:41.000
people to get into tech because it was sold as this panacea, this solution to all the

40:41.000 --> 40:46.840
world's problems in terms of employment, in terms of everything.

40:46.840 --> 40:50.440
Now we're in a bit of a precarious situation with all these layoffs happening at these

40:50.440 --> 40:56.880
big, big companies that people have, if you work there, you might have felt a sense of

40:56.880 --> 41:05.000
job security and it's incredibly sad and I know people personally who's been affected

41:05.000 --> 41:11.960
by all of this stuff and it's hard, it doesn't matter where you live, it's still extremely

41:11.960 --> 41:18.240
disruptive to be told, sorry, but we're going to have to let you go.

41:18.240 --> 41:21.280
Because it's not something you planned on.

41:21.280 --> 41:26.240
You were coming into the office, doing your thing, you maybe even had plans for the rest

41:26.240 --> 41:34.040
of the year of what you'd like to accomplish and all of that is just, it's over, to rethink,

41:34.040 --> 41:36.960
it's time to rethink everything.

41:36.960 --> 41:43.680
So for some people it's worse than others, but I don't think it's easy for anybody when

41:43.680 --> 41:45.360
this happens to you.

41:45.360 --> 41:52.040
So I think there's a lot of support needed for these kinds of things, for these people

41:52.040 --> 41:59.240
going through this and I'm sure, I haven't brought this topic up yet with the people

41:59.240 --> 42:06.080
in the community, but I am sure there's quite a few folks that have put a lot on the line

42:06.080 --> 42:11.920
to change careers that's now maybe thinking that they've made the wrong choice and are

42:11.920 --> 42:16.360
in between a rock and a hard place because they might have given up a job where they

42:16.360 --> 42:21.600
had something to do something else only to find that the industry they thought was so

42:21.600 --> 42:27.440
secure and so lucrative is going through a really, really tough time.

42:27.440 --> 42:32.680
And so they might feel like, oh my goodness, what the heck do I do?

42:32.680 --> 42:39.340
So do you have any advice for these people, like how to stay motivated and stay focused

42:39.340 --> 42:43.800
when it might even feel like the world is collapsing around you?

42:43.800 --> 42:44.800
Yeah.

42:44.800 --> 42:50.120
I mean, my heart goes out to all of those people and every time I see those announcements,

42:50.120 --> 42:57.160
my heart sinks a little because I know, especially in places where you're like, I'm secure here,

42:57.160 --> 43:02.700
that quickly things can change and it's interesting.

43:02.700 --> 43:07.320
This is another area where my perspective has changed.

43:07.320 --> 43:16.400
The thing that I have learned is we can only control our own actions.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.480
External forces are external forces.

43:18.480 --> 43:21.560
We can't control them.

43:21.560 --> 43:31.000
The only thing we can control is how we react to those forces as well as decisions made

43:31.000 --> 43:34.400
in the past are made.

43:34.400 --> 43:39.120
Things that have happened in the past, those things cannot be changed.

43:39.120 --> 43:49.320
It is what we do today and tomorrow that we can control how we move differently.

43:49.320 --> 43:57.640
So the first thing I will say is, and this has been helpful for me in a lot of my transitions,

43:57.640 --> 44:00.640
you have to grieve the loss of the thing.

44:00.640 --> 44:04.080
You've lost something that's significant, right?

44:04.080 --> 44:09.800
Especially something that is the source of your livelihood.

44:09.800 --> 44:14.680
I think one of the things, when I was scared with managing emotions earlier in my life,

44:14.680 --> 44:21.640
it would be, what are all the unhealthy ways I can distract myself from this thing?

44:21.640 --> 44:26.060
There was no vice that was too good for me.

44:26.060 --> 44:32.800
Whatever I needed to do to suppress the feeling or ignore it or distract myself from it was

44:32.800 --> 44:40.680
where I invested my time, whereas the skill that I've really been cultivating more recently

44:40.680 --> 44:47.960
when these things come up is to actually feel them all the way through.

44:47.960 --> 44:51.400
I'll give a very specific example.

44:51.400 --> 45:02.400
When I started this most recent round of businesses, it was during COVID.

45:02.400 --> 45:09.600
We had a baby girl in May of 2021.

45:09.600 --> 45:15.720
The financial insecurity was not insignificant.

45:15.720 --> 45:23.440
One of the things, and my partner and I actually did this activity together, we're like, let's

45:23.440 --> 45:25.480
feel through losing everything.

45:25.480 --> 45:33.200
Because the thing that we're afraid of is that you're going to end up at a point where

45:33.200 --> 45:35.600
you can't survive.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.220
We felt through it.

45:37.220 --> 45:45.400
We felt through losing our jobs, we felt through losing savings, housing, all of these things.

45:45.400 --> 45:49.920
Yeah, it's hard to feel through all those things, but once you've felt through them,

45:49.920 --> 45:57.560
you realize you are so far from that ultimate outcome.

45:57.560 --> 46:03.880
Now that you have felt how terrible it could feel, it's not going to go away, but it's

46:03.880 --> 46:07.680
not going to have the same control over you.

46:07.680 --> 46:09.780
You can start to focus on the thing.

46:09.780 --> 46:13.880
We started to focus on the, all right, well, if those things do happen, what are things

46:13.880 --> 46:15.760
that we would do?

46:15.760 --> 46:19.320
What are places we could go and earn money easily?

46:19.320 --> 46:23.840
If we needed to ask for help, if we needed to find less expensive housing.

46:23.840 --> 46:26.760
We did this practical.

46:26.760 --> 46:27.760
What would we do?

46:27.760 --> 46:30.600
Then we were like, okay, that was enough.

46:30.600 --> 46:39.280
We grieved it, we strategized around it, but no, now let's focus on the big things we want

46:39.280 --> 46:43.600
to create for our future now.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.920
That's the first thing I'll say.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.680
Don't try to distract from it.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.460
Feel it all the way through.

46:49.460 --> 46:57.000
Feel through that worst case scenario so it doesn't have that kind of death grip on you.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.920
Then ask yourself, what can I do with this opportunity?

46:59.920 --> 47:01.520
What can I do with this time?

47:01.520 --> 47:07.200
I've seen so many people, Scott, that have actually taken the time to reconnect to a

47:07.200 --> 47:14.880
creative practice or just something that energizes and fulfills them.

47:14.880 --> 47:20.200
I think that is another simple first step.

47:20.200 --> 47:26.560
Don't feel the need to jump right into the next thing.

47:26.560 --> 47:30.560
If there is a need for financial security, the thing I always encourage people to do

47:30.560 --> 47:39.640
is look at what you need to live and ask yourself, how can I satisfy this for six to 12 months

47:39.640 --> 47:42.920
with the least amount of my time?

47:42.920 --> 47:51.960
I can really create space to nurture myself, do more purposeful exploration, and really

47:51.960 --> 48:02.800
find the next thing that's going to energize me and also sustain me financially.

48:02.800 --> 48:08.800
But I know, like I said, I've worked through recessions.

48:08.800 --> 48:13.800
I've been part of downsizing and it's just that it's going to happen and it's nothing

48:13.800 --> 48:15.640
you did.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.720
The thing you have control over is what you do next.

48:18.720 --> 48:19.720
Yeah.

48:19.720 --> 48:25.320
I mean, there's the flip side of that coin, which they call survivor's remorse.

48:25.320 --> 48:30.360
It's when you're the one that doesn't get let go and you're still at the company because

48:30.360 --> 48:40.520
one of the clients that I worked with in mid-2020, they had some big layoffs and so I wasn't

48:40.520 --> 48:45.320
affected by it, thankfully, and I know that me and some of my colleagues that I worked

48:45.320 --> 48:56.080
with there had that survivor's remorse, that thing where you feel kind of a little bad,

48:56.080 --> 48:57.080
especially if you've worked.

48:57.080 --> 49:00.640
Like some of the people that was affected, I've worked with them for years.

49:00.640 --> 49:05.000
I mean, some of these are my friends and they've been let go and I haven't been.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.560
So that's also something to not forget.

49:09.560 --> 49:13.120
Of all the people that has been let go, there's also a whole bunch of people that has not

49:13.120 --> 49:17.640
been let go at these companies who had to see their friends be affected like this and

49:17.640 --> 49:22.160
worrying about, are they going to be okay, are they going to find something?

49:22.160 --> 49:28.760
I mean, it's a tough time there, like the world is still recovering from COVID and we're

49:28.760 --> 49:29.760
not there yet.

49:29.760 --> 49:39.800
So opportunities aren't as plentiful as people would like to think or like to believe.

49:39.800 --> 49:42.160
So yeah, there's both sides to that coin.

49:42.160 --> 49:50.200
But I know when people are just going through this, the last thing you want is advice.

49:50.200 --> 49:53.200
You just want somebody to listen.

49:53.200 --> 49:59.000
But whenever people are ready, I think there's two videos on YouTube I recently stumbled

49:59.000 --> 50:01.080
upon that made an impact on me.

50:01.080 --> 50:04.240
The one is from the founder of Wired.

50:04.240 --> 50:08.480
He has this video, I think it's called 38 Pieces of Unsolicited Advice, something like

50:08.480 --> 50:09.480
that.

50:09.480 --> 50:13.360
And one of the things he said is very close to what you've just mentioned, where he said

50:13.360 --> 50:21.000
is when you're young, for six months to a year, live as frugally as you can.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.840
So that you know what it is, eat beans and rice, so that you know what that feels like,

50:25.840 --> 50:31.520
so that when you want to take a big chance in your life, you know what it is to be poor.

50:31.520 --> 50:36.760
And it will be, like you said, it will have less an effect on you because you know what

50:36.760 --> 50:40.040
worst case scenario potentially could be.

50:40.040 --> 50:47.200
And then the other one was a conversation on the Huberman Lab podcast with Dr. Elia

50:47.200 --> 50:48.200
Crum.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.620
And it's all about mindset.

50:50.620 --> 50:52.640
And that is just brilliant.

50:52.640 --> 51:00.160
It's just incredible the power that our minds have if we and the way we talk to ourselves

51:00.160 --> 51:05.560
and what we put out there and what we'd say when we look in the mirror in the morning.

51:05.560 --> 51:11.400
That is such a big impact on how we experience life in general that I think we should really

51:11.400 --> 51:17.440
take time to, like you say, make space for these things and not just be so focused on

51:17.440 --> 51:18.760
the next thing.

51:18.760 --> 51:26.320
So you've now touched on a topic in two points, Kalk, that I think is very important as it

51:26.320 --> 51:27.480
relates to all of this.

51:27.480 --> 51:32.360
You know, you talked about kind of communication, right, amongst peers and when you're talking

51:32.360 --> 51:38.840
to people and what intentional and attentive and listening communication looks like, but

51:38.840 --> 51:42.840
also how we communicate with ourselves.

51:42.840 --> 51:48.520
And one of the most transformative books that I have read in the last couple of years is

51:48.520 --> 51:54.680
a book called Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg.

51:54.680 --> 52:01.720
And I never felt that I was given, through all of my schooling, nobody ever said, like,

52:01.720 --> 52:07.400
here's how to intentionally communicate with yourself and others in a nonjudgmental and

52:07.400 --> 52:09.760
compassionate way.

52:09.760 --> 52:15.280
And I just, I've gifted this book dozens of times, I just sent another copy out today,

52:15.280 --> 52:20.120
because it gave me the ability to say, all right, this thing I'm feeling, even if it's

52:20.120 --> 52:26.000
a negative emotion, fear, anger, frustration, disappointment, whatever it is, there is a

52:26.000 --> 52:34.920
positive, like, intention around an unmet need that I have, like, it is doing something

52:34.920 --> 52:37.400
actually to protect me.

52:37.400 --> 52:42.600
I just need to actually give it, like, the attention that it deserves and not look at

52:42.600 --> 52:50.480
it as something to judge myself for, but something to explore, like, oh, I'm feeling frustrated

52:50.480 --> 52:57.040
because I needed, or I feel the need for stability, and now I don't have that stability.

52:57.040 --> 53:03.920
So what can I do to get to your point, like, to get that stability that I need to for this?

53:03.920 --> 53:10.400
But that book has given me the language not only to, like, be less judgmental as I talk

53:10.400 --> 53:16.800
to myself, but, like you alluded to earlier, also be able to have those conversations,

53:16.800 --> 53:21.760
especially in, you know, in work settings where disagreements come up or people have

53:21.760 --> 53:29.200
differing opinions, like, that book has kind of given me the playbook to just navigate

53:29.200 --> 53:38.840
those in a way that, quite candidly, like, feels more intentional and feels good, regardless

53:38.840 --> 53:44.640
of what the outcome of it is, like, now I can walk into situations and even if the other

53:44.640 --> 53:48.880
person's yelling at me, I'm okay, because I know I'm showing up the way I wanted to

53:48.880 --> 53:54.440
show up and I'm acknowledging their feelings and all of those things, so I share that as

53:54.440 --> 53:59.640
another resource, I think, that, like, is grounded in me, like, there are some basics

53:59.640 --> 54:06.240
here and communications with ourselves and others is, like, an important thing to, you

54:06.240 --> 54:08.120
know, to develop in ourselves.

54:08.120 --> 54:10.160
Yeah, for sure.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.280
I've heard about the book as well.

54:11.280 --> 54:15.120
I haven't read it yet, but it's definitely on my to-read list.

54:15.120 --> 54:18.720
I believe it's literally on my to-read list on Amazon.

54:18.720 --> 54:23.520
I just need to put it in the cart.

54:23.520 --> 54:30.000
So I alluded to earlier, like, where I kind of stumbled upon your video, the Monday pep

54:30.000 --> 54:36.040
talk on the Groove community and I think a lot of people that hear this might, Groove

54:36.040 --> 54:37.040
community?

54:37.040 --> 54:38.040
What's that?

54:38.040 --> 54:44.400
So I've been involved with them since the very, very beginnings and I've at some point

54:44.400 --> 54:51.880
I opened up their Slack and I've been really active there, more so than the app for various

54:51.880 --> 54:55.640
reasons, but don't need to go into that now.

54:55.640 --> 54:58.560
Nothing to do with the app or Groove.

54:58.560 --> 55:02.440
It's like personal situational things that is preventing me from using it as much as

55:02.440 --> 55:04.680
I'd like.

55:04.680 --> 55:15.400
And for you, what have you found in the Groove community and how would you, do you think,

55:15.400 --> 55:18.520
would you invite other people to join this community?

55:18.520 --> 55:22.120
What has it added to your life?

55:22.120 --> 55:23.880
Great question.

55:23.880 --> 55:31.800
Just to answer the, I have already referred, you know, dozens of people to it.

55:31.800 --> 55:38.480
It's important that I talk about my community journey because I, before Groove there was,

55:38.480 --> 55:44.080
and when I was first consulting on my own in Philadelphia, I was a member of like multiple

55:44.080 --> 55:49.200
co-working spaces, which for me was great on so many levels.

55:49.200 --> 55:52.840
Like it gave me access to multiple communities.

55:52.840 --> 55:55.660
I could be around value aligned people.

55:55.660 --> 55:59.160
Like it was awesome.

55:59.160 --> 56:04.960
So when the pandemic hit and like I had stopped working for the company I was working for,

56:04.960 --> 56:08.440
so like I no longer had my co-worker community.

56:08.440 --> 56:15.100
I no longer had, you know, co-working space communities.

56:15.100 --> 56:22.680
There was a physical co-working space in Philadelphia that stood up an online co-working community.

56:22.680 --> 56:24.960
It's called Indie Hall.

56:24.960 --> 56:32.120
And when I discovered Indie Hall, it gave me that thing that I was missing.

56:32.120 --> 56:37.400
They had a Discord channel and they had, they just had open co-working channels.

56:37.400 --> 56:41.120
So if you were working, you could just pop into a co-working channel.

56:41.120 --> 56:42.200
Other people could join in.

56:42.200 --> 56:46.320
You could share your video or not, but like it felt like you were in a room with other

56:46.320 --> 56:47.320
people.

56:47.320 --> 56:53.940
And I was like, I had no idea how badly I needed this thing until I found this thing.

56:53.940 --> 57:00.440
And then last year I was also introduced to Groove in the early days.

57:00.440 --> 57:05.200
And one of the things that I was struggling with at Indie Hall, especially as things started

57:05.200 --> 57:09.480
to open up physically, is like there were days where I'd be the only person in the virtual

57:09.480 --> 57:10.480
co-working room.

57:10.480 --> 57:15.080
And I was like, this would be better if like there was always people that were in there

57:15.080 --> 57:16.080
with me.

57:16.080 --> 57:19.840
So as soon as I got introduced to Groove, I was like, oh, wait a second.

57:19.840 --> 57:25.800
Like I don't want to say guaranteed, but like now the app is at a point, like at any point

57:25.800 --> 57:31.800
of the day, because it is a global community, if I go in there, I'm going to find at least

57:31.800 --> 57:37.480
one person to work with, if not like three others.

57:37.480 --> 57:42.720
And the thing that I have realized, especially through this journey of working for myself

57:42.720 --> 57:50.120
and not being in an office anymore and not being, I need that connection desperately

57:50.120 --> 57:52.120
in my day.

57:52.120 --> 57:59.520
I need it for accountability, I need it just for the human interaction component.

57:59.520 --> 58:05.520
And Groove does a lot of things really, really well.

58:05.520 --> 58:12.880
And just for quick background, there are 50 minute sessions where you get matched up with

58:12.880 --> 58:15.920
up to three other people.

58:15.920 --> 58:20.920
You have a couple minutes to share what you're working on, and then you start work.

58:20.920 --> 58:26.720
The timer starts for 50 minutes, everybody's cameras go off and there's just a chat window.

58:26.720 --> 58:30.180
And then you come back after 50 minutes and share what you've worked on.

58:30.180 --> 58:37.440
So it has given me that human connection that I was needing kind of desperately.

58:37.440 --> 58:40.760
It's given me the accountability.

58:40.760 --> 58:48.040
It has also given me a tremendous amount of grace and compassion for myself, because there

58:48.040 --> 58:52.680
are a lot of just good value aligned people on the platform.

58:52.680 --> 58:57.280
And I can't tell you how many grooves I'm on a day where a person is like, here's what

58:57.280 --> 59:02.440
I'm gonna do during this groove and then they come back on and they're like, so I got distracted.

59:02.440 --> 59:05.800
And that is something I joke to people all the time.

59:05.800 --> 59:09.840
It was such a gift because you're like, all right, I'm here for 50 minutes, I have to

59:09.840 --> 59:11.200
get all of this stuff done.

59:11.200 --> 59:17.720
And people are like, yeah, I felt the need to clean the dishes and then pet the dog.

59:17.720 --> 59:19.520
And then I sent them.

59:19.520 --> 59:25.920
But it also gave me this very just reminder that we need to show ourselves and one another

59:25.920 --> 59:27.400
grace and compassion.

59:27.400 --> 59:39.480
So I joke that it is a human connection app that is masquerading as a productivity app.

59:39.480 --> 59:44.240
Because I feel like it gives you so much more than just that.

59:44.240 --> 59:48.160
Yeah, that's a very good description of it.

59:48.160 --> 59:49.400
I love that.

59:49.400 --> 59:59.900
And I have to say, as a introvert myself, I would go so far as to say to other introverts,

59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.840
you need more human connection than you think you do.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.800
Oftentimes the story out there is that if you're an introvert, people drain your energy.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:16.600
And while that's true to some extent, not having any is definitely detrimental to your

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.460
mental well-being.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:25.760
So even if you see yourself as an introvert, I'd still encourage you to give these networks.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.480
Maybe it's Groove, maybe it's something else.

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.480
Give it a try, because you'd be surprised how energized you feel after you've had that

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480
human connection.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.840
I mean, you can limit it to the number of grooves that you feel comfortable doing in

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840
a day.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:42.160
There's no obligation to join one off to the other off to the other.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.220
If one is enough for you to get the energy that you need, that's great.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:53.440
Maybe the person on the other side of that screen also just needed that one thing that

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.440
day.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.800
So yeah, I definitely encourage people, even if you're an introvert, give it a shot.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.400
It might do more for you than you think.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.400
I love that, Skulk.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:07.200
And I'll add to that, you can test lots of communities.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.320
Sometimes you're not going to find the community that meets you where you are on the first

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320
try.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:19.960
One of my friend's expressions, which I like, is just find your weirdos.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.920
There's a group of people that you can connect with out there.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920
They exist.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.800
You just need to find them.

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:33.720
I feel like there's places like Discord and Reddit where niche groups are popping up.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:41.320
To your point, we do all need that connection and we can find it with people that get us

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:44.200
just as we are, right?

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.720
We don't have to be or do anything different.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.840
We can just show up as we are and there's communities that will fully accept us that

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840
way.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.840
We just have to find them.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.560
Yeah, that's very, very true.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.680
Well said.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.820
So I have one question left, but I have another question that's popped into my head while

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:07.040
I was watching you on camera, because there's a Venn diagram on your wall.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:12.040
And I'm curious what that Venn diagram is about, if you can share.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040
Yeah.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:20.520
It was by a local artist here in Philly and it's just daytime, nighttime, and the middle

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.960
of the Venn diagram is best time.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.400
Gotcha.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:35.880
So yeah, it's just that space in between your day and your night that is the middle of the

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.280
diagram.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280
Yeah.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.880
For me, the nighttime would be the big overlap.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.320
I'm definitely a night owl.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:51.080
I fought against it, but like so many things in life, it's best to play to your strengths

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:57.920
and not try to change because the world isn't necessarily set up for how you work best.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:04.920
There's always ways to find loopholes, find workarounds that you can make the wall a little

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:12.160
bit more welcoming, I don't know if that's the right word, but twist the world to work

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.760
with you instead of trying to change yourself to fit the world.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.120
I think that's what I was trying to say.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.440
Harmony is the word that's been coming up in a lot of conversations recently, right?

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:28.720
You're just trying to find your place in the world that kind of feels harmonious for you.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.280
It may not exist in all of those existing structures that you've been around, it doesn't

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.040
mean it doesn't exist at all, right?

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.560
Yeah, for sure.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.560
Yeah.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:45.320
So in closing, this has been wonderful, a question that I like to throw in every now

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:51.560
and again because it's a tough one, but I think once people think about it a little

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.400
bit, beautiful things come from it.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:02.840
So what is the best advice you've received in your life so far?

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.360
This is one, when you shared it at Skulk ahead of time, I was like, oh man, this is a tough

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:21.640
one for me to answer with a single response and I've been realizing I'm trying to be much

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:30.040
more attentive to answering the prompts because I've noticed my ability to not answer the

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:38.600
direct question, so the best advice I have received in your life, so I've really received

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:54.640
in my life so far is...

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:08.620
I think this is gonna go back to my earlier point around focus on how you wanna feel first.

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:15.580
Being someone that struggled with anger and frustration previously in my life, I went

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:23.960
into last year and my single target feeling was a feeling of peace and I reminded myself

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:33.160
of that every single day and despite a year that had plenty of ups and downs, I felt largely

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:39.120
at peace all of last year and I think that was just attributed to saying this is how

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:45.760
I wanna feel and I'm gonna remind myself every day that even if I am in situations that are

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:51.320
not peaceful, it doesn't mean I can't show up in a peaceful and intentional way.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:58.800
Yeah, that's beautiful, that makes me think of what story Thich Nhat Hanh, I don't know

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:04.880
if it's a story or if it's just something he's been known to quote and he's like, if

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:12.000
you're on a boat and the sea is rough, it only takes one person to stay calm to ensure

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.720
that the boat doesn't capsize, so maybe you can be that one person when life's chaotic

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:24.520
that just brings a little bit of peace and then it spreads and before you know it, everybody

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.400
is a little bit more peaceful.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.080
Thank you so much, Matthew, this has been beautiful, it's been lovely.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:36.120
I'm so glad I asked you, I knew this was gonna be a good conversation.

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.800
Thank you so much for joining.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:44.680
Thank you again for the opportunity, Skalk, I've really, I've enjoyed it, I'm also, story

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:51.440
for another time, but I love a career that is a mosaic like my own, so we'll have to

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.240
find time, I'd love to hear more about your journey as well and the last thing I'll end

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:02.680
on is like, the thing I love to do is have these conversations with people and like I'm

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:08.200
willing to invest time in people regardless of where they are, so if there's anything

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:14.600

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.600

I mean that so sincerely, like it's important, it's important to me to kind of support people

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:30.160
regardless of where they are on their journeys, so just please take it as an open invitation.
