00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,760
a podcast all about early stage web developers and

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,560
the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,360
Today, we are joined by Soham Shah,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,840
a software engineer based out of India,

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,480
a front-end developer who plays around with React,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,600
Next, JavaScript on a daily basis,

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,160
also an open-source contributor,

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,600
and I've been a Linux Foundation mentee,

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,200
and has served as a collaborator at Chakra UI in the past.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,800
Welcome, Soham.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,720
Hi. Yeah, thank you for having me at the podcast.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,560
It's really great that you are

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,920
doing so amazing stuff for the community, so yeah.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,480
It's my pleasure. So I think to get this started off,

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,560
maybe tell me where you're currently at,

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,240
and fun fact about yourself.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,840
Yeah, sure. So currently,

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm working as a software engineer at Marvin,

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,200
and my major work revolves around React and the JavaScript frameworks.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,520
So currently, I am having alignment towards the front-end side,

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,400
but I'm passionate about software engineering in general.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,640
So yeah, that is what I do on a daily basis.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, fun fact could be like I am

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,040
a sucker for the programming tease and the swags,

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,800
like I have them a lot.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,040
Like I can show like I'm having

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,480
programming code written on my T-shirt right now as well.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,640
So yeah, I just love these coding and the nerdy stuff. So yeah.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
I'm a sucker for that too.

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,680
I completely understand.

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,120
So it seems like you're really involved in the open source world,

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,600
and I actually know about you from your contributions to MDN.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,760
So can you maybe tell us a few words about your open source experience?

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,120
Yeah. So open source has been one of

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,640
the parts where I got the confidence into what I'm learning.

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,680
So generally, when you are learning something,

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,920
you need to implement.

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,040
So there are a lot of things that open source has helped me.

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,440
Again, one of the major things that I found is the mentorship part,

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,000
because everyone who has written this code,

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,320
if we are contributing,

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,000
then our quality is evaluated and reviewed.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,800
So that is something that I have got a lot of learning from that.

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,880
So even what PR I made at MDN,

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,800
that just small thing,

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,400
I still remember what I wrote.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,960
It was related to this screen reader visibility.

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,240
So I still remember that,

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,000
and whenever I write code for that,

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,080
I remember what fundamentals that you need to follow.

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,600
So also like at Chakra UI,

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,640
I had a good opportunity to do the issue triaging.

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,680
So that was also something that I could understand this large code base,

55
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
and everyone is so helpful.

56
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:22,200
So I feel very blessed even specifically as a very new into this space,

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,640
everyone is so much supportive and that mentorship part has a lot much on me.

58
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,280
So that is one thing that I have particularly loved about open source.

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,080
Apart from that, you build a very good network with the folks.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,840
So that is what I have truly enjoyed.

61
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,720
We used to have a long,

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,920
long just chitchatting with the contributors and the collaborators,

63
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,480
just knowing each other.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,480
So that was also something that you don't really just do work.

65
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,680
You also do something that connects you.

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,040
So the open source is for everyone,

67
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,800
and whatever the technologies,

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
whatever things are being built,

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,680
they are all indebted to open source.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,080
So even small contribution is making such big impact,

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,480
and that is also something that excites you to write more and more better code,

72
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,080
or it could be more contributions whenever you are available.

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,640
So yeah, that's my personal alignment to open source.

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,400
Now that you've been active,

75
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,600
you've been active down the software industry for a while.

76
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,840
But maybe you can tell us a little bit about your background

77
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,400
and what made you decide to get involved in this industry in the first place.

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah. So if I talk about my high school,

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,800
so I was a science student,

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
so there were a lot of options for me.

81
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,360
I chose software engineering because that was

82
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,400
the best option that I could get because what I have seen,

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,920
it has a lot of opportunities.

84
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,920
You can literally go into a lot of areas,

85
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,760
and that too involves a lot of research as well.

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,920
If you're into research,

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,480
if you're into doing something new,

88
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,120
then AI and everything are there which are under aggressive research.

89
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,560
Today, like blockchain and the other metaverse technologies

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,000
are there for a lot of research.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,560
So that was my reason for choosing software engineering,

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,240
but I was literally clueless.

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,600
I was just going to college and coming back,

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,560
doing those assignments and all.

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,000
But I always had that fear that,

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,240
will I be able to go at a really good company?

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,400
So that phase of mine where I was just in the bubble of my college and that small network,

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,560
I had that competitive mindset that,

99
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,280
okay, this person is doing better than me,

100
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,920
so will I be able to do even better?

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,760
So that competitive mindset actually was inside me that,

102
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,920
am I doing better?

103
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,320
Even I used to see more GitHub contributions,

104
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,440
I used to get that envy feeling that,

105
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,920
will I be able to get that?

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,400
I was always having that fear under my head that,

107
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,720
what after college?

108
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,400
What after my graduation?

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
Everything was that.

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,960
Then I decided, okay,

111
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,360
let's not get into this mindset and let's come out and see what

112
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,880
the other people are doing on the Internet.

113
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,480
Then slowly and gradually,

114
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,600
I started joining this Discord servers of different communities.

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,720
I joined this React Flux,

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,440
which is very popular where you see job posting,

117
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
where you see different questions.

118
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,240
So that was something I saw people are just helping out.

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,520
You are just asking a question and a lot of people who are

120
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,520
very popular people in the maintainer and open source world,

121
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,920
they are helping to solve even small, small bugs.

122
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,680
So that made me realize that,

123
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,400
okay, it is not that you are into competition,

124
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,200
but there I learned the importance like open source fundamental,

125
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,240
that it is about collaboration first and code second mindset.

126
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,720
So that actually made me understand,

127
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,040
okay, there is a lot more to it.

128
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,480
Then I first stepped into machine learning side of things.

129
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:33,200
So I did a lot of learning on that side and I really enjoyed it.

130
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,360
But after a certain point,

131
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,720
I was getting into proper research.

132
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
But then due to some reason,

133
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,880
my friend just told me like,

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,840
you can try web development.

135
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,200
I'm doing this. So it was sort of a freelance work.

136
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,600
So I did that and I really enjoyed it.

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,520
I didn't know that CSS could be this interesting.

138
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,480
Generally, it is a mindset that when you start learning,

139
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,880
then you have to do it.

140
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,480
So CSS was challenging,

141
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,360
but also interesting at the same time.

142
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,280
So I was getting that alignment.

143
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,920
Then I saw web development has,

144
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,720
if we see on a larger scale,

145
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
it has a lot of job opportunities.

146
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,720
Plus, I found out that my software engineering fundamentals

147
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,480
are clearly seen practical in that part more,

148
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,480
compared to what I was doing in other side.

149
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,520
For example, if I say client server architecture,

150
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,640
that is one main paradigm of software engineering.

151
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,680
So I could see that in practice in web development.

152
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,760
So that just gave me that kick.

153
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,280
Plus, one thing that you can build stuff.

154
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,840
So you can even build small application

155
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,160
for your day-to-day real usage.

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,280
So that actually gave me that confidence.

157
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,360
At that point, I realized that I can switch

158
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,480
my focus and attention to just one thing,

159
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
at least for now, I can go with web development.

160
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
It is not confined to just this field,

161
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,360
but I will do this.

162
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,800
So in AI, I did some research and review papers as well.

163
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,920
But I decided that this is not going to be,

164
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,880
at least for now, this is not going to be my career path.

165
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,560
And I started learning JavaScript.

166
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,280
I started learning React and all.

167
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:39,400
So this was my way I divide the trajectory.

168
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,760
Basically, I got into web development.

169
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,120
And then I started just being involved in the community.

170
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,080
So by that, I learned a lot of things.

171
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,280
That's very interesting.

172
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Yeah.

173
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,640
And so throughout this whole process

174
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,120
of learning and experimenting and kind of switching even,

175
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,480
switching careers, if you want to call it,

176
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,520
what have you found the most challenging about the industry

177
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,640
and about learning?

178
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,160
OK.

179
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,680
I guess the most challenging part is the start point,

180
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,400
the head start.

181
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,360
So when I was just into web development,

182
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,760
so first thing that I faced was the tutorial hell.

183
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,400
Anyone who is into just starting out any technology,

184
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,560
if one just sees the YouTube videos

185
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,040
and just do the line by line implementation,

186
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
then the learning is actually cut off.

187
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,040
And that is just literally you are getting that fake dopamine

188
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
hit that you have made something.

189
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,600
But that is actually that is just

190
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
you are doing from YouTube video.

191
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,160
So that I did for a long time.

192
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,360
I used to watch like, OK, I want to learn, for example, React

193
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,160
table, right?

194
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,440
I want to learn table stuff on React.

195
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,400
So I used to watch that whole video.

196
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,520
In reality, it should be I should read the documentation

197
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,040
or I should read blogs.

198
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,160
So this was a big, big issue.

199
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,600
I used to spend hours and hours of watching videos,

200
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,080
even the different courses on Udemy and all.

201
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,120
I took them.

202
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
And I was just watching and watching

203
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,080
and very less implementation was there and very less mind

204
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,880
I was putting into it.

205
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,880
So that actually was a big challenge.

206
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,800
Even in machine learning, I realized

207
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,440
that what I was doing previously was just

208
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,600
like looking at different YouTube videos

209
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,400
or Udemy or different courses.

210
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,560
And then I was just coding it out on my ID

211
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,160
and just making the output come.

212
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,080
But I feel that this is actually not the right way to learn.

213
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,600
So then I realized that I should focus.

214
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,560
I should pressure myself a little bit

215
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,280
that I go to these documentation sites or the blog sites

216
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,800
or even if I'm watching a tutorial video,

217
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,520
I should be mindful that I am using my own brain

218
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,760
to make something, giving things time.

219
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,600
So then this was a big challenge for me at least.

220
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,840
Like I spent more than four months

221
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,960
and even I got internship with that particular knowledge

222
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,200
that I was doing.

223
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,080
But even after the internship, I realized that I still

224
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,680
lack the fundamentals.

225
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,520
So this was something very insightful.

226
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,160
And then I came across a boot camp called Neoji Camp.

227
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
So this web development boot camp actually

228
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,440
helped me a lot in my career.

229
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,280
What I have learned from there, the community and everything,

230
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:56,280
I am totally indebted to what I have learned in that boot camp.

231
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,920
So there can be any different sort of these resources.

232
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,520
But the idea is that even there you

233
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,920
do this tutorial copy pasting or this type of thing,

234
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,600
then again, that would be an issue.

235
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,080
So yeah, one idea that I have followed that first thing

236
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,600
that I have to do is think by my mind,

237
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,960
then go to documentation, understand it thoroughly.

238
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,360
And then if I'm getting nothing, then I

239
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,720
go to maybe just the YouTube video and just quickly see.

240
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,920
But it is not that follow that thing.

241
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,360
So yeah, that was a little bit thing

242
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,400
I could share about my experience.

243
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Yeah, that's interesting.

244
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,360
Yeah, I think for myself also, what I have found

245
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,920
is I find it hard to learn something

246
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,320
if I don't have anywhere to use it in the moment,

247
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,800
if you know what I mean.

248
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,040
So I find if I can think of a need,

249
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,280
like the way they say scratching your own itch, that thing.

250
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,600
So I think of an idea, and I'm like, OK, cool.

251
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,520
So I have this idea.

252
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,560
So what technologies are out there that I'd like to learn?

253
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,240
And then I would pick one of these technologies

254
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,120
that I'm not as familiar with.

255
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
And I would learn it and use it to build this thing

256
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,920
that I didn't want to build for myself.

257
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,680
I kind of feel like that is a better way for me

258
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,480
personally of learning, other than just building yet another

259
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,080
to-do application or something like that.

260
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,040
That is very spot on.

261
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,320
The one which you mentioned, the way

262
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,600
to go is understanding the problem

263
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,680
and then searching for the available solutions,

264
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,200
implemented solution in the market.

265
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,000
For example, if I had to implement a graph library,

266
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,320
I won't be going to a tutorial where the guy uses a graph

267
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,040
library.

268
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,560
But it would be like what my design says,

269
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,120
what my future product requirement says,

270
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,760
or what I have at least imagined for my project

271
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,600
that I would be implementing this stuff in my graph.

272
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,760
And then I see different options,

273
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,320
like how do you go for shopping?

274
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,520
It is exactly like that.

275
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,560
You see different things that are similar for your use case,

276
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
but you choose whatever fits your need,

277
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
not what the shopkeeper gives us.

278
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,400
So that is the idea that I feel everywhere I have seen.

279
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,920
In fact, when my professional thing started,

280
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,320
we had to write these design documents

281
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,360
for different implementations.

282
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,240
So we used to research on various options

283
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,400
and the library which we want to introduce.

284
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,080
So because that takes up the bundle size,

285
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:00,280
so the practice should be very mindful about the feature

286
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,120
and not the technology.

287
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,200
I agree 100%.

288
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,240
Yeah.

289
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,400
So you've mentioned a couple of resources,

290
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,800
but if you had to pull together a couple of things

291
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,080
that you found particularly useful up to now,

292
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,640
what are those resources?

293
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,840
Right.

294
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,720
For resource, I would say that first thing

295
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,240
that the best resource, I would say,

296
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,960
is the MDN documentation, at least for web development.

297
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,760
That is the way that should come into practice.

298
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,120
Even if it is difficult for one as a beginner,

299
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,800
still it is something that you need to get used to it,

300
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,880
at least the starting part.

301
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,200
Because all other resources are sort

302
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,320
of an extract from this resource only.

303
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,360
So not just this, but the very source of truth,

304
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,440
in the community, I guess it is the MDN docs.

305
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,720
So other resources are an extract of this.

306
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,080
So one thing that if you need anything,

307
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,920
then this is going to be your source of truth.

308
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,000
You can quote it.

309
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,400
It is given at MDN.

310
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,320
So there is a high possibility that we

311
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,600
need to just reconsider our belief about XYZ thing

312
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,240
that we are knowing about JavaScript or web in general.

313
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,000
But apart from this, the fundamentals

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,920
should be very, very clear about any language.

315
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,280
This I have realized when I got some challenging work.

316
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,880
So on building simple Figma screens,

317
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,560
implementation into code is very simple.

318
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,920
We can just make some CSS changes

319
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,640
and just make the thing work.

320
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,920
But when there is complexity, when

321
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,600
there is making things as scale, or any more complexity

322
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,200
will be introduced, then you will realize, OK,

323
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,760
this concept should be known.

324
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Else, on a longer run, the code will be spaghetti.

325
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,560
So that concept, JavaScript React concepts

326
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,000
are very important.

327
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,640
So I would say JavaScript.info is the website

328
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,040
that I have admired a lot.

329
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,520
They have put everything so much structured and nicely

330
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,240
with very good example.

331
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,960
So for a beginner, this is the resource.

332
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,000
Even it has helped a lot in interviews

333
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,040
where you have to crisp.

334
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,480
You want crisp info.

335
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,600
So JavaScript info is very good for beginners.

336
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,840
Apart from that, there is a YouTube playlist

337
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,640
called Namaste JS, which is by Akshay Saini.

338
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,080
So he also explains the JavaScript concepts and all

339
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,640
in very, very good depth.

340
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,920
And also, one thing that I realized,

341
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,720
that even if you are doing that tutorial healthing in this

342
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,840
as well, it applies the same.

343
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480
So this resource is also good.

344
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,400
But if you're not implementing, then it

345
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,880
is, again, the same story.

346
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,360
But the reason why I love this playlist or the videos

347
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,040
of Namaste JavaScript is the way that is being explained

348
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,800
is from the core, so that I particularly like.

349
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,720
It is not just syntax, but it is how it works on the behind.

350
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,600
So yeah.

351
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,880
But apart from that, if you really

352
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,040
want to work on particular things like Next.js or Webpack

353
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
or something like that, then there

354
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,120
is Frontend Master's course, which are pretty good.

355
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
I got it from GitHub pack.

356
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,000
So if you are a student, then definitely you

357
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,920
should exercise your GitHub student pack

358
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,600
and get Frontend Master's, or else you can buy as well.

359
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,520
But Frontend Master's course are really, really quality courses.

360
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,040
So definitely, I would consider buying or even

361
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,560
for resource or for the learning.

362
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,800
So yeah, you just need to search the right things,

363
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,840
and Google will make the SEO work for you.

364
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,800
So just like searching, keep building, SEO will work.

365
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,400
Yeah.

366
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,360
Yeah, I have to agree.

367
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,080
Frontend Master's is really good.

368
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,960
I use that as well.

369
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,200
So you've mentioned a whole bunch of resources,

370
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,360
and they sound great.

371
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,560
But I'm wondering, what do you find missing or stuff

372
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,760
that can be improved?

373
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,640
OK, in these resources, one thing

374
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,320
that if we see blog-based resource, for example,

375
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,520
JavaScript Info, so if you just read those blogs

376
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,760
and just make the examples that they give,

377
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,040
you just implement them, then I guess it won't be enough.

378
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,880
So when you read a book, if you just read the whole book

379
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,840
without thinking or implementing about it,

380
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,120
then it won't make any sense.

381
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,640
So it is the same with JavaScript Info.

382
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,160
For example, if you have learned about closures.

383
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,400
But the ideal or a good way, I would say,

384
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,280
it won't be just stopping at that point.

385
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,840
You can just give yourself some time to digest.

386
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,360
Then you can look for other blogs available maybe

387
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,720
on Medium or Hashnode, these blogging websites,

388
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,680
and know how other concepts that you might have missed.

389
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,000
For example, the disadvantages of closures.

390
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,440
This is a topic that might have not

391
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,000
been covered at JavaScript Info.

392
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So you can just see.

393
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,320
So when you give yourself time to digest things,

394
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,360
then only it will actually fruit.

395
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,840
Else, you will forget.

396
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,800
If you read the whole JavaScript Info in one day,

397
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,360
then it won't result into anything.

398
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,000
So that is one thing that is being missing.

399
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,040
The other thing, I feel that they are lacking code.

400
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,280
They are not having enough code examples

401
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,880
that you need to become a master or at least a good level

402
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,040
at the particular technology.

403
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,640
Not pointing at any one, all the other resource

404
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,680
because they have limitation of number of examples

405
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,920
because they don't want that content to be very long.

406
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,960
So as a developer, what I used to do,

407
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,520
I used to Google JavaScript questions on closures.

408
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
There will be 10 different websites.

409
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
I just used to pick and put it on my GitHub repo

410
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,640
so I can refer them later.

411
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,440
So this is the way we can just compensate that

412
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,440
because code is everything, right?

413
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,480
Enough number of lines of text is not that much,

414
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,040
how much 10-liner code can explain.

415
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,920
So that's why code is something that you

416
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,400
need to have in abundance when you are learning.

417
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,880
And one thing that JavaScript Info example I gave, right?

418
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,080
So one thing I used to do with my friend,

419
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,000
we used to do pair learning.

420
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
So what we used to do, we used to pick

421
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:34,080
some topics of our interview questions, right?

422
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,440
JavaScript fundamental questions.

423
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
For example, it could be closures or promises.

424
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,360
We used to just divide amongst each other.

425
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,200
And then we used to explain those to each other.

426
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,400
And then we used to have discussions.

427
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,720
And we used to have debates.

428
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,640
And then we ran across Google and searched

429
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,440
what was the real right answer.

430
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,960
So those conversations, I feel they

431
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,480
were a lot more productive than anything else.

432
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,000
So the human connect is something different

433
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,960
that I have realized that when you

434
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,760
have friends who are into the same path you are going towards,

435
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,440
then it is very helpful.

436
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,120
And that is also a big, big benefit of being in a community.

437
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,560
You just text on Discord that, OK, I've learned this.

438
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,600
I want to explain that to anyone who wants to join.

439
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,360
Go on the channel and just start discussing, right?

440
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,160
So this is one thing that has helped me a lot in my interview

441
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,080
learning process.

442
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,000
And yeah, that is one fond memory.

443
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
And I also made very good friendship

444
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,600
with the bond as well.

445
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,240
That is really, really interesting.

446
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,080
I've never heard people say that before.

447
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,480
The specific having a debate and that whole thing,

448
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,680
that's super interesting.

449
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,640
And I can imagine that'll work really well.

450
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,800
I was just telling that we had a big, I guess,

451
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,280
one and a half hour debate on JavaScript is interpreted

452
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,880
language or a compiled language.

453
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,600
Because there is not exactly one stamp answer to that.

454
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
There are a lot of complexity on what perspective you are talking.

455
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,760
So that was a really amazing discussion.

456
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,840
So yeah, please go ahead.

457
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,600
No, no, thanks for sharing that.

458
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,360
That's really interesting.

459
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,160
So I was thinking, you've been through the interview process.

460
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,440
So what do you think about interviews in the tech industry?

461
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,680
It's a little scary, and maybe you think should be changed?

462
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,200
Or how do you think it can be improved?

463
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,240
Yeah, so one thing that I recently gave a lot of interviews.

464
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,280
So one thing that in common which I realized

465
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,480
that was a little bit of blocker was I was not even

466
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,280
having enough context of what I will be giving interview

467
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,080
for that, right?

468
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,280
So just an example.

469
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,480
So some companies like ask something very, very advanced

470
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,280
in the first round itself.

471
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,920
And some of them just ask basics.

472
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,280
Or even if we are doing for a front end role,

473
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,960
I was asked something very unexpected about system design.

474
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,320
So that is one thing that there should be a little bit clarity

475
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,800
upon what skills you will be assessed in a particular round.

476
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,400
So you are prepared.

477
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,480
For example, if I was asked about web performance, right?

478
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,320
But at that point, I was not remembering

479
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,040
what I learned about web performance,

480
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,200
at least at the time of the interview.

481
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
So I had to ask that, could you let me Google?

482
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,640
So they did let me, but what if they didn't?

483
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,440
So I was not remembering the names like FID or the terms.

484
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,320
So that could lead that I am not knowing.

485
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,880
But in reality, I was knowing.

486
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,120
I had learned about or experimented

487
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,720
about these things before.

488
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,000
So yeah, these type of things.

489
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,520
I was once asked like dynamic programming question.

490
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,640
So generally, I at least don't expect a lot of this

491
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,840
complex algorithm as a fresher into front end

492
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,960
that we are asked a lot more this typical data structure

493
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,800
algorithm question.

494
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,280
But even if they're coming, then I

495
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,800
should know that, OK, I should be prepared.

496
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,880
So this is one thing.

497
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,080
Else I have a feeling that for interviews,

498
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,120
if you are prepared enough, then things are very, very simple.

499
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,280
But it is not the case for every time and everyone.

500
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,640
Some people might be a little bit nervous

501
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,200
or that is into nature because that depends.

502
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,720
So for that, I feel that practice

503
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
is something that gives you confidence.

504
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,040
But we as a human, we need validation.

505
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,240
So even if I have solved 100 questions

506
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,080
and I practice a lot, but that is not validated by someone.

507
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,520
So I need someone to validate that, OK, I'm

508
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,320
at least ready to appear for interview.

509
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
So peers helped a lot.

510
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,800
I used to give mock interviews with my friends on Twitter.

511
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,800
So two, three people on Twitter helped me for mock interviews.

512
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,640
So even that person is not as equal experience as us,

513
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,200
but at least we can be confident that am I able to explain.

514
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,120
So that part I can add.

515
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:11,320
Apart from that, I always have that one sort of fear

516
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,600
that whatever I am knowing that in one interview,

517
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,760
I was asked, do you know CSS?

518
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,960
Then I literally had no answer.

519
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,120
If I say yes and that I'm asked very, very difficult

520
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,160
or in-depth question of CSS, then what will happen?

521
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,520
So that thing, I always am not sure

522
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,760
that how much in-depth knowledge you want or you

523
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,360
need for a particular role, because that is very variable.

524
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,800
So that was very, very.

525
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,640
And I've seen in interviews, you are asked yourself

526
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,120
to rate on some numbers, which I particularly find weird,

527
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,920
because I am generally asked, out of 10,

528
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,400
how much you rate yourself.

529
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,920
So I don't know how, because even if you are reactive,

530
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,120
you are not Dan Abramo, right?

531
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,160
So you don't know everything.

532
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,960
So you cannot tell you are above eight or nine.

533
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,400
So yeah, that sometimes.

534
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,240
But it's fine.

535
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,600
I don't think that is any issue.

536
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,920
That's just a way to see if you are confident enough.

537
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Yeah, I guess.

538
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,360
Yeah, yeah.

539
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,920
So just a pop quiz question.

540
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,240
Would you rather start your own business

541
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,560
or rather join a company?

542
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Yeah, this is actually a question

543
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,480
that I actually don't have any right answer, at least

544
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,520
for now, a little bit tricky for me.

545
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,760
But I really want to start my own business.

546
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,720
But the key is if I get the right idea or a product,

547
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,280
that particularly I believe in.

548
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,480
So if I want to do something and I

549
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,720
reach to that particular stage where I can actually

550
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,600
implement that, given that all the factors you need,

551
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,840
so then definitely I would go for my startup or something.

552
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,520
But apart from that, even anywhere I'm at,

553
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,120
if my work, whatever I'm doing is valued,

554
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,480
and if I'm satisfied at the end of the day,

555
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,520
then I guess that is really cool.

556
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,680
You are doing good at work.

557
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,160
And life is also, apart from work,

558
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,680
you want to do what you're passionate about, maybe

559
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,360
some hobby or something that you do for fun.

560
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,920
So that balance is also some people look for.

561
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,640
That is totally depending on person to person.

562
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,640
But I would like to also keep my hobbies as priority.

563
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,280
So I don't want to be super, super workaholic.

564
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,520
I also want to have the balance between both.

565
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,320
That's good.

566
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,520
And that leads nicely into the next question, which is,

567
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:12,560
what do you like to do when you don't code or learn to code?

568
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,840
So I would say I do different stuff.

569
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
I just try experimenting different things.

570
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,120
For example, sometimes I see my friends learning something.

571
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,320
I just ask, from where you are learning?

572
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,160
So recently, my friend was learning music and guitar

573
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,720
and stuff.

574
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,040
So I have an interest in singing.

575
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,200
I'm not a good singer.

576
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,520
But he explained me in more technical terms of music.

577
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,360
So I have been into that.

578
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,680
I love doing that.

579
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,520
Also, from this new year, Jan, I decided

580
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,840
I would focus more on my health as well.

581
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,040
So I've been doing yoga and meditation

582
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,640
and have continued that habit till now.

583
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,000
So that is also a win for me.

584
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,760
But I really enjoy doing yoga and all these things.

585
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,840
A lot good for mental health and peace.

586
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,320
So also for stretch and everything,

587
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,360
I really feel energetic throughout the day.

588
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,840
Apart from that, I'm having a very, not exactly hobby,

589
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,720
but I love experimenting with my habits.

590
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
So even small, small things, like you

591
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,280
refrain from something for one week.

592
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,520
Are you able to control yourself from doing that?

593
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,080
It could be as simple as not watching TV.

594
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,040
This is a habit, right?

595
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,280
You are challenging yourself that, OK,

596
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,600
I'm not going to do something.

597
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,560
It is more towards that part.

598
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:52,480
Are we not getting a lot much slaves of our own mind?

599
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,040
So that is an exercise that I like doing whenever I like.

600
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,960
So if you could recommend a single resource, that

601
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,440
could be a book, a course, YouTube channel, a community,

602
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,520
whatever, what would you recommend?

603
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,120
So for a book, I'm not much into reading self-help books,

604
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,040
first of all.

605
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,960
But I have read Atomic Habits.

606
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,000
So that was a really, really good book, if you implement.

607
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,280
So whatever is said in that book,

608
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,920
it has actually helped me a lot to think back

609
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,880
and on what I'm currently doing, what my habits are.

610
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,720
And that is where I have got this motivation

611
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,960
to try out different stuff and improve our habits.

612
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,360
So that is one book I would definitely

613
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,200
recommend to implement.

614
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,640
Apart from that, Neoji Camp Bootcamp

615
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:58,040
is something that has changed my trajectory about the career.

616
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,440
If I had not done that, if I had not got the community there

617
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,160
and the friends and the mentorship, everything there,

618
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,160
then I am not sure what I would have been doing.

619
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,960
But yeah, it is sort of very close to my heart.

620
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,520
And I am very indebted to that.

621
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,920
So you can check that out.

622
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,600
It is a very, very good cohort of learning web development.

623
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,520
So yeah, that is what I strongly recommend.

624
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,520
It is more about you learn together.

625
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,760
And also, they help you in placements as well.

626
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,880
If you intend to get a job, then they

627
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,400
help you with that as well.

628
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,960
So yeah, it has helped me a lot, so definitely.

629
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,000
But else, resources-wise, I guess if we see properly,

630
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,640
then we will find things around.

631
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,480
Just being connected with the community,

632
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
because people has a lot of stories to tell.

633
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,400
So if you connect with someone today,

634
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,760
that person will tell you his or her 10 resources.

635
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,280
And then you know a lot of things,

636
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,960
and then you can evaluate what fits best for you.

637
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,520
But that information comes by communicating.

638
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,640
So that is one thing that I would say as a resource,

639
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,920
I would say.

640
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,440
And apart from that, you asked about community.

641
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,040
So I told about Discord groups.

642
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,320
They are amazing.

643
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,800
Whenever you want to hang out, you should.

644
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,600
At least in the tech community, networking

645
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,200
is a very, very crucial part.

646
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,280
Because I have seen that directly applying

647
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,520
at a company's portal versus getting a referral

648
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,600
is a very big difference, and also not a referral.

649
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,000
But you can at least ask the person,

650
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,760
is the company really good?

651
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,080
Is it fitting your requirements?

652
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,520
So that's why networking is crucial in all different terms.

653
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,800
And yeah, I have been attending and being involved

654
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,920
with the meetup groups in my, like I have been involved

655
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,120
with React, the technology that I am interested in.

656
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,600
So there's React Bangalore, JavaScript Bangalore meetups.

657
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,320
So these are the meetup groups that I have been involved.

658
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,480
I've also given a couple of talks.

659
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,280
But overall, what I focus is on learning.

660
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,520
So yeah, tech meetup groups are definitely a place to go.

661
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,560
Sometimes some Saturday when you are free,

662
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,880
you should hop in to the live meetings, or talks,

663
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,560
or workshops, whatever you like.

664
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,200
Yeah, I 100% agree.

665
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,120
Community is super important.

666
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,360
So if you could nominate someone that you

667
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,080
think I should speak to on this podcast,

668
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,840
who would you nominate?

669
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,340
Right.

670
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,440
Yeah, first thing that I feel that you should definitely

671
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,480
talk with is Sage.

672
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,200
He is the creator of Chakra UI framework,

673
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,360
which is a very popular front-end framework.

674
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,800
So the reason, because I had been in the meetings

675
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,240
previously when I was involved with Chakra UI actively,

676
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,440
he is a very humble person and very knowledgeable, very expert

677
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,360
in this domain.

678
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,440
And I'm really inspired from what work he has put

679
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,440
and what things he does for the community.

680
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,280
So that is my nomination, if you would say that.

681
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,040
But Sage is the person that I would say.

682
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Apart from that, Johnny Berger, I'm not sure you know him.

683
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,080
I've seen him or not.

684
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,520
But he is a creator of Remotion.

685
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,120
And I have also made a couple of small contributions

686
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,960
and have been on the Discord.

687
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,000
So he's also a very passionate person

688
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,080
about open source and overall.

689
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,720
So yeah, definitely them.

690
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:11,760
And if you want to talk more about student-centric or

691
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,000
learner-centric side, so then I would

692
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,600
recommend that you can talk with Tanay Pratap.

693
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
He's the founder of Invact.

694
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,000
And he was also involved with NeojiCamp.

695
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,560
He used to help mentor us and teach us.

696
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,520
So yeah, definitely he's an amazing person

697
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,440
for the students.

698
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,600
And yeah, this is really, this can

699
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,840
be very helpful for anyone learning, getting started.

700
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,880
Yeah, those sound all like great people.

701
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,360
I'll definitely reach out to them.

702
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,960
So before we wrap this up, please tell us about any projects

703
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,960
you would like our audience to know about,

704
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,600
any work opportunities you're open to,

705
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:06,480
what kind you're interested in, and how people can contact you.

706
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,680
Yeah, sure.

707
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,120
So first thing, to be honest, I have

708
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,640
done a couple of projects and all.

709
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,960
But one project that has been very close to me

710
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:26,320
was the one that I did in December.

711
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,800
It was done in November.

712
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,440
So basically, it is a mock backend

713
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,920
for the front-end developers who are just

714
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,480
learning and making projects.

715
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,960
So it is just for learning purpose.

716
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,160
But the thing is, if you are making an e-commerce

717
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,360
application, so the problem is, if you just make the front-end,

718
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,280
if we are making just front-end and putting just dummy data,

719
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,840
then it is not making any use of the API call

720
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,720
or the client server thing.

721
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,840
Or if I want to do something complex,

722
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,720
if I want to call different APIs in sequence,

723
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,160
if I want to do something complex with the API calling,

724
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,680
I want to show loading states, stuff like that.

725
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,600
So how I will be able to do that?

726
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,240
And if I'm not doing, then real work of a front-end person

727
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,240
is not just making screens, but it is also

728
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,960
about state management or data, how data will be loaded,

729
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,880
and everything like that.

730
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,160
So for that, I built mock me.

731
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,640
So it gives different templates for different projects.

732
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,440
So there are more than eight, nine templates are there.

733
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,360
So for e-commerce or video library or social media

734
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,760
and all, so people are really using them

735
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,080
and finding it very helpful.

736
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,360
So we also built what problem we realized with the library

737
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,960
that we are using under mock me.

738
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,040
So it is a Mirage.js-based project.

739
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,600
So Mirage.js is a library for mocking the APIs.

740
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,760
But the problem with Mirage.js is you cannot do stuff

741
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,440
that you do with the real APIs.

742
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,320
You can go to Postman or some tool

743
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,720
and make the fetch call and see what is the response.

744
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,320
That you cannot do with that interface is not available to you

745
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,080
when you're doing with Mirage.js or the mock me sort of.

746
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,680
Not going into much technicalities,

747
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,720
but for this problem statement, we actually

748
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,160
built another sister project called mock man.

749
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,400
So basically, this is exactly same as Postman,

750
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,680
but Postman are some, I guess, the different tools

751
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,600
are available for API testing.

752
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,520
So exactly same, but for mock APIs.

753
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,280
So we built this for Mirage.js.

754
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,880
So that particular project is powering more than 2,000

755
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,320
active GitHub projects.

756
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,040
And overall, these mock me and different templates

757
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,440
are having, today, more than 18,000 downloads.

758
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,600
So yeah, that is most impactful project.

759
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,440
And people like DM me, put it on Twitter

760
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,960
that they are getting jobs because they

761
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,040
had it in their mock back end.

762
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,160
Because the interviewer can see the projects they

763
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,080
are having real functionality.

764
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,600
So yeah, my project has been on back end,

765
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,760
and it is helping people on the back end backstage side.

766
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,920
So I'm very happy and proud about this project.

767
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,760
But I really want to maintain it as well in the future.

768
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,840
That's very cool.

769
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,880
Yeah, thanks.

770
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,920
Very, very nice.

771
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,880
Well, thank you so much for joining me today, Saham.

772
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,560

And I wish you all of the best for the future,

774
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,320
and looking forward to see all the great things you build.

775
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,000
Yeah, thank you so much once again for having me.
