00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast,

00:03.720 --> 00:06.760
a podcast all about early stage web developers and

00:06.760 --> 00:09.560
the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.560 --> 00:12.360
Today, we are joined by Soham Shah,

00:12.360 --> 00:14.840
a software engineer based out of India,

00:14.840 --> 00:18.480
a front-end developer who plays around with React,

00:18.480 --> 00:21.600
Next, JavaScript on a daily basis,

00:21.600 --> 00:24.160
also an open-source contributor,

00:24.160 --> 00:27.600
and I've been a Linux Foundation mentee,

00:27.600 --> 00:32.200
and has served as a collaborator at Chakra UI in the past.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.800
Welcome, Soham.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.720
Hi. Yeah, thank you for having me at the podcast.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.560
It's really great that you are

00:40.560 --> 00:44.920
doing so amazing stuff for the community, so yeah.

00:44.920 --> 00:51.480
It's my pleasure. So I think to get this started off,

00:51.480 --> 00:54.560
maybe tell me where you're currently at,

00:54.560 --> 00:58.240
and fun fact about yourself.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.840
Yeah, sure. So currently,

01:01.840 --> 01:04.640
I'm working as a software engineer at Marvin,

01:04.640 --> 01:11.200
and my major work revolves around React and the JavaScript frameworks.

01:11.200 --> 01:16.520
So currently, I am having alignment towards the front-end side,

01:16.520 --> 01:19.400
but I'm passionate about software engineering in general.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.640
So yeah, that is what I do on a daily basis.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, fun fact could be like I am

01:27.000 --> 01:32.040
a sucker for the programming tease and the swags,

01:32.040 --> 01:33.800
like I have them a lot.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.040
Like I can show like I'm having

01:36.040 --> 01:39.480
programming code written on my T-shirt right now as well.

01:39.480 --> 01:46.640
So yeah, I just love these coding and the nerdy stuff. So yeah.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.640
I'm a sucker for that too.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.680
I completely understand.

01:50.680 --> 01:55.120
So it seems like you're really involved in the open source world,

01:55.120 --> 02:00.600
and I actually know about you from your contributions to MDN.

02:00.600 --> 02:06.760
So can you maybe tell us a few words about your open source experience?

02:06.760 --> 02:11.120
Yeah. So open source has been one of

02:11.120 --> 02:15.640
the parts where I got the confidence into what I'm learning.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.680
So generally, when you are learning something,

02:18.680 --> 02:19.920
you need to implement.

02:19.920 --> 02:24.040
So there are a lot of things that open source has helped me.

02:24.040 --> 02:28.440
Again, one of the major things that I found is the mentorship part,

02:28.440 --> 02:31.000
because everyone who has written this code,

02:31.000 --> 02:32.320
if we are contributing,

02:32.320 --> 02:37.000
then our quality is evaluated and reviewed.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.800
So that is something that I have got a lot of learning from that.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.880
So even what PR I made at MDN,

02:44.880 --> 02:46.800
that just small thing,

02:46.800 --> 02:49.400
I still remember what I wrote.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.960
It was related to this screen reader visibility.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.240
So I still remember that,

02:54.240 --> 02:57.000
and whenever I write code for that,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.080
I remember what fundamentals that you need to follow.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.600
So also like at Chakra UI,

03:03.600 --> 03:07.640
I had a good opportunity to do the issue triaging.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.680
So that was also something that I could understand this large code base,

03:11.680 --> 03:13.680
and everyone is so helpful.

03:13.680 --> 03:22.200
So I feel very blessed even specifically as a very new into this space,

03:22.200 --> 03:28.640
everyone is so much supportive and that mentorship part has a lot much on me.

03:28.640 --> 03:33.280
So that is one thing that I have particularly loved about open source.

03:33.280 --> 03:38.080
Apart from that, you build a very good network with the folks.

03:38.080 --> 03:42.840
So that is what I have truly enjoyed.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.720
We used to have a long,

03:44.720 --> 03:48.920
long just chitchatting with the contributors and the collaborators,

03:48.920 --> 03:50.480
just knowing each other.

03:50.480 --> 03:55.480
So that was also something that you don't really just do work.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.680
You also do something that connects you.

03:58.680 --> 04:02.040
So the open source is for everyone,

04:02.040 --> 04:04.800
and whatever the technologies,

04:04.800 --> 04:06.560
whatever things are being built,

04:06.560 --> 04:08.680
they are all indebted to open source.

04:08.680 --> 04:14.080
So even small contribution is making such big impact,

04:14.080 --> 04:21.480
and that is also something that excites you to write more and more better code,

04:21.480 --> 04:26.080
or it could be more contributions whenever you are available.

04:26.080 --> 04:31.640
So yeah, that's my personal alignment to open source.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.400
Now that you've been active,

04:33.400 --> 04:36.600
you've been active down the software industry for a while.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.840
But maybe you can tell us a little bit about your background

04:40.840 --> 04:46.400
and what made you decide to get involved in this industry in the first place.

04:46.400 --> 04:51.000
Yeah. So if I talk about my high school,

04:51.000 --> 04:52.800
so I was a science student,

04:52.800 --> 04:54.880
so there were a lot of options for me.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.360
I chose software engineering because that was

04:58.360 --> 05:03.400
the best option that I could get because what I have seen,

05:03.400 --> 05:04.920
it has a lot of opportunities.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.920
You can literally go into a lot of areas,

05:07.920 --> 05:11.760
and that too involves a lot of research as well.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.920
If you're into research,

05:12.920 --> 05:14.480
if you're into doing something new,

05:14.480 --> 05:20.120
then AI and everything are there which are under aggressive research.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.560
Today, like blockchain and the other metaverse technologies

05:23.560 --> 05:26.000
are there for a lot of research.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.560
So that was my reason for choosing software engineering,

05:29.560 --> 05:31.240
but I was literally clueless.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.600
I was just going to college and coming back,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.560
doing those assignments and all.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.000
But I always had that fear that,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.240
will I be able to go at a really good company?

05:42.240 --> 05:49.400
So that phase of mine where I was just in the bubble of my college and that small network,

05:49.400 --> 05:51.560
I had that competitive mindset that,

05:51.560 --> 05:55.280
okay, this person is doing better than me,

05:55.280 --> 05:57.920
so will I be able to do even better?

05:57.920 --> 06:02.760
So that competitive mindset actually was inside me that,

06:02.760 --> 06:03.920
am I doing better?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.320
Even I used to see more GitHub contributions,

06:06.320 --> 06:09.440
I used to get that envy feeling that,

06:09.440 --> 06:11.920
will I be able to get that?

06:11.920 --> 06:16.400
I was always having that fear under my head that,

06:16.400 --> 06:17.720
what after college?

06:17.720 --> 06:19.400
What after my graduation?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.080
Everything was that.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.960
Then I decided, okay,

06:22.960 --> 06:29.360
let's not get into this mindset and let's come out and see what

06:29.360 --> 06:32.880
the other people are doing on the Internet.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.480
Then slowly and gradually,

06:34.480 --> 06:39.600
I started joining this Discord servers of different communities.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.720
I joined this React Flux,

06:41.720 --> 06:44.440
which is very popular where you see job posting,

06:44.440 --> 06:46.440
where you see different questions.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.240
So that was something I saw people are just helping out.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.520
You are just asking a question and a lot of people who are

06:54.520 --> 06:59.520
very popular people in the maintainer and open source world,

06:59.520 --> 07:01.920
they are helping to solve even small, small bugs.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.680
So that made me realize that,

07:03.680 --> 07:07.400
okay, it is not that you are into competition,

07:07.400 --> 07:11.200
but there I learned the importance like open source fundamental,

07:11.200 --> 07:15.240
that it is about collaboration first and code second mindset.

07:15.240 --> 07:19.720
So that actually made me understand,

07:19.720 --> 07:22.040
okay, there is a lot more to it.

07:22.040 --> 07:26.480
Then I first stepped into machine learning side of things.

07:26.480 --> 07:33.200
So I did a lot of learning on that side and I really enjoyed it.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.360
But after a certain point,

07:35.360 --> 07:38.720
I was getting into proper research.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.720
But then due to some reason,

07:42.720 --> 07:44.880
my friend just told me like,

07:44.880 --> 07:47.840
you can try web development.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.200
I'm doing this. So it was sort of a freelance work.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.600
So I did that and I really enjoyed it.

07:54.600 --> 07:59.520
I didn't know that CSS could be this interesting.

07:59.520 --> 08:04.480
Generally, it is a mindset that when you start learning,

08:04.480 --> 08:07.880
then you have to do it.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.480
So CSS was challenging,

08:09.480 --> 08:11.360
but also interesting at the same time.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.280
So I was getting that alignment.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.920
Then I saw web development has,

08:18.920 --> 08:20.720
if we see on a larger scale,

08:20.720 --> 08:23.680
it has a lot of job opportunities.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.720
Plus, I found out that my software engineering fundamentals

08:27.720 --> 08:32.480
are clearly seen practical in that part more,

08:32.480 --> 08:35.480
compared to what I was doing in other side.

08:35.480 --> 08:39.520
For example, if I say client server architecture,

08:39.520 --> 08:42.640
that is one main paradigm of software engineering.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.680
So I could see that in practice in web development.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.760
So that just gave me that kick.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.280
Plus, one thing that you can build stuff.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.840
So you can even build small application

08:53.840 --> 08:56.160
for your day-to-day real usage.

08:56.160 --> 09:01.280
So that actually gave me that confidence.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.360
At that point, I realized that I can switch

09:05.360 --> 09:08.480
my focus and attention to just one thing,

09:08.480 --> 09:11.920
at least for now, I can go with web development.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.880
It is not confined to just this field,

09:14.880 --> 09:16.360
but I will do this.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.800
So in AI, I did some research and review papers as well.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.920
But I decided that this is not going to be,

09:24.920 --> 09:27.880
at least for now, this is not going to be my career path.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.560
And I started learning JavaScript.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.280
I started learning React and all.

09:32.280 --> 09:39.400
So this was my way I divide the trajectory.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.760
Basically, I got into web development.

09:41.760 --> 09:46.120
And then I started just being involved in the community.

09:46.120 --> 09:50.080
So by that, I learned a lot of things.

09:50.080 --> 09:51.280
That's very interesting.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.280
Yeah.

09:52.280 --> 09:56.640
And so throughout this whole process

09:56.640 --> 10:00.120
of learning and experimenting and kind of switching even,

10:00.120 --> 10:04.480
switching careers, if you want to call it,

10:04.480 --> 10:09.520
what have you found the most challenging about the industry

10:09.520 --> 10:12.640
and about learning?

10:12.640 --> 10:14.160
OK.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.680
I guess the most challenging part is the start point,

10:18.680 --> 10:20.400
the head start.

10:20.400 --> 10:24.360
So when I was just into web development,

10:24.360 --> 10:28.760
so first thing that I faced was the tutorial hell.

10:28.760 --> 10:33.400
Anyone who is into just starting out any technology,

10:33.400 --> 10:37.560
if one just sees the YouTube videos

10:37.560 --> 10:41.040
and just do the line by line implementation,

10:41.040 --> 10:43.360
then the learning is actually cut off.

10:43.360 --> 10:50.040
And that is just literally you are getting that fake dopamine

10:50.040 --> 10:52.040
hit that you have made something.

10:52.040 --> 10:55.600
But that is actually that is just

10:55.600 --> 10:57.440
you are doing from YouTube video.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.160
So that I did for a long time.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.360
I used to watch like, OK, I want to learn, for example, React

11:04.360 --> 11:05.160
table, right?

11:05.160 --> 11:07.440
I want to learn table stuff on React.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.400
So I used to watch that whole video.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.520
In reality, it should be I should read the documentation

11:12.520 --> 11:14.040
or I should read blogs.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.160
So this was a big, big issue.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.600
I used to spend hours and hours of watching videos,

11:19.600 --> 11:22.080
even the different courses on Udemy and all.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.120
I took them.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.040
And I was just watching and watching

11:25.040 --> 11:29.080
and very less implementation was there and very less mind

11:29.080 --> 11:30.880
I was putting into it.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.880
So that actually was a big challenge.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.800
Even in machine learning, I realized

11:36.800 --> 11:40.440
that what I was doing previously was just

11:40.440 --> 11:43.600
like looking at different YouTube videos

11:43.600 --> 11:46.400
or Udemy or different courses.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.560
And then I was just coding it out on my ID

11:49.560 --> 11:52.160
and just making the output come.

11:52.160 --> 11:57.080
But I feel that this is actually not the right way to learn.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.600
So then I realized that I should focus.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.560
I should pressure myself a little bit

12:03.560 --> 12:10.280
that I go to these documentation sites or the blog sites

12:10.280 --> 12:12.800
or even if I'm watching a tutorial video,

12:12.800 --> 12:16.520
I should be mindful that I am using my own brain

12:16.520 --> 12:19.760
to make something, giving things time.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.600
So then this was a big challenge for me at least.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.840
Like I spent more than four months

12:24.840 --> 12:27.960
and even I got internship with that particular knowledge

12:27.960 --> 12:29.200
that I was doing.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.080
But even after the internship, I realized that I still

12:32.080 --> 12:33.680
lack the fundamentals.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.520
So this was something very insightful.

12:36.520 --> 12:40.160
And then I came across a boot camp called Neoji Camp.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.560
So this web development boot camp actually

12:42.560 --> 12:45.440
helped me a lot in my career.

12:45.440 --> 12:49.280
What I have learned from there, the community and everything,

12:49.280 --> 12:56.280
I am totally indebted to what I have learned in that boot camp.

12:56.280 --> 13:01.920
So there can be any different sort of these resources.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.520
But the idea is that even there you

13:04.520 --> 13:07.920
do this tutorial copy pasting or this type of thing,

13:07.920 --> 13:11.600
then again, that would be an issue.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.080
So yeah, one idea that I have followed that first thing

13:16.080 --> 13:18.600
that I have to do is think by my mind,

13:18.600 --> 13:21.960
then go to documentation, understand it thoroughly.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.360
And then if I'm getting nothing, then I

13:24.360 --> 13:29.720
go to maybe just the YouTube video and just quickly see.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.920
But it is not that follow that thing.

13:33.920 --> 13:38.360
So yeah, that was a little bit thing

13:38.360 --> 13:42.400
I could share about my experience.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
Yeah, that's interesting.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.360
Yeah, I think for myself also, what I have found

13:47.360 --> 13:53.920
is I find it hard to learn something

13:53.920 --> 13:58.320
if I don't have anywhere to use it in the moment,

13:58.320 --> 13:59.800
if you know what I mean.

13:59.800 --> 14:04.040
So I find if I can think of a need,

14:04.040 --> 14:08.280
like the way they say scratching your own itch, that thing.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.600
So I think of an idea, and I'm like, OK, cool.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.520
So I have this idea.

14:12.520 --> 14:16.560
So what technologies are out there that I'd like to learn?

14:16.560 --> 14:19.240
And then I would pick one of these technologies

14:19.240 --> 14:21.120
that I'm not as familiar with.

14:21.120 --> 14:25.440
And I would learn it and use it to build this thing

14:25.440 --> 14:27.920
that I didn't want to build for myself.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.680
I kind of feel like that is a better way for me

14:30.680 --> 14:35.480
personally of learning, other than just building yet another

14:35.480 --> 14:39.080
to-do application or something like that.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.040
That is very spot on.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.320
The one which you mentioned, the way

14:43.320 --> 14:45.600
to go is understanding the problem

14:45.600 --> 14:48.680
and then searching for the available solutions,

14:48.680 --> 14:52.200
implemented solution in the market.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.000
For example, if I had to implement a graph library,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.320
I won't be going to a tutorial where the guy uses a graph

14:59.320 --> 15:01.040
library.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.560
But it would be like what my design says,

15:04.560 --> 15:07.120
what my future product requirement says,

15:07.120 --> 15:09.760
or what I have at least imagined for my project

15:09.760 --> 15:12.600
that I would be implementing this stuff in my graph.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.760
And then I see different options,

15:14.760 --> 15:17.320
like how do you go for shopping?

15:17.320 --> 15:18.520
It is exactly like that.

15:18.520 --> 15:22.560
You see different things that are similar for your use case,

15:22.560 --> 15:25.120
but you choose whatever fits your need,

15:25.120 --> 15:28.720
not what the shopkeeper gives us.

15:28.720 --> 15:33.400
So that is the idea that I feel everywhere I have seen.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.920
In fact, when my professional thing started,

15:36.920 --> 15:39.320
we had to write these design documents

15:39.320 --> 15:42.360
for different implementations.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.240
So we used to research on various options

15:45.240 --> 15:51.400
and the library which we want to introduce.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.080
So because that takes up the bundle size,

15:54.080 --> 16:00.280
so the practice should be very mindful about the feature

16:00.280 --> 16:02.120
and not the technology.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.200
I agree 100%.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.240
Yeah.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.400
So you've mentioned a couple of resources,

16:10.400 --> 16:13.800
but if you had to pull together a couple of things

16:13.800 --> 16:17.080
that you found particularly useful up to now,

16:17.080 --> 16:20.640
what are those resources?

16:20.640 --> 16:22.840
Right.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.720
For resource, I would say that first thing

16:25.720 --> 16:28.240
that the best resource, I would say,

16:28.240 --> 16:31.960
is the MDN documentation, at least for web development.

16:31.960 --> 16:36.760
That is the way that should come into practice.

16:36.760 --> 16:40.120
Even if it is difficult for one as a beginner,

16:40.120 --> 16:44.800
still it is something that you need to get used to it,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.880
at least the starting part.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.200
Because all other resources are sort

16:49.200 --> 16:52.320
of an extract from this resource only.

16:52.320 --> 16:58.360
So not just this, but the very source of truth,

16:58.360 --> 17:01.440
in the community, I guess it is the MDN docs.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.720
So other resources are an extract of this.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.080
So one thing that if you need anything,

17:07.080 --> 17:09.920
then this is going to be your source of truth.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.000
You can quote it.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.400
It is given at MDN.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.320
So there is a high possibility that we

17:15.320 --> 17:20.600
need to just reconsider our belief about XYZ thing

17:20.600 --> 17:26.240
that we are knowing about JavaScript or web in general.

17:26.240 --> 17:29.000
But apart from this, the fundamentals

17:29.000 --> 17:32.920
should be very, very clear about any language.

17:32.920 --> 17:37.280
This I have realized when I got some challenging work.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.880
So on building simple Figma screens,

17:40.880 --> 17:43.560
implementation into code is very simple.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.920
We can just make some CSS changes

17:45.920 --> 17:48.640
and just make the thing work.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.920
But when there is complexity, when

17:50.920 --> 17:55.600
there is making things as scale, or any more complexity

17:55.600 --> 17:58.200
will be introduced, then you will realize, OK,

17:58.200 --> 17:59.760
this concept should be known.

17:59.760 --> 18:05.760
Else, on a longer run, the code will be spaghetti.

18:05.760 --> 18:09.560
So that concept, JavaScript React concepts

18:09.560 --> 18:11.000
are very important.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.640
So I would say JavaScript.info is the website

18:14.640 --> 18:17.040
that I have admired a lot.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.520
They have put everything so much structured and nicely

18:21.520 --> 18:23.240
with very good example.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.960
So for a beginner, this is the resource.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.000
Even it has helped a lot in interviews

18:31.000 --> 18:34.040
where you have to crisp.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.480
You want crisp info.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.600
So JavaScript info is very good for beginners.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.840
Apart from that, there is a YouTube playlist

18:42.840 --> 18:45.640
called Namaste JS, which is by Akshay Saini.

18:45.640 --> 18:50.080
So he also explains the JavaScript concepts and all

18:50.080 --> 18:52.640
in very, very good depth.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.920
And also, one thing that I realized,

18:54.920 --> 18:57.720
that even if you are doing that tutorial healthing in this

18:57.720 --> 18:59.840
as well, it applies the same.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.480
So this resource is also good.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.400
But if you're not implementing, then it

19:04.400 --> 19:05.880
is, again, the same story.

19:05.880 --> 19:10.360
But the reason why I love this playlist or the videos

19:10.360 --> 19:15.040
of Namaste JavaScript is the way that is being explained

19:15.040 --> 19:18.800
is from the core, so that I particularly like.

19:18.800 --> 19:23.720
It is not just syntax, but it is how it works on the behind.

19:23.720 --> 19:24.600
So yeah.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.880
But apart from that, if you really

19:26.880 --> 19:32.040
want to work on particular things like Next.js or Webpack

19:32.040 --> 19:34.040
or something like that, then there

19:34.040 --> 19:39.120
is Frontend Master's course, which are pretty good.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.960
I got it from GitHub pack.

19:40.960 --> 19:44.000
So if you are a student, then definitely you

19:44.000 --> 19:46.920
should exercise your GitHub student pack

19:46.920 --> 19:50.600
and get Frontend Master's, or else you can buy as well.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.520
But Frontend Master's course are really, really quality courses.

19:54.520 --> 20:00.040
So definitely, I would consider buying or even

20:00.040 --> 20:02.560
for resource or for the learning.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.800
So yeah, you just need to search the right things,

20:05.800 --> 20:08.840
and Google will make the SEO work for you.

20:08.840 --> 20:14.800
So just like searching, keep building, SEO will work.

20:14.800 --> 20:16.400
Yeah.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.360
Yeah, I have to agree.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.080
Frontend Master's is really good.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.960
I use that as well.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.200
So you've mentioned a whole bunch of resources,

20:25.200 --> 20:26.360
and they sound great.

20:26.360 --> 20:31.560
But I'm wondering, what do you find missing or stuff

20:31.560 --> 20:33.760
that can be improved?

20:33.760 --> 20:37.640
OK, in these resources, one thing

20:37.640 --> 20:43.320
that if we see blog-based resource, for example,

20:43.320 --> 20:46.520
JavaScript Info, so if you just read those blogs

20:46.520 --> 20:50.760
and just make the examples that they give,

20:50.760 --> 20:56.040
you just implement them, then I guess it won't be enough.

20:56.040 --> 20:59.880
So when you read a book, if you just read the whole book

20:59.880 --> 21:05.840
without thinking or implementing about it,

21:05.840 --> 21:08.120
then it won't make any sense.

21:08.120 --> 21:11.640
So it is the same with JavaScript Info.

21:11.640 --> 21:15.160
For example, if you have learned about closures.

21:15.160 --> 21:19.400
But the ideal or a good way, I would say,

21:19.400 --> 21:22.280
it won't be just stopping at that point.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.840
You can just give yourself some time to digest.

21:25.840 --> 21:30.360
Then you can look for other blogs available maybe

21:30.360 --> 21:34.720
on Medium or Hashnode, these blogging websites,

21:34.720 --> 21:39.680
and know how other concepts that you might have missed.

21:39.680 --> 21:44.000
For example, the disadvantages of closures.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.440
This is a topic that might have not

21:47.440 --> 21:49.000
been covered at JavaScript Info.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
So you can just see.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.320
So when you give yourself time to digest things,

21:53.320 --> 21:55.360
then only it will actually fruit.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.840
Else, you will forget.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.800
If you read the whole JavaScript Info in one day,

21:59.800 --> 22:02.360
then it won't result into anything.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.000
So that is one thing that is being missing.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.040
The other thing, I feel that they are lacking code.

22:12.040 --> 22:16.280
They are not having enough code examples

22:16.280 --> 22:23.880
that you need to become a master or at least a good level

22:23.880 --> 22:26.040
at the particular technology.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.640
Not pointing at any one, all the other resource

22:29.640 --> 22:32.680
because they have limitation of number of examples

22:32.680 --> 22:35.920
because they don't want that content to be very long.

22:35.920 --> 22:38.960
So as a developer, what I used to do,

22:38.960 --> 22:43.520
I used to Google JavaScript questions on closures.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.280
There will be 10 different websites.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.720
I just used to pick and put it on my GitHub repo

22:48.720 --> 22:51.640
so I can refer them later.

22:51.640 --> 22:56.440
So this is the way we can just compensate that

22:56.440 --> 23:00.440
because code is everything, right?

23:00.440 --> 23:04.480
Enough number of lines of text is not that much,

23:04.480 --> 23:07.040
how much 10-liner code can explain.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.920
So that's why code is something that you

23:09.920 --> 23:13.400
need to have in abundance when you are learning.

23:13.400 --> 23:19.880
And one thing that JavaScript Info example I gave, right?

23:19.880 --> 23:22.080
So one thing I used to do with my friend,

23:22.080 --> 23:24.000
we used to do pair learning.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.480
So what we used to do, we used to pick

23:26.480 --> 23:34.080
some topics of our interview questions, right?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.440
JavaScript fundamental questions.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.440
For example, it could be closures or promises.

23:37.440 --> 23:41.360
We used to just divide amongst each other.

23:41.360 --> 23:44.200
And then we used to explain those to each other.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.400
And then we used to have discussions.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.720
And we used to have debates.

23:47.720 --> 23:53.640
And then we ran across Google and searched

23:53.640 --> 23:55.440
what was the real right answer.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.960
So those conversations, I feel they

23:57.960 --> 24:02.480
were a lot more productive than anything else.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.000
So the human connect is something different

24:05.000 --> 24:06.960
that I have realized that when you

24:06.960 --> 24:11.760
have friends who are into the same path you are going towards,

24:11.760 --> 24:14.440
then it is very helpful.

24:14.440 --> 24:19.120
And that is also a big, big benefit of being in a community.

24:19.120 --> 24:23.560
You just text on Discord that, OK, I've learned this.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.600
I want to explain that to anyone who wants to join.

24:26.600 --> 24:32.360
Go on the channel and just start discussing, right?

24:32.360 --> 24:38.160
So this is one thing that has helped me a lot in my interview

24:38.160 --> 24:39.080
learning process.

24:39.080 --> 24:43.000
And yeah, that is one fond memory.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.800
And I also made very good friendship

24:44.800 --> 24:49.600
with the bond as well.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.240
That is really, really interesting.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.080
I've never heard people say that before.

24:54.080 --> 24:58.480
The specific having a debate and that whole thing,

24:58.480 --> 24:59.680
that's super interesting.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.640
And I can imagine that'll work really well.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.800
I was just telling that we had a big, I guess,

25:06.800 --> 25:10.280
one and a half hour debate on JavaScript is interpreted

25:10.280 --> 25:11.880
language or a compiled language.

25:11.880 --> 25:17.600
Because there is not exactly one stamp answer to that.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.720
There are a lot of complexity on what perspective you are talking.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.760
So that was a really amazing discussion.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.840
So yeah, please go ahead.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.600
No, no, thanks for sharing that.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.360
That's really interesting.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.160
So I was thinking, you've been through the interview process.

25:34.160 --> 25:40.440
So what do you think about interviews in the tech industry?

25:40.440 --> 25:45.680
It's a little scary, and maybe you think should be changed?

25:45.680 --> 25:48.200
Or how do you think it can be improved?

25:50.760 --> 25:55.240
Yeah, so one thing that I recently gave a lot of interviews.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.280
So one thing that in common which I realized

25:58.280 --> 26:02.480
that was a little bit of blocker was I was not even

26:02.480 --> 26:10.280
having enough context of what I will be giving interview

26:10.280 --> 26:11.080
for that, right?

26:11.080 --> 26:13.280
So just an example.

26:13.280 --> 26:18.480
So some companies like ask something very, very advanced

26:18.480 --> 26:20.280
in the first round itself.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.920
And some of them just ask basics.

26:22.920 --> 26:27.280
Or even if we are doing for a front end role,

26:27.280 --> 26:31.960
I was asked something very unexpected about system design.

26:31.960 --> 26:36.320
So that is one thing that there should be a little bit clarity

26:36.320 --> 26:39.800
upon what skills you will be assessed in a particular round.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.400
So you are prepared.

26:42.400 --> 26:46.480
For example, if I was asked about web performance, right?

26:46.480 --> 26:51.320
But at that point, I was not remembering

26:51.320 --> 26:54.040
what I learned about web performance,

26:54.040 --> 26:57.200
at least at the time of the interview.

26:57.200 --> 27:01.120
So I had to ask that, could you let me Google?

27:01.120 --> 27:03.640
So they did let me, but what if they didn't?

27:03.640 --> 27:08.440
So I was not remembering the names like FID or the terms.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.320
So that could lead that I am not knowing.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.880
But in reality, I was knowing.

27:12.880 --> 27:16.120
I had learned about or experimented

27:16.120 --> 27:17.720
about these things before.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.000
So yeah, these type of things.

27:20.000 --> 27:25.520
I was once asked like dynamic programming question.

27:25.520 --> 27:30.640
So generally, I at least don't expect a lot of this

27:30.640 --> 27:34.840
complex algorithm as a fresher into front end

27:34.840 --> 27:40.960
that we are asked a lot more this typical data structure

27:40.960 --> 27:41.800
algorithm question.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.280
But even if they're coming, then I

27:43.280 --> 27:46.800
should know that, OK, I should be prepared.

27:46.800 --> 27:47.880
So this is one thing.

27:50.920 --> 27:56.080
Else I have a feeling that for interviews,

27:56.080 --> 28:01.120
if you are prepared enough, then things are very, very simple.

28:01.120 --> 28:06.280
But it is not the case for every time and everyone.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.640
Some people might be a little bit nervous

28:09.640 --> 28:14.200
or that is into nature because that depends.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.720
So for that, I feel that practice

28:16.720 --> 28:19.360
is something that gives you confidence.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.040
But we as a human, we need validation.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.240
So even if I have solved 100 questions

28:25.240 --> 28:29.080
and I practice a lot, but that is not validated by someone.

28:29.080 --> 28:33.520
So I need someone to validate that, OK, I'm

28:33.520 --> 28:36.320
at least ready to appear for interview.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.200
So peers helped a lot.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.800
I used to give mock interviews with my friends on Twitter.

28:42.800 --> 28:48.800
So two, three people on Twitter helped me for mock interviews.

28:48.800 --> 28:53.640
So even that person is not as equal experience as us,

28:53.640 --> 28:58.200
but at least we can be confident that am I able to explain.

28:58.200 --> 29:03.120
So that part I can add.

29:03.120 --> 29:11.320
Apart from that, I always have that one sort of fear

29:11.320 --> 29:16.600
that whatever I am knowing that in one interview,

29:16.600 --> 29:18.760
I was asked, do you know CSS?

29:18.760 --> 29:20.960
Then I literally had no answer.

29:20.960 --> 29:25.120
If I say yes and that I'm asked very, very difficult

29:25.120 --> 29:28.160
or in-depth question of CSS, then what will happen?

29:28.160 --> 29:32.520
So that thing, I always am not sure

29:32.520 --> 29:35.760
that how much in-depth knowledge you want or you

29:35.760 --> 29:40.360
need for a particular role, because that is very variable.

29:40.360 --> 29:43.800
So that was very, very.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.640
And I've seen in interviews, you are asked yourself

29:46.640 --> 29:53.120
to rate on some numbers, which I particularly find weird,

29:53.120 --> 29:55.920
because I am generally asked, out of 10,

29:55.920 --> 29:57.400
how much you rate yourself.

29:57.400 --> 30:01.920
So I don't know how, because even if you are reactive,

30:01.920 --> 30:04.120
you are not Dan Abramo, right?

30:04.120 --> 30:06.160
So you don't know everything.

30:06.160 --> 30:09.960
So you cannot tell you are above eight or nine.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.400
So yeah, that sometimes.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.240
But it's fine.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.600
I don't think that is any issue.

30:14.600 --> 30:19.920
That's just a way to see if you are confident enough.

30:19.920 --> 30:20.920
Yeah, I guess.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.360
Yeah, yeah.

30:23.360 --> 30:28.920
So just a pop quiz question.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.240
Would you rather start your own business

30:31.240 --> 30:34.560
or rather join a company?

30:34.560 --> 30:40.560
Yeah, this is actually a question

30:40.560 --> 30:44.480
that I actually don't have any right answer, at least

30:44.480 --> 30:47.520
for now, a little bit tricky for me.

30:47.520 --> 30:53.760
But I really want to start my own business.

30:53.760 --> 30:59.720
But the key is if I get the right idea or a product,

30:59.720 --> 31:02.280
that particularly I believe in.

31:02.280 --> 31:06.480
So if I want to do something and I

31:06.480 --> 31:09.720
reach to that particular stage where I can actually

31:09.720 --> 31:13.600
implement that, given that all the factors you need,

31:13.600 --> 31:17.840
so then definitely I would go for my startup or something.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.520
But apart from that, even anywhere I'm at,

31:22.520 --> 31:27.120
if my work, whatever I'm doing is valued,

31:27.120 --> 31:30.480
and if I'm satisfied at the end of the day,

31:30.480 --> 31:33.520
then I guess that is really cool.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.680
You are doing good at work.

31:34.680 --> 31:38.160
And life is also, apart from work,

31:38.160 --> 31:40.680
you want to do what you're passionate about, maybe

31:40.680 --> 31:43.360
some hobby or something that you do for fun.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.920
So that balance is also some people look for.

31:46.920 --> 31:49.640
That is totally depending on person to person.

31:49.640 --> 31:54.640
But I would like to also keep my hobbies as priority.

31:54.640 --> 31:58.280
So I don't want to be super, super workaholic.

31:58.280 --> 32:02.520
I also want to have the balance between both.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.320
That's good.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.520
And that leads nicely into the next question, which is,

32:06.520 --> 32:12.560
what do you like to do when you don't code or learn to code?

32:12.560 --> 32:17.840
So I would say I do different stuff.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.840
I just try experimenting different things.

32:21.840 --> 32:27.120
For example, sometimes I see my friends learning something.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.320
I just ask, from where you are learning?

32:29.320 --> 32:33.160
So recently, my friend was learning music and guitar

32:33.160 --> 32:33.720
and stuff.

32:33.720 --> 32:36.040
So I have an interest in singing.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.200
I'm not a good singer.

32:37.200 --> 32:42.520
But he explained me in more technical terms of music.

32:42.520 --> 32:45.360
So I have been into that.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.680
I love doing that.

32:47.680 --> 32:51.520
Also, from this new year, Jan, I decided

32:51.520 --> 32:53.840
I would focus more on my health as well.

32:53.840 --> 32:57.040
So I've been doing yoga and meditation

32:57.040 --> 33:00.640
and have continued that habit till now.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.000
So that is also a win for me.

33:03.000 --> 33:07.760
But I really enjoy doing yoga and all these things.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.840
A lot good for mental health and peace.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.320
So also for stretch and everything,

33:13.320 --> 33:16.360
I really feel energetic throughout the day.

33:16.360 --> 33:21.840
Apart from that, I'm having a very, not exactly hobby,

33:21.840 --> 33:24.720
but I love experimenting with my habits.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.720
So even small, small things, like you

33:26.720 --> 33:30.280
refrain from something for one week.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.520
Are you able to control yourself from doing that?

33:32.520 --> 33:36.080
It could be as simple as not watching TV.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.040
This is a habit, right?

33:37.040 --> 33:40.280
You are challenging yourself that, OK,

33:40.280 --> 33:42.600
I'm not going to do something.

33:42.600 --> 33:45.560
It is more towards that part.

33:45.560 --> 33:52.480
Are we not getting a lot much slaves of our own mind?

33:52.480 --> 33:59.040
So that is an exercise that I like doing whenever I like.

33:59.040 --> 34:02.960
So if you could recommend a single resource, that

34:02.960 --> 34:07.440
could be a book, a course, YouTube channel, a community,

34:07.440 --> 34:10.520
whatever, what would you recommend?

34:13.480 --> 34:18.120
So for a book, I'm not much into reading self-help books,

34:18.120 --> 34:19.040
first of all.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.960
But I have read Atomic Habits.

34:20.960 --> 34:26.000
So that was a really, really good book, if you implement.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.280
So whatever is said in that book,

34:28.280 --> 34:32.920
it has actually helped me a lot to think back

34:32.920 --> 34:36.880
and on what I'm currently doing, what my habits are.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.720
And that is where I have got this motivation

34:39.720 --> 34:44.960
to try out different stuff and improve our habits.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.360
So that is one book I would definitely

34:47.360 --> 34:49.200
recommend to implement.

34:49.200 --> 34:53.640
Apart from that, Neoji Camp Bootcamp

34:53.640 --> 34:58.040
is something that has changed my trajectory about the career.

34:58.040 --> 35:02.440
If I had not done that, if I had not got the community there

35:02.440 --> 35:06.160
and the friends and the mentorship, everything there,

35:06.160 --> 35:11.160
then I am not sure what I would have been doing.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.960
But yeah, it is sort of very close to my heart.

35:13.960 --> 35:16.520
And I am very indebted to that.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.920
So you can check that out.

35:17.920 --> 35:23.600
It is a very, very good cohort of learning web development.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.520
So yeah, that is what I strongly recommend.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.520
It is more about you learn together.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.760
And also, they help you in placements as well.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.880
If you intend to get a job, then they

35:34.880 --> 35:36.400
help you with that as well.

35:36.400 --> 35:40.960
So yeah, it has helped me a lot, so definitely.

35:40.960 --> 35:46.000
But else, resources-wise, I guess if we see properly,

35:46.000 --> 35:47.640
then we will find things around.

35:47.640 --> 35:51.480
Just being connected with the community,

35:51.480 --> 35:53.480
because people has a lot of stories to tell.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.400
So if you connect with someone today,

35:55.400 --> 35:58.760
that person will tell you his or her 10 resources.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.280
And then you know a lot of things,

36:01.280 --> 36:04.960
and then you can evaluate what fits best for you.

36:04.960 --> 36:08.520
But that information comes by communicating.

36:08.520 --> 36:12.640
So that is one thing that I would say as a resource,

36:12.640 --> 36:13.920
I would say.

36:13.920 --> 36:17.440
And apart from that, you asked about community.

36:17.440 --> 36:20.040
So I told about Discord groups.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.320
They are amazing.

36:21.320 --> 36:24.800
Whenever you want to hang out, you should.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.600
At least in the tech community, networking

36:27.600 --> 36:30.200
is a very, very crucial part.

36:30.200 --> 36:34.280
Because I have seen that directly applying

36:34.280 --> 36:37.520
at a company's portal versus getting a referral

36:37.520 --> 36:42.600
is a very big difference, and also not a referral.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.000
But you can at least ask the person,

36:45.000 --> 36:46.760
is the company really good?

36:46.760 --> 36:49.080
Is it fitting your requirements?

36:49.080 --> 36:54.520
So that's why networking is crucial in all different terms.

36:54.520 --> 36:58.800
And yeah, I have been attending and being involved

36:58.800 --> 37:03.920
with the meetup groups in my, like I have been involved

37:03.920 --> 37:07.120
with React, the technology that I am interested in.

37:07.120 --> 37:11.600
So there's React Bangalore, JavaScript Bangalore meetups.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.320
So these are the meetup groups that I have been involved.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.480
I've also given a couple of talks.

37:16.480 --> 37:20.280
But overall, what I focus is on learning.

37:20.280 --> 37:26.520
So yeah, tech meetup groups are definitely a place to go.

37:26.520 --> 37:29.560
Sometimes some Saturday when you are free,

37:29.560 --> 37:34.880
you should hop in to the live meetings, or talks,

37:34.880 --> 37:37.560
or workshops, whatever you like.

37:37.560 --> 37:40.200
Yeah, I 100% agree.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.120
Community is super important.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.360
So if you could nominate someone that you

37:48.360 --> 37:51.080
think I should speak to on this podcast,

37:51.080 --> 37:52.840
who would you nominate?

37:52.840 --> 37:53.340
Right.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.440
Yeah, first thing that I feel that you should definitely

37:59.440 --> 38:01.480
talk with is Sage.

38:01.480 --> 38:05.200
He is the creator of Chakra UI framework,

38:05.200 --> 38:09.360
which is a very popular front-end framework.

38:09.360 --> 38:13.800
So the reason, because I had been in the meetings

38:13.800 --> 38:17.240
previously when I was involved with Chakra UI actively,

38:17.240 --> 38:21.440
he is a very humble person and very knowledgeable, very expert

38:21.440 --> 38:23.360
in this domain.

38:23.360 --> 38:27.440
And I'm really inspired from what work he has put

38:27.440 --> 38:31.440
and what things he does for the community.

38:31.440 --> 38:37.280
So that is my nomination, if you would say that.

38:37.280 --> 38:41.040
But Sage is the person that I would say.

38:41.040 --> 38:45.040
Apart from that, Johnny Berger, I'm not sure you know him.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.080
I've seen him or not.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.520
But he is a creator of Remotion.

38:48.520 --> 38:53.120
And I have also made a couple of small contributions

38:53.120 --> 38:54.960
and have been on the Discord.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.000
So he's also a very passionate person

38:57.000 --> 39:01.080
about open source and overall.

39:01.080 --> 39:03.720
So yeah, definitely them.

39:03.720 --> 39:11.760
And if you want to talk more about student-centric or

39:11.760 --> 39:15.000
learner-centric side, so then I would

39:15.000 --> 39:19.600
recommend that you can talk with Tanay Pratap.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.600
He's the founder of Invact.

39:21.600 --> 39:24.000
And he was also involved with NeojiCamp.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.560
He used to help mentor us and teach us.

39:26.560 --> 39:31.520
So yeah, definitely he's an amazing person

39:31.520 --> 39:33.440
for the students.

39:33.440 --> 39:38.600
And yeah, this is really, this can

39:38.600 --> 39:43.840
be very helpful for anyone learning, getting started.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.880
Yeah, those sound all like great people.

39:45.880 --> 39:48.360
I'll definitely reach out to them.

39:48.360 --> 39:53.960
So before we wrap this up, please tell us about any projects

39:53.960 --> 39:56.960
you would like our audience to know about,

39:56.960 --> 39:59.600
any work opportunities you're open to,

39:59.600 --> 40:06.480
what kind you're interested in, and how people can contact you.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.680
Yeah, sure.

40:07.680 --> 40:13.120
So first thing, to be honest, I have

40:13.120 --> 40:15.640
done a couple of projects and all.

40:15.640 --> 40:19.960
But one project that has been very close to me

40:19.960 --> 40:26.320
was the one that I did in December.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.800
It was done in November.

40:27.800 --> 40:32.440
So basically, it is a mock backend

40:32.440 --> 40:35.920
for the front-end developers who are just

40:35.920 --> 40:37.480
learning and making projects.

40:37.480 --> 40:39.960
So it is just for learning purpose.

40:39.960 --> 40:43.160
But the thing is, if you are making an e-commerce

40:43.160 --> 40:47.360
application, so the problem is, if you just make the front-end,

40:47.360 --> 40:51.280
if we are making just front-end and putting just dummy data,

40:51.280 --> 40:55.840
then it is not making any use of the API call

40:55.840 --> 40:58.720
or the client server thing.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.840
Or if I want to do something complex,

41:00.840 --> 41:04.720
if I want to call different APIs in sequence,

41:04.720 --> 41:08.160
if I want to do something complex with the API calling,

41:08.160 --> 41:10.680
I want to show loading states, stuff like that.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.600
So how I will be able to do that?

41:12.600 --> 41:16.240
And if I'm not doing, then real work of a front-end person

41:16.240 --> 41:20.240
is not just making screens, but it is also

41:20.240 --> 41:23.960
about state management or data, how data will be loaded,

41:23.960 --> 41:25.880
and everything like that.

41:25.880 --> 41:29.160
So for that, I built mock me.

41:29.160 --> 41:32.640
So it gives different templates for different projects.

41:32.640 --> 41:38.440
So there are more than eight, nine templates are there.

41:38.440 --> 41:42.360
So for e-commerce or video library or social media

41:42.360 --> 41:44.760
and all, so people are really using them

41:44.760 --> 41:47.080
and finding it very helpful.

41:47.080 --> 41:52.360
So we also built what problem we realized with the library

41:52.360 --> 41:54.960
that we are using under mock me.

41:54.960 --> 41:59.040
So it is a Mirage.js-based project.

41:59.040 --> 42:04.600
So Mirage.js is a library for mocking the APIs.

42:04.600 --> 42:09.760
But the problem with Mirage.js is you cannot do stuff

42:09.760 --> 42:12.440
that you do with the real APIs.

42:12.440 --> 42:15.320
You can go to Postman or some tool

42:15.320 --> 42:19.720
and make the fetch call and see what is the response.

42:19.720 --> 42:25.320
That you cannot do with that interface is not available to you

42:25.320 --> 42:29.080
when you're doing with Mirage.js or the mock me sort of.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.680
Not going into much technicalities,

42:30.680 --> 42:33.720
but for this problem statement, we actually

42:33.720 --> 42:37.160
built another sister project called mock man.

42:37.160 --> 42:40.400
So basically, this is exactly same as Postman,

42:40.400 --> 42:44.680
but Postman are some, I guess, the different tools

42:44.680 --> 42:46.600
are available for API testing.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.520
So exactly same, but for mock APIs.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.280
So we built this for Mirage.js.

42:52.280 --> 42:56.880
So that particular project is powering more than 2,000

42:56.880 --> 42:58.320
active GitHub projects.

42:58.320 --> 43:01.040
And overall, these mock me and different templates

43:01.040 --> 43:05.440
are having, today, more than 18,000 downloads.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.600
So yeah, that is most impactful project.

43:07.600 --> 43:10.440
And people like DM me, put it on Twitter

43:10.440 --> 43:12.960
that they are getting jobs because they

43:12.960 --> 43:15.040
had it in their mock back end.

43:15.040 --> 43:18.160
Because the interviewer can see the projects they

43:18.160 --> 43:20.080
are having real functionality.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.600
So yeah, my project has been on back end,

43:22.600 --> 43:25.760
and it is helping people on the back end backstage side.

43:25.760 --> 43:29.920
So I'm very happy and proud about this project.

43:29.920 --> 43:32.760
But I really want to maintain it as well in the future.

43:32.760 --> 43:33.840
That's very cool.

43:33.840 --> 43:36.880
Yeah, thanks.

43:36.880 --> 43:37.920
Very, very nice.

43:37.920 --> 43:41.880
Well, thank you so much for joining me today, Saham.

43:41.880 --> 43:44.560
I really enjoyed the conversation.

43:44.560 --> 43:47.560
And I wish you all of the best for the future,

43:47.560 --> 43:51.320
and looking forward to see all the great things you build.

43:51.320 --> 43:55.000
Yeah, thank you so much once again for having me.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.280
