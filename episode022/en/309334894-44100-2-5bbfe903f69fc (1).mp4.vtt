00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:09.760
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.760 --> 00:14.960
Hey Ryan, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.460
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.160
It's a pleasure to join you, Skulk.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.680
Yeah, pleasure's all mine.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.040
We haven't talked in way too long.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.840
I know, way too long.

00:23.840 --> 00:24.840
Yeah.

00:24.840 --> 00:31.720
I know you from Mozilla, and for a long time we worked together on the MDN WebDocs project.

00:31.720 --> 00:38.520
And then you had a short period of time where you explored some other avenues, which we'll

00:38.520 --> 00:40.560
talk about a bit later.

00:40.560 --> 00:47.120
And then you came back to the Fall and joined the Mozilla family again.

00:47.120 --> 00:53.160
So but I think since you rejoined, both of us have been heads down on a bunch of things

00:53.160 --> 00:55.760
and never really got a chance to connect again.

00:55.760 --> 01:02.640
So I thought, what better way to reconnect than record a bloody podcast?

01:02.640 --> 01:08.480
So I invited you and I was so happy when you said you are into it.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.400
So I'm looking forward to this.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
Me too.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.880
It's an honor, Skulk.

01:13.880 --> 01:19.560
So to get us started, I've sat in many meetings where we've introduced ourselves, where we

01:19.560 --> 01:22.840
were both in the room, where we've introduced ourselves to other people, where we've shared

01:22.840 --> 01:26.560
some of our life's journey to people.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.800
And so therefore, I know you have a really interesting story to tell.

01:30.800 --> 01:36.840
So I'm going to keep quiet and start wherever you feel like.

01:36.840 --> 01:44.320
And just tell us, who is Rian Johnson, where you come from, and how did you get to today?

01:44.320 --> 01:47.520
Yeah, that's a great question.

01:47.520 --> 01:56.360
It's especially fun talking to you about it, because I know of your background in music

01:56.360 --> 01:58.360
and really accomplished in music.

01:58.360 --> 02:05.840
And I always thought that was just so cool that you've got that artistic, cultural background,

02:05.840 --> 02:11.160
and then you bring that to technology, because I can relate to that somewhat.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.160
Yeah.

02:12.160 --> 02:23.720
When I started off in technology, I always tell people that the reason I got into technology

02:23.720 --> 02:33.600
was because I was very interested in humanities, writing, and art, and all that stuff.

02:33.600 --> 02:39.000
But I think technology attracted me initially when I was young.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.800
And a teenager was just because of the chance to make good money.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.120
I came from a poor family.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.360
And so that was one aspect.

02:50.360 --> 02:56.720
But also, I think in a sense, that's kind of an external thing, really.

02:56.720 --> 03:05.000
But from an internal point of view, I thought it was a chance to create some things.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.200
I guess I was always attracted to engineering from the creative aspect of it.

03:13.200 --> 03:21.640
And then also, I remember being really attracted to computers, really, from the point of view

03:21.640 --> 03:22.640
of...

03:22.640 --> 03:29.400
I had heard about artificial intelligence way back then, and that intrigued me.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.480
How is it that computers think what?

03:33.480 --> 03:34.480
What is that?

03:34.480 --> 03:35.480
What does that mean?

03:35.480 --> 03:37.960
And I was always intrigued by that.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.640
And I wanted to get to the bottom of it.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.920
So there was a philosophical aspect to it as well.

03:42.920 --> 03:51.680
And I think that's probably maybe the biggest core of who I am is maybe I'm more attracted

03:51.680 --> 03:54.440
to philosophy and psychology and things like that.

03:54.440 --> 04:01.800
But technology was my way to make a living and get myself...

04:01.800 --> 04:07.520
We weren't in poverty, but we just didn't have money as a family.

04:07.520 --> 04:18.680
So I went into electrical engineering, and specifically what I kind of focused on...

04:18.680 --> 04:25.160
I was never really into voltage and current and all that kind of stuff.

04:25.160 --> 04:29.000
But what I was really interested in was computers.

04:29.000 --> 04:38.440
And again, because of this angle of what is a computer and what makes it tick?

04:38.440 --> 04:47.360
And so I focused on computer hardware, but we did computer hardware and software in college.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.720
And I thought I was really fascinated by it.

04:50.720 --> 04:57.120
And I enjoyed especially the digital systems point of view.

04:57.120 --> 05:03.920
And I remember in my sophomore year of college, the light bulb came on and how hardware works.

05:03.920 --> 05:07.000
And that was kind of cool.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.360
So the college was electrical engineering, really a focus on computer hardware and software,

05:13.360 --> 05:14.600
mostly computer hardware.

05:14.600 --> 05:19.740
And I got out of college and I just wanted to do computer hardware.

05:19.740 --> 05:26.180
And I started working for a company called Zycad, they were a little startup in Minnesota.

05:26.180 --> 05:29.800
And I don't know if you remember, there was a big computer company in Minnesota called

05:29.800 --> 05:33.920
Control Data, and they made these large mainframes.

05:33.920 --> 05:38.840
And a few of the engineers from Control Data had started this company called Zycad.

05:38.840 --> 05:46.600
And they were making this basically this supercomputer.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.360
And I thought it was really kind of a cool...

05:49.360 --> 05:54.360
It was very small at the time, and I joined when it was very small.

05:54.360 --> 06:01.480
And so anyway, so that was fun.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.720
It was interesting.

06:02.720 --> 06:07.920
And I learned a lot about hardware systems and designing hardware systems.

06:07.920 --> 06:15.160
But I also kind of began to realize that the only people that really get to do the creative

06:15.160 --> 06:21.760
work in hardware systems are just kind of at the top of the pyramid.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.000
And that started my transition, basically.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.640
Then I did that for a while.

06:26.640 --> 06:35.480
And then I think another, I guess, source of discontent was I was feeling like I spent

06:35.480 --> 06:43.180
so much time studying tech, and I didn't really get to explore the humanities side of my personality.

06:43.180 --> 06:49.520
So I said, I'm gonna start working in what we call within the hardware realm, we call

06:49.520 --> 06:52.840
the applications engineering, which is you kind of work with the customers more.

06:52.840 --> 06:56.260
It's very technical, but you work more with people.

06:56.260 --> 06:57.960
So I did that for a while.

06:57.960 --> 07:03.320
And then eventually I just thought, I don't know if I'm kind of sick of tech.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.760
And so I started studying...

07:07.760 --> 07:15.840
This will be crazy, but I started studying jazz guitar at the time and just thinking,

07:15.840 --> 07:21.560
I'm just gonna quit my job and study jazz guitar and just figure out what to do next

07:21.560 --> 07:23.200
after that.

07:23.200 --> 07:27.360
And so I did, I quit my job.

07:27.360 --> 07:35.360
And then, crazy enough, it's a long story, so I won't go into it, but I landed at this

07:35.360 --> 07:42.960
Benedictine monastery out in the West Coast just as a guest.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.960
They had this kind of thing where you could just go there as a guest and live there and

07:46.960 --> 07:49.920
work there for a year.

07:49.920 --> 07:56.640
So I did that, and that was really, that was just fun, it was a great time to just kind

07:56.640 --> 07:57.640
of...

07:57.640 --> 08:05.600
I just became basically a farm hand, I milk cows and just read books and thought and stuff

08:05.600 --> 08:06.600
like that.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.600
So it was really great.

08:07.600 --> 08:12.600
That's fascinating.

08:12.600 --> 08:18.760
But then, after a year of that, I was like, I wanna get back to life.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.320
And so I thought, I'm gonna go into psychology.

08:21.320 --> 08:27.800
So then I went and got my master's degree in counseling psychology.

08:27.800 --> 08:33.080
And I just kind of had thought, I'm done with tech.

08:33.080 --> 08:37.240
And it felt good, actually.

08:37.240 --> 08:42.000
It felt more who I was.

08:42.000 --> 08:50.080
And I remember I finished my master's degree, and working as a psychologist, as a therapist,

08:50.080 --> 08:51.880
it's kind of hard to make a living.

08:51.880 --> 08:56.240
So I was faced with like, well, how do I get a job?

08:56.240 --> 08:59.320
How do I make money?

08:59.320 --> 09:07.160
And some friends who were living in San Diego had started this little software company called

09:07.160 --> 09:15.680
Cabinet Solutions, basically software for people who design cabinets, kitchen cabinets.

09:15.680 --> 09:21.960
And they were just tiny, barely making a living, living near the beach in Carlsbad and San

09:21.960 --> 09:22.960
Diego.

09:22.960 --> 09:30.880
And they're like, hey, come on out to California and work with us while you figure out what

09:30.880 --> 09:32.360
you wanna do.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.680
So I did, I just went out there.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.880
And it was kind of a shock at first, actually, because I'd given up on...

09:39.880 --> 09:44.560
I hadn't followed tech or done anything in tech.

09:44.560 --> 09:50.280
So I started programming in C, C++.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.840
And it was really rough at the first.

09:51.840 --> 09:56.480
And I remember just like, I started working with them, and then I thought, oh, I can't

09:56.480 --> 09:57.480
do this.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.240
But they talked me into it, you know.

10:00.240 --> 10:01.240
So I kept going.

10:01.240 --> 10:09.560
And sort of fast forwarding more is that I kind of just got pulled into software, which

10:09.560 --> 10:18.200
I liked, because I thought software is like this space where everyone can be more creative.

10:18.200 --> 10:24.320
And I think especially in the world that we're in, that you know even better than I do, Skulk,

10:24.320 --> 10:33.400
is the open source world we're in, where everybody's creating these really high quality packages

10:33.400 --> 10:34.400
of software.

10:34.400 --> 10:41.240
And for me, I know the Python world the best, but also the JavaScript world, of course.

10:41.240 --> 10:51.960
But it's pretty amazing, the industry really depends on these really high quality open

10:51.960 --> 10:52.960
source packages.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.680
Yeah, the world runs on open source.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.280
Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

10:58.280 --> 11:00.120
So it's like, I thought that was really cool.

11:00.120 --> 11:04.040
And I still think that's really amazing, you know, that I feel like the software space

11:04.040 --> 11:08.520
is so much more creative, you know.

11:08.520 --> 11:13.840
And I was slow to realize that, you know, having been initially attracted to the hardware

11:13.840 --> 11:16.480
side.

11:16.480 --> 11:26.120
But yeah, my journey from there was, I think my first, I was working for a company called

11:26.120 --> 11:32.040
Boston Scientific, but when I joined, they were called Guidant, they were in Minnesota,

11:32.040 --> 11:37.400
and they were a medical device, you know, pacemaker, defibrillator manufacturer.

11:37.400 --> 11:43.440
And that was really a cool place to work too, because, you know, it's just this new realm

11:43.440 --> 11:50.840
of medical related and hardware, software.

11:50.840 --> 11:57.880
And I was doing kind of software related stuff that was, I mean, I was working with software

11:57.880 --> 12:03.840
that was kind of related to the hardware, the quality of the hardware.

12:03.840 --> 12:08.600
And it was there that I really discovered Python through a friend.

12:08.600 --> 12:14.600
And again, I was starting to kind of get tired of technology, and, you know, I think that's

12:14.600 --> 12:19.000
one of the main themes of my tech path is just Python.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.960
I just fell in love with it.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.840
I just love the language.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.160
I love the ecosystem.

12:25.160 --> 12:31.360
I remember Django was just coming out, you know, the web framework.

12:31.360 --> 12:38.120
And you know, I remember taking a class in Django way back then, you know, it was like,

12:38.120 --> 12:44.320
one of the very earliest Django versions.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.520
And that just got me hooked.

12:45.520 --> 12:51.880
And I just, you know, I remember just telling my wife, like, I'm done, I'm only going to

12:51.880 --> 12:56.600
take jobs that are related to Python from now on.

12:56.600 --> 13:01.240
And so then I got this job at Seagate, again, kind of related.

13:01.240 --> 13:12.120
They were trying to make non-volatile memory, but much denser in a research project.

13:12.120 --> 13:16.560
And I came on as sort of, you know, working with Python to help them with their testing

13:16.560 --> 13:18.160
and things like that.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.000
So I did that for a while.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.640
They Seagate eventually closed that.

13:23.640 --> 13:33.280
And then the real big break for me was I saw an opening at Lucasfilm in the Bay Area.

13:33.280 --> 13:38.480
And I said, oh, man, that's, you know, that would just be a dream job.

13:38.480 --> 13:43.320
And it seemed so perfect, too, because they were really a heavy Python shop.

13:43.320 --> 13:51.280
So I applied and was, you know, pleasantly surprised that I got, you know, an interview.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.520
I still remember just all the details of flying out there.

13:55.520 --> 14:02.640
The Lucasfilm, they have several campuses, but the main campus was right in the Presidio.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.160
It's freaking gorgeous.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.660
It's amazing.

14:06.660 --> 14:10.860
And I remember flying out there and, you know, it was just fabulous.

14:10.860 --> 14:13.200
And I hit it off with a team.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.800
So anyway, I got the job and went out there.

14:16.800 --> 14:25.800
And that really shaped me, I think, more than anything other than Mozilla, you know, just

14:25.800 --> 14:31.400
because the team there was fantastic.

14:31.400 --> 14:36.800
And my manager there, Lori Giannino, who's still there, a lot of this team, the team

14:36.800 --> 14:39.640
that I worked with, a lot of that team is still there.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.640
They were just fabulous.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.640
Lori is just probably, you know, one of the best managers, well, definitely one of the

14:44.640 --> 14:46.520
best managers I've ever worked with.

14:46.520 --> 14:54.800
Jeff O'Dell was a manager there, just great people, great technology, you know, fun space

14:54.800 --> 15:01.600
because we basically built Python software to help manage, you know, movie, the movie

15:01.600 --> 15:04.800
production process.

15:04.800 --> 15:09.120
And so I worked all my time there, I worked with Industrial Light and Magic.

15:09.120 --> 15:14.160
So I got to meet some, you know, fascinating people, you know, that are kind of semi-famous

15:14.160 --> 15:20.280
in the movie industry, you know, visual effects supervisors.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.920
And it was really, it was fabulous.

15:21.920 --> 15:27.960
And the team was, it was like one of those cases where I just felt like I fell into,

15:27.960 --> 15:37.360
you know, we actually fell into something that was, you know, really great, great team,

15:37.360 --> 15:43.520
great people, great organization, you know, fascinating work.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.680
But of course, the downside, it was, the plus side and the downside is it was in the Bay

15:47.680 --> 15:53.880
Area because the plus side is I love the Bay Area, I love the weather, the location, the

15:53.880 --> 15:54.880
city.

15:54.880 --> 16:04.160
The downside is it's so, you know, expensive that it's so hard to kind of plant roots there.

16:04.160 --> 16:10.640
But anyway, you know, and then from there, you know, basically have to leave Lucasfilm

16:10.640 --> 16:18.640
just for the reasons of trying to, you know, buy a house.

16:18.640 --> 16:22.160
So I took a, I left Lucasfilm and went to work, one of my friends at Lucasfilm went

16:22.160 --> 16:25.760
to work for a biotech company called Twist Bioscience.

16:25.760 --> 16:31.920
They're building synthetic DNA for biotech research.

16:31.920 --> 16:41.640
So I went to work for them for about six months, and I would love to get into some of that

16:41.640 --> 16:46.480
because that's another theme I wanted to talk to you about, Skulk.

16:46.480 --> 16:54.160
Anyway, I left Twist Bioscience and went, came to Portland, Oregon, and eventually landed

16:54.160 --> 16:55.160
at Mozilla.

16:55.160 --> 17:02.280
And to me, the two great places I've been at are Lucasfilm, Mozilla, and like you said,

17:02.280 --> 17:06.680
I, you know, I had my early stand at Mozilla where you and I worked together on MDN Web

17:06.680 --> 17:13.920
Docs and then went off and worked for about six months at a quantum computing place called

17:13.920 --> 17:17.760
PsiQuantum, which is fascinating.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.640
And then now I'm back at Mozilla and I'm so grateful to be back because Mozilla is such

17:20.640 --> 17:27.840
a special place, you know, as you and I know, there's a lot of special people here that

17:27.840 --> 17:35.080
really care about, you know, the web and ethics and, you know, what's good for humanity in

17:35.080 --> 17:36.080
terms of technology.

17:36.080 --> 17:43.320
So anyway, I jumped all over the place, but I think another thing I wanted to touch on

17:43.320 --> 17:48.200
with you was, I think one of the themes throughout my whole career that's kind of driven what

17:48.200 --> 17:59.320
I do is just trying to find, I guess, a context in which to work in technology that feels

17:59.320 --> 18:05.920
humane, you know, like where the ends are humane and the way we work together as a team

18:05.920 --> 18:08.680
is humane.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.600
And that's been such a, you know, I'd love to talk to you about that because I feel like

18:12.600 --> 18:17.160
it's, that's one of the biggest challenges, I think, you know, like I think one of the

18:17.160 --> 18:24.480
questions you had, that you had, you know, kind of laid out that we could talk about

18:24.480 --> 18:26.960
was just like, what are the challenges in tech?

18:26.960 --> 18:34.000
And I feel like that's, that's to me, one of the biggest, you know, apart from the larger

18:34.000 --> 18:44.480
challenges of, you know, all the ethical dilemmas of, you know, big tech and social media and

18:44.480 --> 18:52.600
AI and all, you know, kind of the bubbles, you know, the kind of the worldview bubbles

18:52.600 --> 18:57.280
that you get into in social media and that kind of stuff, which everybody has been well

18:57.280 --> 19:02.600
documented and everybody, you know, hopefully knows about that, because those are huge,

19:02.600 --> 19:07.720
you know, I think world destabilizing kind of issues.

19:07.720 --> 19:14.400
But apart from that, I feel like one of the biggest challenges is just, I think, you know,

19:14.400 --> 19:21.280
I don't think in technology, we found a way to work together, you know, like, yeah, we're

19:21.280 --> 19:26.480
building technology, but it's a social endeavor, you know, you have to get a team together.

19:26.480 --> 19:32.040
Technology is so complex that you have to build teams and teams are groups of people.

19:32.040 --> 19:43.120
And I feel like we don't yet in tech have a good feeling for, you know, or I don't know,

19:43.120 --> 19:47.840
how would you say the scope, but I feel like we don't have a good appreciation for that,

19:47.840 --> 19:48.840
how important that is.

19:48.840 --> 19:55.680
And I think that's one of the things I love so much about Lucasfilm and my manager, Laurie

19:55.680 --> 20:00.280
Janino and Jeff, my managers there, Laurie Janino and Jeff Waddell, is that I feel like

20:00.280 --> 20:06.040
they were just very people centered, you know, like Laurie just felt like I'm going to build

20:06.040 --> 20:11.680
the team, the team is the most important thing, and the technology will come out of it, you

20:11.680 --> 20:14.680
know, and the technology will follow.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.520
And it's so rare.

20:17.520 --> 20:24.560
And I think that's something I've always been thinking about and chasing, you know.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.880
Yeah, I know for sure.

20:27.880 --> 20:35.800
I think one of the things that might have been contributing to this is, I don't know

20:35.800 --> 20:40.280
when exactly it started, but at some point, I think it might have been in the initial

20:40.280 --> 20:45.720
dot com bubble and burst, and then it followed on from there.

20:45.720 --> 20:49.960
It's this idea that you don't spend more than two years at a company.

20:49.960 --> 20:53.600
Like if you're longer at a company for two years, people start questioning like, what

20:53.600 --> 20:55.280
the heck, why are you still here?

20:55.280 --> 21:02.040
And I think because of that, you can never really build a culture because just as the

21:02.040 --> 21:08.040
culture starts forming, a bunch of people leave and new people enter.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.360
Totally agree.

21:09.360 --> 21:17.680
I think it's good to have movement, but I think there's too much turn.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.280
And so I think people get into it for the wrong reasons.

21:21.280 --> 21:27.280
But I think that is why places like Lucas Formezilla, and hopefully what I can create

21:27.280 --> 21:33.920
with the company I'm building, is somewhere where there's variety and where you're encouraged

21:33.920 --> 21:39.640
to come up with ideas, explore them, fail, and it's okay.

21:39.640 --> 21:45.520
I think in a lot of companies, while they say failure is good and the more you fail,

21:45.520 --> 21:50.000
the more you learn, oftentimes you'll find that it's not really true.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.160
If you do try something that doesn't work, it's rare that they're going to celebrate

21:56.160 --> 21:59.560
that failure.

21:59.560 --> 22:04.320
There's going to be a heck of a lot of questions that's going to follow that failure.

22:04.320 --> 22:09.820
And if you can't justify it, you're more often than not going to be out of a job.

22:09.820 --> 22:20.560
So I think that that's the problem is like companies are just, and I think a lot of people

22:20.560 --> 22:22.240
just do it for the money.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.200
And I think that's also incorrect.

22:24.200 --> 22:30.400
And I think it's got a lot to do with marketing around tech, where there's a narrative being

22:30.400 --> 22:38.400
spun that it's a way to get rich, you know, get a job in tech and just one, two, three

22:38.400 --> 22:42.560
years and you're going to be a millionaire and you can like quit and go sail a boat for

22:42.560 --> 22:44.000
the rest of your life.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.400
And sure, that happens to some folks, but those are not the rule.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.600
Those are the outliers by a big thing.

22:52.600 --> 22:58.200
And I think people keep chasing that and that's why they keep leaving and leaving and leaving

22:58.200 --> 23:02.680
because they're chasing something that, and I don't think that you should do it for that.

23:02.680 --> 23:09.500
I think we should, like you said, have humane ends and the means should be humane.

23:09.500 --> 23:14.280
So that we're building culture, we're building a group of people that believe in the product

23:14.280 --> 23:17.120
that we're building or the products that we're building.

23:17.120 --> 23:25.840
And I think open source maybe has more of this than working at a specific company.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.320
Some you're lucky to experience that, like Mozilla.

23:29.320 --> 23:34.640
Maybe that's why Mozilla has this theme, because it's largely open source.

23:34.640 --> 23:43.900
Because there's this dude, Ron Lanier, that is now, I believe, still at Microsoft Research.

23:43.900 --> 23:50.520
And he made the point that one of the most successful social networks is GitHub.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.360
They've somehow got it right.

23:53.360 --> 24:01.120
And he's thought around it is it's because there's a sense of ownership and there's

24:01.120 --> 24:07.200
this sense of co-creation and there's a creativity there.

24:07.200 --> 24:12.520
So while on social media you send a tweet and it's ephemeral, it just goes into the

24:12.520 --> 24:18.520
void and maybe nobody sees it, here you're creating something together that is having

24:18.520 --> 24:19.520
direct impact.

24:19.520 --> 24:24.040
Like MDN, for example, we're all building it with this big community of contributors.

24:24.040 --> 24:28.960
And it has a good feeling about it because we've heard so many times how people have

24:28.960 --> 24:32.640
told us how it's had an impact on their life.

24:32.640 --> 24:36.720
Like I was able to contribute and through that I got a job or I was able to learn because

24:36.720 --> 24:41.160
MDN is for free and now I was able to lift myself out of poverty.

24:41.160 --> 24:45.440
So when I think when you hear things like that and you work together as a group for

24:45.440 --> 24:53.560
long enough, it starts building a relationship with everybody.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.680
And then it's really hard to leave.

24:56.680 --> 25:03.920
I think everybody that's left the team in the last year or two, it was not easy.

25:03.920 --> 25:12.480
Beautifully said Skulk, you should be the subject of this podcast Skulk, I loved everything

25:12.480 --> 25:13.480
you said.

25:13.480 --> 25:18.240
It was beautifully said and you're absolutely right.

25:18.240 --> 25:28.160
I think you touched on one of the key things, it's just nobody stays any place long enough.

25:28.160 --> 25:35.320
And the two exceptions in my career have been Lucasfilm and Mozilla, where Lucasfilm, that

25:35.320 --> 25:40.720
same group like Lori is very protective of her group.

25:40.720 --> 25:49.640
And they've been together for 10, 15 years now and largely the same group is still there.

25:49.640 --> 25:55.080
And they really, like you said Skulk, it's all like you want to work in a community where

25:55.080 --> 26:02.800
you feel accepted and everybody wants to be accepted in the community and create something

26:02.800 --> 26:06.480
together.

26:06.480 --> 26:14.760
So yeah, I loved everything you said, I could just sit back and listen to you go on because

26:14.760 --> 26:19.840
I think that's so important and I think that's missing.

26:19.840 --> 26:28.640
I feel like that's, you said it so well, I feel like some open source projects have better

26:28.640 --> 26:32.120
communities than any companies do.

26:32.120 --> 26:36.080
Yeah, for sure.

26:36.080 --> 26:45.840
If I take a common month, because in this year I basically changed careers from a friendly

26:45.840 --> 26:54.080
engineer to a community manager and I mean, if I take the number of times that we've had

26:54.080 --> 27:00.280
somebody that's been not even necessarily toxic, but just disruptive as part of this

27:00.280 --> 27:08.480
massive open source project, one of the, what in the top 20 open source projects on GitHub,

27:08.480 --> 27:11.600
it's been like, I can count it on a single hand.

27:11.600 --> 27:18.800
And if you compare and contrast that with stuff you hear that happens inside companies,

27:18.800 --> 27:27.800
the way women are treated, the way people who are non-binary, and then also crazy things

27:27.800 --> 27:37.920
like people who have neurodiversity, who are being treated really unfairly and they have

27:37.920 --> 27:42.400
so much to contribute if you play to their strengths.

27:42.400 --> 27:49.280
But oftentimes our world and the companies that run the world are not set up for these

27:49.280 --> 27:55.080
people and then you lose that sense of you feel as an outsider and then it's hard to

27:55.080 --> 28:01.960
find, it's hard, everything becomes harder because I heard the other day, I spoke to

28:01.960 --> 28:07.200
Jennifer Riggins on a different podcast and she mentioned that they did some research

28:07.200 --> 28:14.560
and if you blinded people doing reviews, so you don't know the gender or anything about

28:14.560 --> 28:25.020
this pull request that you're reviewing, more pull requests of women are accepted than men.

28:25.020 --> 28:30.400
But if you take the blinders off, the opposite happens.

28:30.400 --> 28:36.600
Because there's also this weird thing with a female will not apply for a job unless she

28:36.600 --> 28:44.340
feels she meets 100% of the job description criteria, whereas the average man will apply

28:44.340 --> 28:51.040
if he meets only 65% of the criteria, which is crazy because we all know job descriptions

28:51.040 --> 28:52.040
are bogus.

28:52.040 --> 28:59.080
I mean, if you can literally fulfill everything they ask for, you're a superhuman.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.800
You're a superhuman, exactly.

29:01.800 --> 29:08.680
Because honestly, I can't believe, as we mentioned previously, some of the challenges in tech,

29:08.680 --> 29:18.720
I think that is still one of the biggest challenges is the interview process and how the job descriptions

29:18.720 --> 29:27.220
that people use are just unreasonable and it makes it super hard for people getting

29:27.220 --> 29:31.920
into tech, so it doesn't necessarily mean people are like in their early 20s.

29:31.920 --> 29:36.560
This can be somebody in their 40s that has been doing whatever for their whole life and

29:36.560 --> 29:39.960
just decided, I want to do something else and I decided to get into tech.

29:39.960 --> 29:44.840
That is one of the hardest things is they look at this world and they're like, where

29:44.840 --> 29:46.920
am I going to find my place?

29:46.920 --> 29:51.220
All these people want three, four, five years experience and they want me to have experience

29:51.220 --> 29:53.220
and databases and all these things.

29:53.220 --> 29:58.840
I did a boot camp, I have some basic knowledge and I can contribute to something.

29:58.840 --> 30:05.720
So you feel like you're running in molasses, as they say.

30:05.720 --> 30:12.400
The other crazy thing about our, and hopefully this won't last too long, but because of this

30:12.400 --> 30:21.960
insane layoffs that's happened in the last six months almost, there's this weird counterbalance

30:21.960 --> 30:28.000
that's happened in the tech industry where there are thousands of highly skilled people

30:28.000 --> 30:33.920
on the job market now and so all these new folks that got into engineering with promises

30:33.920 --> 30:40.960
of wealth and success now have to compete with these people for positions and so it's

30:40.960 --> 30:46.820
making their lives really, really tough and like me, I see that because I run this little

30:46.820 --> 30:51.540
this community and there's quite a number of people there that's exactly at this point

30:51.540 --> 30:57.080
where they're entering this market from as young folks or as people that was a lawyer

30:57.080 --> 31:03.880
for the last 10 years or whatever and they're scared that they might have made a mistake

31:03.880 --> 31:09.760
because they're looking at the situation and they're like, oh, I'm not so sure if I'm going

31:09.760 --> 31:11.400
to get a job.

31:11.400 --> 31:18.860
So you have to be, and it is tough, I don't lie to these people, I told them it is tough,

31:18.860 --> 31:26.560
but don't give up because there are companies out there that value the person over just

31:26.560 --> 31:31.720
the media labor of writing code every day that will take you in, that will give you

31:31.720 --> 31:37.320
an opportunity and allow you to grow inside the company because that's what you want.

31:37.320 --> 31:44.680
You want to take that person that's enthusiastic in and give them a place to grow because you

31:44.680 --> 31:52.080
as the company, you're going to, wow, you're going to reap the benefits of that big time.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.520
Yeah, wholeheartedly agree, Skollak.

31:55.520 --> 32:03.800
I feel like what's missing, one of the biggest, I mean, kind of a riff off what you've been

32:03.800 --> 32:08.400
saying, which I loved everything you said, is that I feel like one of the biggest challenges

32:08.400 --> 32:16.480
that I would love to be a part of the solution is, one of the biggest challenges we have

32:16.480 --> 32:28.880
is to create, I think you touched on it, almost all of tech is focused on just money, basically,

32:28.880 --> 32:29.880
profit.

32:29.880 --> 32:35.720
And I feel like we need a different model where obviously you have to make a living,

32:35.720 --> 32:37.520
we all have to make a living.

32:37.520 --> 32:44.360
So there is that side where you have to bring in income, but I feel like the focus should

32:44.360 --> 32:52.400
be more on building a community, an organization that's a community of people that really care

32:52.400 --> 32:55.360
about each other as people.

32:55.360 --> 33:02.360
And we also realize we have to make a living and we can use each other's talents and gifts

33:02.360 --> 33:11.200
as a community to make a living together and use tech, and tech is just sort of a way to

33:11.200 --> 33:12.200
do that.

33:12.200 --> 33:21.560
And then, I feel like that's so necessary, we need a new model, I think we need new experiments,

33:21.560 --> 33:25.680
I guess, to find new models where this will work.

33:25.680 --> 33:33.080
Mozilla is kind of one of those where it's not perfect, but it's different, it's different

33:33.080 --> 33:40.320
enough where I think there really is some sense of community there.

33:40.320 --> 33:49.400
Obviously I've seen the dark side too, but in the Bay Area, it's just too much driven

33:49.400 --> 33:51.720
by money, it's just pure money.

33:51.720 --> 33:58.280
And I was shocked at how cold-hearted that is, like you said, there is no sense of community,

33:58.280 --> 34:03.840
there is no sense of we're doing this for each other and for our customers.

34:03.840 --> 34:08.280
And I feel like that's missing sometimes, it's all about how do we achieve money rather

34:08.280 --> 34:15.080
than let's build something that's of value to our customers and of value to ourselves

34:15.080 --> 34:17.800
as a community that's making this.

34:17.800 --> 34:29.160
And it's almost like we need organizations that are more like small craft-oriented or

34:29.160 --> 34:36.840
places that are doing this out of the love of providing something for somebody and also

34:36.840 --> 34:43.080
a love of doing something together and creating something together and supporting each other.

34:43.080 --> 34:51.960
And what's sad is that often you talk about this and people roll their eyes and you know,

34:51.960 --> 34:58.080
oh yeah, the business world is cold and that's not going to fly, but it will fly.

34:58.080 --> 35:07.040
People do create excellent small companies, whether it's bakeries or whatever.

35:07.040 --> 35:12.020
And they do create successful organizations because they do focus on, hey, let's serve

35:12.020 --> 35:17.440
our customers something really good, something quality, but let's also care for each other

35:17.440 --> 35:20.840
in that process, like you and I were talking about.

35:20.840 --> 35:25.800
The end is good and the means is good in terms of getting there.

35:25.800 --> 35:31.520
And I feel like that's so hard to find, it's too hard to find in our industry.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.360
I think that's the biggest thing that young people face.

35:34.360 --> 35:41.280
Oh, one more thing I wanted to, sorry, my brain is firing from all this stuff.

35:41.280 --> 35:44.120
Yeah, no, go for it.

35:44.120 --> 35:51.480
But one of the things that's been inspiring me lately is I like jazz.

35:51.480 --> 35:57.840
And I love in the jazz community, there's a sense of, I think the jazz community has

35:57.840 --> 36:04.640
such a healthy, there's something really healthy about it, more than I've seen in other places

36:04.640 --> 36:15.560
where the elders of the jazz community, the greats, they feel this responsibility to bring

36:15.560 --> 36:23.520
in the young, the people that are entering jazz and to kind of take them under the wing.

36:23.520 --> 36:30.480
And then the young also feel like they need to respect the tradition, the Coltrane's or

36:30.480 --> 36:40.600
whatever, Miles Davis, and they need to kind of absorb what they've done and respect them.

36:40.600 --> 36:46.320
But what was interesting is that the elders of the jazz community want them to, hey, you

36:46.320 --> 36:53.880
got to absorb where we've been, but you don't absorb it to copy us, you absorb it to take

36:53.880 --> 36:55.200
it where you want to go.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.200
Yeah, exactly.

36:56.200 --> 37:01.360
And I thought that was just so beautiful, that balance between creating something new

37:01.360 --> 37:03.440
and respecting the tradition.

37:03.440 --> 37:10.360
And I feel like a lot of that applies to any organization or in tech, which is a creative

37:10.360 --> 37:11.360
industry.

37:11.360 --> 37:15.320
Yeah, you've got to kind of absorb the tradition.

37:15.320 --> 37:20.520
You've got to look at, for example, in the Python world, hey, how did Django build this

37:20.520 --> 37:29.240
framework? And how did they go about doing this? How did the Django folks do this? And

37:29.240 --> 37:33.400
then look at the code, look at the way they organize themselves, look at the community

37:33.400 --> 37:39.480
they've built, and then digest that and then say, how can we make this even better? Where

37:39.480 --> 37:42.320
can we take it from there?

37:42.320 --> 37:49.560
I think that's just so cool about jazz. And I feel like that's not, it's not really there

37:49.560 --> 37:51.960
in the tech community. There isn't a sense of like...

37:51.960 --> 37:57.560
Yeah, it's unfortunate, right? I mean, because I totally get what you're saying. And I think

37:57.560 --> 38:04.240
a lot of the craft industries are getting a drive. And here it's like, insert whatever

38:04.240 --> 38:11.800
product like craft coffee, craft bakeries, craft beer, craft teas, all these things.

38:11.800 --> 38:19.480
I think what I've seen in a lot of these places, when I look at their, the way they share,

38:19.480 --> 38:25.440
what they've accomplished, they always celebrate each and every person that's there. And I

38:25.440 --> 38:32.280
think being smaller net helps there. Like there's a point where you get too big, which

38:32.280 --> 38:37.840
is something that I'm very, very conscious of, is I think there's some point where you

38:37.840 --> 38:43.600
have to ask yourself the question of how much is enough? Because I think some people have

38:43.600 --> 38:49.560
forgotten to ask that question. And there's some people in this world that have more than

38:49.560 --> 38:58.480
is really fair. So you have to ask yourself the question of when do I have enough? Because

38:58.480 --> 39:03.920
there is a saturation point for all of us. And it might differ from one person to the

39:03.920 --> 39:11.880
other, but I think it kind of tops out at a certain point. And then how big is big enough

39:11.880 --> 39:17.280
if you're creating a company? And I think there, it also differs, but I think there's

39:17.280 --> 39:22.760
also, again, there's saturation point. I think as soon as you lose touch with the people,

39:22.760 --> 39:30.920
you're getting too big. As soon as the people aspect starts getting lost in process and

39:30.920 --> 39:37.880
I don't know, policy, you probably should start looking at the bigger picture and ask

39:37.880 --> 39:42.000
are we getting too big? Should we slow down? And most likely the answer is going to be

39:42.000 --> 39:48.920
yes. Because the other big thing that I see in those things is the sense of community.

39:48.920 --> 39:55.320
And what do you want in a community? You want everybody to succeed. There's no community

39:55.320 --> 40:01.920
formed around the idea that I want to push you down so that I can be on top. That is

40:01.920 --> 40:06.680
not what a community is about. When you're in a community, you want to lift everybody

40:06.680 --> 40:12.480
up. So if somebody in the community is struggling, you're going to say, how can we help? So you

40:12.480 --> 40:20.000
will naturally, it's almost crazy that we're not doing it this way. Because it seems to

40:20.000 --> 40:27.560
me it's a better recipe for success than focusing on material wealth. Because there you quickly

40:27.560 --> 40:33.520
get to the doggy dog world. I think you get to the doggy dog world very quickly and then

40:33.520 --> 40:39.200
it gets toxic. Whereas if you're in this community thing, everybody is there to make sure that

40:39.200 --> 40:45.480
everybody succeeds and whatever success means for you. But it's important that you understand

40:45.480 --> 40:49.960
what success means to somebody else so that you can support them in that journey. And

40:49.960 --> 40:56.400
they will naturally do it back because that's how karma works. That's how we as human beings

40:56.400 --> 41:10.200
work. If I feel that you have my best in your head, then I will do the same for you. But

41:10.200 --> 41:15.440
if I feel attacked by you, then I might naturally attack back. Because our little lizard brain

41:15.440 --> 41:21.160
will kick in and say, danger, we need to either run or we need to fight back. And I think

41:21.160 --> 41:27.800
you know that while having studied psychology. So that is actually quite an interesting inflection

41:27.800 --> 41:36.400
point there. How does that knowledge you gained studying counseling psychology, do you find

41:36.400 --> 41:44.160
it useful that you know that in the tech world? Does it help you deal with some things?

41:44.160 --> 41:49.720
I mean, I think you've already touched on a lot of it, Scott. You said it so beautifully

41:49.720 --> 42:06.560
really is. I think technology is, the people in tech are too focused on the tech. And they're

42:06.560 --> 42:16.320
not focused enough on the community. They're not focused enough on that. We can't build

42:16.320 --> 42:23.040
anything of value unless we do it together with a community of people. And it's too often

42:23.040 --> 42:35.400
focused on who's the best. They get all the spoils. It isn't like, hey, we did this together.

42:35.400 --> 42:41.280
It's just like, oh, Tesla is Elon Musk. No, it's not Elon Musk. It's like a whole group

42:41.280 --> 42:53.240
of people creating something. I feel like that's what psychology is. The study of that

42:53.240 --> 43:00.440
is helped in the sense of this. You see the complexity of doing something together as

43:00.440 --> 43:05.960
a community of people. People have different motivations. They have different interests

43:05.960 --> 43:14.760
and different talents. And that is to me so fascinating. It's just during that stint when

43:14.760 --> 43:22.080
I was managing the engineering team at MDN Webbox, I loved it from that point of view.

43:22.080 --> 43:28.560
I would love to be, I think management interests me just from that point of view. How do you

43:28.560 --> 43:35.920
build a community and have people feel like they're doing what they want to do and can

43:35.920 --> 43:42.320
contribute in a way that appeals to their strengths? I think that's the side of psychology

43:42.320 --> 43:51.360
that's really fit in the tech world. And I feel like we need more of that. We need more

43:51.360 --> 44:01.840
engineers, people who are interested in tech who bring that focus of caring about not just

44:01.840 --> 44:08.280
the tech, but how we work together. And we've touched upon all that. And again, it goes

44:08.280 --> 44:15.440
back to your point, Skulk. I'm so glad you're a community manager now at MDN because I've

44:15.440 --> 44:21.720
always felt that from you. You always have had that strong sense of like, hey, we got

44:21.720 --> 44:29.080
to do this as a community. The community matters. But when the bottom line is quarterly profits,

44:29.080 --> 44:37.080
the community doesn't matter. Obviously, look at the way Musk has treated Twitter. The community

44:37.080 --> 44:45.800
doesn't matter at all. All that matters is tech and working hard and feeding the beast

44:45.800 --> 44:54.880
of quarterly profits. We can't survive as a, humanity can't survive if that's the model

44:54.880 --> 45:02.080
of organizations. It's crazy. Organizations are part of a larger thing called society

45:02.080 --> 45:11.920
and countries. And the way we organize ourselves as corporations, it matters a lot. It matters

45:11.920 --> 45:19.760
a lot for society. And people have to work in these kind of cold machines called corporations.

45:19.760 --> 45:27.780
I think a lot of the big tech companies are kind of colder than... Some are less cold

45:27.780 --> 45:34.040
than others, but they're pretty impersonal and can be pretty cold. And I think we need

45:34.040 --> 45:40.800
more of these smaller communities where there's more warmth and more support in each other

45:40.800 --> 45:46.640
while you're trying to make... You need that dual focus. You got to get a group of people

45:46.640 --> 45:53.360
together that really care about making something of value for others. I think that should be

45:53.360 --> 46:01.080
the focus. Hey, let's create something of real value for others and take joy in that.

46:01.080 --> 46:06.440
And then also take joy in, we're going to do that and make a living at the same time.

46:06.440 --> 46:12.800
The goal isn't to get rich. The goal is to put food on the table, support our families,

46:12.800 --> 46:22.680
enjoy life, participate in society, and then also create something of value for others.

46:22.680 --> 46:29.440
And I feel like that's... I think we need more of. We need that in the tech world. And

46:29.440 --> 46:39.000
it's not easy. I'm not saying it's easy. It's easy to put our finger on it. But I feel like...

46:39.000 --> 46:46.240
You've already said this better than I did, Skulk, but I feel like it's too focused right

46:46.240 --> 46:55.640
now on money and people get into it for the wrong reason of getting rich. And it should

46:55.640 --> 47:02.580
be more on like, hey, how can I support myself, support my colleagues, and do good things

47:02.580 --> 47:08.880
for the customer? Yeah, for sure. That's a much healthier approach.

47:08.880 --> 47:15.560
I think maybe we're at a point where the time is right to experiment, like you said. Experiment

47:15.560 --> 47:22.560
with some new ideas, some new ways of working. That's why I always like to, when I refer

47:22.560 --> 47:29.440
to the people that use MDN, I like to refer to them as readers as opposed to users. Because

47:29.440 --> 47:36.200
I think language matters, right? The language we use often changes how we think of something.

47:36.200 --> 47:40.840
So if you call somebody a user, you might think of their needs differently than you

47:40.840 --> 47:48.760
might if they're a reader or a learner. So I think language matters. And I think to some

47:48.760 --> 47:51.160
extent... That's really well said.

47:51.160 --> 47:56.200
We've kind of done some of that at Mozilla, but then it slips again. So we have to constantly

47:56.200 --> 48:04.680
remind ourselves that what we call the people that use our products, benefit from our products,

48:04.680 --> 48:09.600
we need to think about the language we use, because it's going to mentally flip switches.

48:09.600 --> 48:13.720
That's going to make you think about things. And I think then it's also important to see...

48:13.720 --> 48:19.360
I think that's what's kind of nice about Mozilla is this whole Mozilla-ians thing. You know,

48:19.360 --> 48:25.320
once a Mozilla, always a Mozilla-ian. I think that extends that. That is what I'm talking

48:25.320 --> 48:30.240
about, the language. That makes it feel more like it's not just a company. It's a bit more

48:30.240 --> 48:41.280
than that. But yeah, it's tough because sometimes the family is not that healthy. And then some

48:41.280 --> 48:49.280
things happen that's also not healthy for the family. But yeah, it's interesting.

48:49.280 --> 48:53.560
I know we're running low on time, Sculpeh. Just one more thing, the thought that occurred

48:53.560 --> 49:08.280
to me. I think it's maybe a good topic to end on. I feel like with technology becoming

49:08.280 --> 49:16.840
more powerful, artificial intelligence is incredible what that can do now. And the power

49:16.840 --> 49:25.640
of that to solve problems is incredible. And dabbling in quantum computing and working

49:25.640 --> 49:33.200
for that PsyQuantum for a bit, I see what's coming there. And that's incredible. Once

49:33.200 --> 49:39.800
a quantum computer is built that's usable, that can solve real problems. And one of the

49:39.800 --> 49:45.800
biggest focuses there is really chemistry. At PsyQuantum, the founders talk about quantum

49:45.800 --> 49:52.120
computing will be able to basically solve chemistry problems that are just absolutely

49:52.120 --> 49:58.600
impossible to solve. And you can actually engineer materials and that kind of thing.

49:58.600 --> 50:03.640
So there's a whole revolution coming in quantum computing. We're already in the middle of

50:03.640 --> 50:09.720
a revolution with artificial intelligence. That's all we all can talk about that and

50:09.720 --> 50:14.920
see that coming. But I think everything that you and I have been talking about, the community

50:14.920 --> 50:28.880
aspect and the way we organize our organizations, the way we create communities, I think because

50:28.880 --> 50:34.880
of these developments in tech, that's even a hundred times more important now. If we

50:34.880 --> 50:42.120
don't get that right, these powerful technologies of quantum computing and AI are going to be

50:42.120 --> 50:48.960
controlled by organizations that don't have a sense of community. All they do care about

50:48.960 --> 50:58.280
is getting rich and enriching a few. And that is dangerous. I guess my point is that it's

50:58.280 --> 51:05.160
so imperative that I think humanity in the tech world solves this problem of how do we

51:05.160 --> 51:16.480
organize ourselves in terms of providing value to people and make a living in a way that

51:16.480 --> 51:22.520
supports the external community outside the organization, as well as the internal community

51:22.520 --> 51:30.160
within the organization. I feel like if we don't do that as human beings, it's super

51:30.160 --> 51:38.120
dangerous. We've got these amazing, powerful technologies coming down the road and we don't

51:38.120 --> 51:46.440
have the organizational... How would you say this, Skoll? But we don't have that sense

51:46.440 --> 51:52.000
of community and how we organize ourselves yet. That hasn't kept up with it.

51:52.000 --> 52:02.080
No, it hasn't. Technology has run away with us. I totally agree. The big thing that is

52:02.080 --> 52:06.880
needed is ethics, right? Because a lot of things that's not happening is ethics. And

52:06.880 --> 52:14.360
I think if you build a healthy company with a sense of community and purpose, ethics comes

52:14.360 --> 52:25.640
built in. But if those core things that you just said are missing, then ethics become

52:25.640 --> 52:31.720
like accessibility, where it's bolted on and it doesn't really feel sincere. So I think

52:31.720 --> 52:38.480
you are 100% correct that the technology is evolving at the speed of light, but we need

52:38.480 --> 52:46.560
to step back and look at what are we doing with it and how are we treating each other

52:46.560 --> 52:52.880
in this process. Because a lot of the technologies we've built are toxic to us as human beings

52:52.880 --> 52:59.960
and to our children and all of this. And it's simply because it's run away. We've lost touch

52:59.960 --> 53:07.880
with it and it's evolved to a point where it's out of control. But all is not lost.

53:07.880 --> 53:13.120
I think the fact that me and you can have a conversation about this and be in agreement

53:13.120 --> 53:19.360
on this means there are more people that will also feel this way. And connecting all of

53:19.360 --> 53:27.840
those people will build up a momentum that can then drive a change. Thanks so much, Ryan,

53:27.840 --> 53:33.840
for this lovely conversation. Thank you, Skalk. I'm just energized after talking to you. I'm

53:33.840 --> 53:40.560
serious. I could just go on for like two more hours. No, for sure. I was about to say that.

53:40.560 --> 53:48.400
So we'll definitely do this again, whether it's on a podcast or just because. But yeah,

53:48.400 --> 53:54.200
thanks so much and have a lovely rest of your day and all of the very, very best. Thanks

53:54.200 --> 54:22.520
so much, Skalk. It's really been a pleasure.
