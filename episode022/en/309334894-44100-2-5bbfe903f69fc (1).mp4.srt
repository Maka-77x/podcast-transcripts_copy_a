00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,960
Hey Ryan, welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,460
It's a pleasure to be here.

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,160
It's a pleasure to join you, Skulk.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,680
Yeah, pleasure's all mine.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,040
We haven't talked in way too long.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,840
I know, way too long.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Yeah.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,720
I know you from Mozilla, and for a long time we worked together on the MDN WebDocs project.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,520
And then you had a short period of time where you explored some other avenues, which we'll

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,560
talk about a bit later.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,120
And then you came back to the Fall and joined the Mozilla family again.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,160
So but I think since you rejoined, both of us have been heads down on a bunch of things

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,760
and never really got a chance to connect again.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,640
So I thought, what better way to reconnect than record a bloody podcast?

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,480
So I invited you and I was so happy when you said you are into it.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,400
So I'm looking forward to this.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Me too.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,880
It's an honor, Skulk.

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,560
So to get us started, I've sat in many meetings where we've introduced ourselves, where we

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,840
were both in the room, where we've introduced ourselves to other people, where we've shared

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,560
some of our life's journey to people.

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,800
And so therefore, I know you have a really interesting story to tell.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,840
So I'm going to keep quiet and start wherever you feel like.

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,320
And just tell us, who is Rian Johnson, where you come from, and how did you get to today?

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
Yeah, that's a great question.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:56,360
It's especially fun talking to you about it, because I know of your background in music

29
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,360
and really accomplished in music.

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,840
And I always thought that was just so cool that you've got that artistic, cultural background,

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,160
and then you bring that to technology, because I can relate to that somewhat.

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Yeah.

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:23,720
When I started off in technology, I always tell people that the reason I got into technology

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:33,600
was because I was very interested in humanities, writing, and art, and all that stuff.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,000
But I think technology attracted me initially when I was young.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,800
And a teenager was just because of the chance to make good money.

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,120
I came from a poor family.

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,360
And so that was one aspect.

39
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,720
But also, I think in a sense, that's kind of an external thing, really.

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:05,000
But from an internal point of view, I thought it was a chance to create some things.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,200
I guess I was always attracted to engineering from the creative aspect of it.

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:21,640
And then also, I remember being really attracted to computers, really, from the point of view

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
of...

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,400
I had heard about artificial intelligence way back then, and that intrigued me.

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,480
How is it that computers think what?

46
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
What is that?

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
What does that mean?

48
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,960
And I was always intrigued by that.

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,640
And I wanted to get to the bottom of it.

50
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,920
So there was a philosophical aspect to it as well.

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:51,680
And I think that's probably maybe the biggest core of who I am is maybe I'm more attracted

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,440
to philosophy and psychology and things like that.

53
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,800
But technology was my way to make a living and get myself...

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,520
We weren't in poverty, but we just didn't have money as a family.

55
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:18,680
So I went into electrical engineering, and specifically what I kind of focused on...

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,160
I was never really into voltage and current and all that kind of stuff.

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,000
But what I was really interested in was computers.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,440
And again, because of this angle of what is a computer and what makes it tick?

59
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:47,360
And so I focused on computer hardware, but we did computer hardware and software in college.

60
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,720
And I thought I was really fascinated by it.

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,120
And I enjoyed especially the digital systems point of view.

62
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,920
And I remember in my sophomore year of college, the light bulb came on and how hardware works.

63
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,000
And that was kind of cool.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,360
So the college was electrical engineering, really a focus on computer hardware and software,

65
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,600
mostly computer hardware.

66
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,740
And I got out of college and I just wanted to do computer hardware.

67
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,180
And I started working for a company called Zycad, they were a little startup in Minnesota.

68
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,800
And I don't know if you remember, there was a big computer company in Minnesota called

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,920
Control Data, and they made these large mainframes.

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,840
And a few of the engineers from Control Data had started this company called Zycad.

71
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,600
And they were making this basically this supercomputer.

72
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,360
And I thought it was really kind of a cool...

73
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,360
It was very small at the time, and I joined when it was very small.

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,480
And so anyway, so that was fun.

75
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,720
It was interesting.

76
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,920
And I learned a lot about hardware systems and designing hardware systems.

77
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,160
But I also kind of began to realize that the only people that really get to do the creative

78
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,760
work in hardware systems are just kind of at the top of the pyramid.

79
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,000
And that started my transition, basically.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,640
Then I did that for a while.

81
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:35,480
And then I think another, I guess, source of discontent was I was feeling like I spent

82
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:43,180
so much time studying tech, and I didn't really get to explore the humanities side of my personality.

83
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:49,520
So I said, I'm gonna start working in what we call within the hardware realm, we call

84
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,840
the applications engineering, which is you kind of work with the customers more.

85
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,260
It's very technical, but you work more with people.

86
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,960
So I did that for a while.

87
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,320
And then eventually I just thought, I don't know if I'm kind of sick of tech.

88
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,760
And so I started studying...

89
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:15,840
This will be crazy, but I started studying jazz guitar at the time and just thinking,

90
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,560
I'm just gonna quit my job and study jazz guitar and just figure out what to do next

91
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,200
after that.

92
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,360
And so I did, I quit my job.

93
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,360
And then, crazy enough, it's a long story, so I won't go into it, but I landed at this

94
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,960
Benedictine monastery out in the West Coast just as a guest.

95
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,960
They had this kind of thing where you could just go there as a guest and live there and

96
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,920
work there for a year.

97
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:56,640
So I did that, and that was really, that was just fun, it was a great time to just kind

98
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
of...

99
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:05,600
I just became basically a farm hand, I milk cows and just read books and thought and stuff

100
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
like that.

101
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
So it was really great.

102
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,600
That's fascinating.

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,760
But then, after a year of that, I was like, I wanna get back to life.

104
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,320
And so I thought, I'm gonna go into psychology.

105
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,800
So then I went and got my master's degree in counseling psychology.

106
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,080
And I just kind of had thought, I'm done with tech.

107
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,240
And it felt good, actually.

108
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,000
It felt more who I was.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,080
And I remember I finished my master's degree, and working as a psychologist, as a therapist,

110
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,880
it's kind of hard to make a living.

111
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,240
So I was faced with like, well, how do I get a job?

112
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,320
How do I make money?

113
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:07,160
And some friends who were living in San Diego had started this little software company called

114
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:15,680
Cabinet Solutions, basically software for people who design cabinets, kitchen cabinets.

115
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,960
And they were just tiny, barely making a living, living near the beach in Carlsbad and San

116
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Diego.

117
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:30,880
And they're like, hey, come on out to California and work with us while you figure out what

118
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,360
you wanna do.

119
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,680
So I did, I just went out there.

120
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,880
And it was kind of a shock at first, actually, because I'd given up on...

121
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,560
I hadn't followed tech or done anything in tech.

122
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,280
So I started programming in C, C++.

123
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,840
And it was really rough at the first.

124
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,480
And I remember just like, I started working with them, and then I thought, oh, I can't

125
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
do this.

126
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,240
But they talked me into it, you know.

127
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
So I kept going.

128
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:09,560
And sort of fast forwarding more is that I kind of just got pulled into software, which

129
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:18,200
I liked, because I thought software is like this space where everyone can be more creative.

130
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,320
And I think especially in the world that we're in, that you know even better than I do, Skulk,

131
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:33,400
is the open source world we're in, where everybody's creating these really high quality packages

132
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
of software.

133
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,240
And for me, I know the Python world the best, but also the JavaScript world, of course.

134
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:51,960
But it's pretty amazing, the industry really depends on these really high quality open

135
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
source packages.

136
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,680
Yeah, the world runs on open source.

137
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,280
Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

138
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,120
So it's like, I thought that was really cool.

139
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,040
And I still think that's really amazing, you know, that I feel like the software space

140
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,520
is so much more creative, you know.

141
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,840
And I was slow to realize that, you know, having been initially attracted to the hardware

142
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,480
side.

143
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:26,120
But yeah, my journey from there was, I think my first, I was working for a company called

144
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,040
Boston Scientific, but when I joined, they were called Guidant, they were in Minnesota,

145
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,400
and they were a medical device, you know, pacemaker, defibrillator manufacturer.

146
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,440
And that was really a cool place to work too, because, you know, it's just this new realm

147
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,840
of medical related and hardware, software.

148
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:57,880
And I was doing kind of software related stuff that was, I mean, I was working with software

149
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,840
that was kind of related to the hardware, the quality of the hardware.

150
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,600
And it was there that I really discovered Python through a friend.

151
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,600
And again, I was starting to kind of get tired of technology, and, you know, I think that's

152
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,000
one of the main themes of my tech path is just Python.

153
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,960
I just fell in love with it.

154
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,840
I just love the language.

155
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,160
I love the ecosystem.

156
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,360
I remember Django was just coming out, you know, the web framework.

157
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,120
And you know, I remember taking a class in Django way back then, you know, it was like,

158
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,320
one of the very earliest Django versions.

159
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,520
And that just got me hooked.

160
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,880
And I just, you know, I remember just telling my wife, like, I'm done, I'm only going to

161
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,600
take jobs that are related to Python from now on.

162
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,240
And so then I got this job at Seagate, again, kind of related.

163
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:12,120
They were trying to make non-volatile memory, but much denser in a research project.

164
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,560
And I came on as sort of, you know, working with Python to help them with their testing

165
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
and things like that.

166
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
So I did that for a while.

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,640
They Seagate eventually closed that.

168
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:33,280
And then the real big break for me was I saw an opening at Lucasfilm in the Bay Area.

169
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,480
And I said, oh, man, that's, you know, that would just be a dream job.

170
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,320
And it seemed so perfect, too, because they were really a heavy Python shop.

171
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:51,280
So I applied and was, you know, pleasantly surprised that I got, you know, an interview.

172
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,520
I still remember just all the details of flying out there.

173
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:02,640
The Lucasfilm, they have several campuses, but the main campus was right in the Presidio.

174
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,160
It's freaking gorgeous.

175
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,660
It's amazing.

176
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,860
And I remember flying out there and, you know, it was just fabulous.

177
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,200
And I hit it off with a team.

178
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,800
So anyway, I got the job and went out there.

179
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:25,800
And that really shaped me, I think, more than anything other than Mozilla, you know, just

180
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,400
because the team there was fantastic.

181
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,800
And my manager there, Lori Giannino, who's still there, a lot of this team, the team

182
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,640
that I worked with, a lot of that team is still there.

183
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
They were just fabulous.

184
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,640
Lori is just probably, you know, one of the best managers, well, definitely one of the

185
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,520
best managers I've ever worked with.

186
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:54,800
Jeff O'Dell was a manager there, just great people, great technology, you know, fun space

187
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,600
because we basically built Python software to help manage, you know, movie, the movie

188
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
production process.

189
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,120
And so I worked all my time there, I worked with Industrial Light and Magic.

190
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,160
So I got to meet some, you know, fascinating people, you know, that are kind of semi-famous

191
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,280
in the movie industry, you know, visual effects supervisors.

192
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,920
And it was really, it was fabulous.

193
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,960
And the team was, it was like one of those cases where I just felt like I fell into,

194
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:37,360
you know, we actually fell into something that was, you know, really great, great team,

195
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,520
great people, great organization, you know, fascinating work.

196
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,680
But of course, the downside, it was, the plus side and the downside is it was in the Bay

197
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,880
Area because the plus side is I love the Bay Area, I love the weather, the location, the

198
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
city.

199
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:04,160
The downside is it's so, you know, expensive that it's so hard to kind of plant roots there.

200
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,640
But anyway, you know, and then from there, you know, basically have to leave Lucasfilm

201
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:18,640
just for the reasons of trying to, you know, buy a house.

202
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,160
So I took a, I left Lucasfilm and went to work, one of my friends at Lucasfilm went

203
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,760
to work for a biotech company called Twist Bioscience.

204
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,920
They're building synthetic DNA for biotech research.

205
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:41,640
So I went to work for them for about six months, and I would love to get into some of that

206
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,480
because that's another theme I wanted to talk to you about, Skulk.

207
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,160
Anyway, I left Twist Bioscience and went, came to Portland, Oregon, and eventually landed

208
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
at Mozilla.

209
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,280
And to me, the two great places I've been at are Lucasfilm, Mozilla, and like you said,

210
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,680
I, you know, I had my early stand at Mozilla where you and I worked together on MDN Web

211
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:13,920
Docs and then went off and worked for about six months at a quantum computing place called

212
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,760
PsiQuantum, which is fascinating.

213
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,640
And then now I'm back at Mozilla and I'm so grateful to be back because Mozilla is such

214
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,840
a special place, you know, as you and I know, there's a lot of special people here that

215
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:35,080
really care about, you know, the web and ethics and, you know, what's good for humanity in

216
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
terms of technology.

217
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,320
So anyway, I jumped all over the place, but I think another thing I wanted to touch on

218
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,200
with you was, I think one of the themes throughout my whole career that's kind of driven what

219
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:59,320
I do is just trying to find, I guess, a context in which to work in technology that feels

220
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,920
humane, you know, like where the ends are humane and the way we work together as a team

221
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,680
is humane.

222
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,600
And that's been such a, you know, I'd love to talk to you about that because I feel like

223
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,160
it's, that's one of the biggest challenges, I think, you know, like I think one of the

224
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:24,480
questions you had, that you had, you know, kind of laid out that we could talk about

225
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,960
was just like, what are the challenges in tech?

226
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,000
And I feel like that's, that's to me, one of the biggest, you know, apart from the larger

227
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:44,480
challenges of, you know, all the ethical dilemmas of, you know, big tech and social media and

228
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:52,600
AI and all, you know, kind of the bubbles, you know, the kind of the worldview bubbles

229
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,280
that you get into in social media and that kind of stuff, which everybody has been well

230
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,600
documented and everybody, you know, hopefully knows about that, because those are huge,

231
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,720
you know, I think world destabilizing kind of issues.

232
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:14,400
But apart from that, I feel like one of the biggest challenges is just, I think, you know,

233
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,280
I don't think in technology, we found a way to work together, you know, like, yeah, we're

234
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,480
building technology, but it's a social endeavor, you know, you have to get a team together.

235
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,040
Technology is so complex that you have to build teams and teams are groups of people.

236
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:43,120
And I feel like we don't yet in tech have a good feeling for, you know, or I don't know,

237
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,840
how would you say the scope, but I feel like we don't have a good appreciation for that,

238
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
how important that is.

239
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:55,680
And I think that's one of the things I love so much about Lucasfilm and my manager, Laurie

240
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Janino and Jeff, my managers there, Laurie Janino and Jeff Waddell, is that I feel like

241
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,040
they were just very people centered, you know, like Laurie just felt like I'm going to build

242
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,680
the team, the team is the most important thing, and the technology will come out of it, you

243
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,680
know, and the technology will follow.

244
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,520
And it's so rare.

245
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:24,560
And I think that's something I've always been thinking about and chasing, you know.

246
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,880
Yeah, I know for sure.

247
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,800
I think one of the things that might have been contributing to this is, I don't know

248
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,280
when exactly it started, but at some point, I think it might have been in the initial

249
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,720
dot com bubble and burst, and then it followed on from there.

250
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,960
It's this idea that you don't spend more than two years at a company.

251
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,600
Like if you're longer at a company for two years, people start questioning like, what

252
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,280
the heck, why are you still here?

253
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:02,040
And I think because of that, you can never really build a culture because just as the

254
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:08,040
culture starts forming, a bunch of people leave and new people enter.

255
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,360
Totally agree.

256
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,680
I think it's good to have movement, but I think there's too much turn.

257
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,280
And so I think people get into it for the wrong reasons.

258
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,280
But I think that is why places like Lucas Formezilla, and hopefully what I can create

259
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,920
with the company I'm building, is somewhere where there's variety and where you're encouraged

260
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,640
to come up with ideas, explore them, fail, and it's okay.

261
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,520
I think in a lot of companies, while they say failure is good and the more you fail,

262
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,000
the more you learn, oftentimes you'll find that it's not really true.

263
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,160
If you do try something that doesn't work, it's rare that they're going to celebrate

264
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,560
that failure.

265
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,320
There's going to be a heck of a lot of questions that's going to follow that failure.

266
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,820
And if you can't justify it, you're more often than not going to be out of a job.

267
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:20,560
So I think that that's the problem is like companies are just, and I think a lot of people

268
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,240
just do it for the money.

269
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,200
And I think that's also incorrect.

270
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,400
And I think it's got a lot to do with marketing around tech, where there's a narrative being

271
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,400
spun that it's a way to get rich, you know, get a job in tech and just one, two, three

272
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,560
years and you're going to be a millionaire and you can like quit and go sail a boat for

273
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
the rest of your life.

274
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,400
And sure, that happens to some folks, but those are not the rule.

275
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,600
Those are the outliers by a big thing.

276
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,200
And I think people keep chasing that and that's why they keep leaving and leaving and leaving

277
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,680
because they're chasing something that, and I don't think that you should do it for that.

278
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,500
I think we should, like you said, have humane ends and the means should be humane.

279
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,280
So that we're building culture, we're building a group of people that believe in the product

280
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,120
that we're building or the products that we're building.

281
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:25,840
And I think open source maybe has more of this than working at a specific company.

282
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,320
Some you're lucky to experience that, like Mozilla.

283
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,640
Maybe that's why Mozilla has this theme, because it's largely open source.

284
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:43,900
Because there's this dude, Ron Lanier, that is now, I believe, still at Microsoft Research.

285
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:50,520
And he made the point that one of the most successful social networks is GitHub.

286
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,360
They've somehow got it right.

287
00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:01,120
And he's thought around it is it's because there's a sense of ownership and there's

288
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:07,200
this sense of co-creation and there's a creativity there.

289
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,520
So while on social media you send a tweet and it's ephemeral, it just goes into the

290
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:18,520
void and maybe nobody sees it, here you're creating something together that is having

291
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
direct impact.

292
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,040
Like MDN, for example, we're all building it with this big community of contributors.

293
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,960
And it has a good feeling about it because we've heard so many times how people have

294
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,640
told us how it's had an impact on their life.

295
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,720
Like I was able to contribute and through that I got a job or I was able to learn because

296
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,160
MDN is for free and now I was able to lift myself out of poverty.

297
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,440
So when I think when you hear things like that and you work together as a group for

298
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,560
long enough, it starts building a relationship with everybody.

299
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,680
And then it's really hard to leave.

300
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:03,920
I think everybody that's left the team in the last year or two, it was not easy.

301
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:12,480
Beautifully said Skulk, you should be the subject of this podcast Skulk, I loved everything

302
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
you said.

303
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,240
It was beautifully said and you're absolutely right.

304
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:28,160
I think you touched on one of the key things, it's just nobody stays any place long enough.

305
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:35,320
And the two exceptions in my career have been Lucasfilm and Mozilla, where Lucasfilm, that

306
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,720
same group like Lori is very protective of her group.

307
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:49,640
And they've been together for 10, 15 years now and largely the same group is still there.

308
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,080
And they really, like you said Skulk, it's all like you want to work in a community where

309
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:02,800
you feel accepted and everybody wants to be accepted in the community and create something

310
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,480
together.

311
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,760
So yeah, I loved everything you said, I could just sit back and listen to you go on because

312
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,840
I think that's so important and I think that's missing.

313
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:28,640
I feel like that's, you said it so well, I feel like some open source projects have better

314
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,120
communities than any companies do.

315
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,080
Yeah, for sure.

316
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:45,840
If I take a common month, because in this year I basically changed careers from a friendly

317
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:54,080
engineer to a community manager and I mean, if I take the number of times that we've had

318
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,280
somebody that's been not even necessarily toxic, but just disruptive as part of this

319
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:08,480
massive open source project, one of the, what in the top 20 open source projects on GitHub,

320
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,600
it's been like, I can count it on a single hand.

321
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,800
And if you compare and contrast that with stuff you hear that happens inside companies,

322
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:27,800
the way women are treated, the way people who are non-binary, and then also crazy things

323
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:37,920
like people who have neurodiversity, who are being treated really unfairly and they have

324
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,400
so much to contribute if you play to their strengths.

325
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:49,280
But oftentimes our world and the companies that run the world are not set up for these

326
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,080
people and then you lose that sense of you feel as an outsider and then it's hard to

327
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,960
find, it's hard, everything becomes harder because I heard the other day, I spoke to

328
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,200
Jennifer Riggins on a different podcast and she mentioned that they did some research

329
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,560
and if you blinded people doing reviews, so you don't know the gender or anything about

330
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:25,020
this pull request that you're reviewing, more pull requests of women are accepted than men.

331
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,400
But if you take the blinders off, the opposite happens.

332
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,600
Because there's also this weird thing with a female will not apply for a job unless she

333
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:44,340
feels she meets 100% of the job description criteria, whereas the average man will apply

334
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:51,040
if he meets only 65% of the criteria, which is crazy because we all know job descriptions

335
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
are bogus.

336
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:59,080
I mean, if you can literally fulfill everything they ask for, you're a superhuman.

337
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,800
You're a superhuman, exactly.

338
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:08,680
Because honestly, I can't believe, as we mentioned previously, some of the challenges in tech,

339
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:18,720
I think that is still one of the biggest challenges is the interview process and how the job descriptions

340
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:27,220
that people use are just unreasonable and it makes it super hard for people getting

341
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,920
into tech, so it doesn't necessarily mean people are like in their early 20s.

342
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,560
This can be somebody in their 40s that has been doing whatever for their whole life and

343
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,960
just decided, I want to do something else and I decided to get into tech.

344
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,840
That is one of the hardest things is they look at this world and they're like, where

345
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,920
am I going to find my place?

346
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,220
All these people want three, four, five years experience and they want me to have experience

347
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
and databases and all these things.

348
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,840
I did a boot camp, I have some basic knowledge and I can contribute to something.

349
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,720
So you feel like you're running in molasses, as they say.

350
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,400
The other crazy thing about our, and hopefully this won't last too long, but because of this

351
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:21,960
insane layoffs that's happened in the last six months almost, there's this weird counterbalance

352
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,000
that's happened in the tech industry where there are thousands of highly skilled people

353
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,920
on the job market now and so all these new folks that got into engineering with promises

354
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,960
of wealth and success now have to compete with these people for positions and so it's

355
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,820
making their lives really, really tough and like me, I see that because I run this little

356
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,540
this community and there's quite a number of people there that's exactly at this point

357
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:57,080
where they're entering this market from as young folks or as people that was a lawyer

358
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:03,880
for the last 10 years or whatever and they're scared that they might have made a mistake

359
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,760
because they're looking at the situation and they're like, oh, I'm not so sure if I'm going

360
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,400
to get a job.

361
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:18,860
So you have to be, and it is tough, I don't lie to these people, I told them it is tough,

362
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:26,560
but don't give up because there are companies out there that value the person over just

363
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,720
the media labor of writing code every day that will take you in, that will give you

364
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,320
an opportunity and allow you to grow inside the company because that's what you want.

365
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,680
You want to take that person that's enthusiastic in and give them a place to grow because you

366
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:52,080
as the company, you're going to, wow, you're going to reap the benefits of that big time.

367
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,520
Yeah, wholeheartedly agree, Skollak.

368
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:03,800
I feel like what's missing, one of the biggest, I mean, kind of a riff off what you've been

369
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,400
saying, which I loved everything you said, is that I feel like one of the biggest challenges

370
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:16,480
that I would love to be a part of the solution is, one of the biggest challenges we have

371
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:28,880
is to create, I think you touched on it, almost all of tech is focused on just money, basically,

372
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
profit.

373
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,720
And I feel like we need a different model where obviously you have to make a living,

374
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,520
we all have to make a living.

375
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:44,360
So there is that side where you have to bring in income, but I feel like the focus should

376
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:52,400
be more on building a community, an organization that's a community of people that really care

377
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,360
about each other as people.

378
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,360
And we also realize we have to make a living and we can use each other's talents and gifts

379
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:11,200
as a community to make a living together and use tech, and tech is just sort of a way to

380
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
do that.

381
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:21,560
And then, I feel like that's so necessary, we need a new model, I think we need new experiments,

382
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,680
I guess, to find new models where this will work.

383
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:33,080
Mozilla is kind of one of those where it's not perfect, but it's different, it's different

384
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:40,320
enough where I think there really is some sense of community there.

385
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:49,400
Obviously I've seen the dark side too, but in the Bay Area, it's just too much driven

386
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,720
by money, it's just pure money.

387
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,280
And I was shocked at how cold-hearted that is, like you said, there is no sense of community,

388
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:03,840
there is no sense of we're doing this for each other and for our customers.

389
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,280
And I feel like that's missing sometimes, it's all about how do we achieve money rather

390
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,080
than let's build something that's of value to our customers and of value to ourselves

391
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,800
as a community that's making this.

392
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:29,160
And it's almost like we need organizations that are more like small craft-oriented or

393
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:36,840
places that are doing this out of the love of providing something for somebody and also

394
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:43,080
a love of doing something together and creating something together and supporting each other.

395
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:51,960
And what's sad is that often you talk about this and people roll their eyes and you know,

396
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,080
oh yeah, the business world is cold and that's not going to fly, but it will fly.

397
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:07,040
People do create excellent small companies, whether it's bakeries or whatever.

398
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,020
And they do create successful organizations because they do focus on, hey, let's serve

399
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,440
our customers something really good, something quality, but let's also care for each other

400
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,840
in that process, like you and I were talking about.

401
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,800
The end is good and the means is good in terms of getting there.

402
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,520
And I feel like that's so hard to find, it's too hard to find in our industry.

403
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,360
I think that's the biggest thing that young people face.

404
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:41,280
Oh, one more thing I wanted to, sorry, my brain is firing from all this stuff.

405
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,120
Yeah, no, go for it.

406
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:51,480
But one of the things that's been inspiring me lately is I like jazz.

407
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,840
And I love in the jazz community, there's a sense of, I think the jazz community has

408
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:04,640
such a healthy, there's something really healthy about it, more than I've seen in other places

409
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:15,560
where the elders of the jazz community, the greats, they feel this responsibility to bring

410
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:23,520
in the young, the people that are entering jazz and to kind of take them under the wing.

411
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,480
And then the young also feel like they need to respect the tradition, the Coltrane's or

412
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:40,600
whatever, Miles Davis, and they need to kind of absorb what they've done and respect them.

413
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:46,320
But what was interesting is that the elders of the jazz community want them to, hey, you

414
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,880
got to absorb where we've been, but you don't absorb it to copy us, you absorb it to take

415
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,200
it where you want to go.

416
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Yeah, exactly.

417
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,360
And I thought that was just so beautiful, that balance between creating something new

418
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,440
and respecting the tradition.

419
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,360
And I feel like a lot of that applies to any organization or in tech, which is a creative

420
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
industry.

421
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,320
Yeah, you've got to kind of absorb the tradition.

422
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,520
You've got to look at, for example, in the Python world, hey, how did Django build this

423
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:29,240
framework? And how did they go about doing this? How did the Django folks do this? And

424
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,400
then look at the code, look at the way they organize themselves, look at the community

425
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,480
they've built, and then digest that and then say, how can we make this even better? Where

426
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,320
can we take it from there?

427
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:49,560
I think that's just so cool about jazz. And I feel like that's not, it's not really there

428
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,960
in the tech community. There isn't a sense of like...

429
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,560
Yeah, it's unfortunate, right? I mean, because I totally get what you're saying. And I think

430
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:04,240
a lot of the craft industries are getting a drive. And here it's like, insert whatever

431
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:11,800
product like craft coffee, craft bakeries, craft beer, craft teas, all these things.

432
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:19,480
I think what I've seen in a lot of these places, when I look at their, the way they share,

433
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,440
what they've accomplished, they always celebrate each and every person that's there. And I

434
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,280
think being smaller net helps there. Like there's a point where you get too big, which

435
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,840
is something that I'm very, very conscious of, is I think there's some point where you

436
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,600
have to ask yourself the question of how much is enough? Because I think some people have

437
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:49,560
forgotten to ask that question. And there's some people in this world that have more than

438
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:58,480
is really fair. So you have to ask yourself the question of when do I have enough? Because

439
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,920
there is a saturation point for all of us. And it might differ from one person to the

440
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:11,880
other, but I think it kind of tops out at a certain point. And then how big is big enough

441
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,280
if you're creating a company? And I think there, it also differs, but I think there's

442
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,760
also, again, there's saturation point. I think as soon as you lose touch with the people,

443
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:30,920
you're getting too big. As soon as the people aspect starts getting lost in process and

444
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,880
I don't know, policy, you probably should start looking at the bigger picture and ask

445
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,000
are we getting too big? Should we slow down? And most likely the answer is going to be

446
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,920
yes. Because the other big thing that I see in those things is the sense of community.

447
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:55,320
And what do you want in a community? You want everybody to succeed. There's no community

448
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:01,920
formed around the idea that I want to push you down so that I can be on top. That is

449
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,680
not what a community is about. When you're in a community, you want to lift everybody

450
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,480
up. So if somebody in the community is struggling, you're going to say, how can we help? So you

451
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:20,000
will naturally, it's almost crazy that we're not doing it this way. Because it seems to

452
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,560
me it's a better recipe for success than focusing on material wealth. Because there you quickly

453
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,520
get to the doggy dog world. I think you get to the doggy dog world very quickly and then

454
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,200
it gets toxic. Whereas if you're in this community thing, everybody is there to make sure that

455
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,480
everybody succeeds and whatever success means for you. But it's important that you understand

456
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,960
what success means to somebody else so that you can support them in that journey. And

457
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,400
they will naturally do it back because that's how karma works. That's how we as human beings

458
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:10,200
work. If I feel that you have my best in your head, then I will do the same for you. But

459
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,440
if I feel attacked by you, then I might naturally attack back. Because our little lizard brain

460
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,160
will kick in and say, danger, we need to either run or we need to fight back. And I think

461
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,800
you know that while having studied psychology. So that is actually quite an interesting inflection

462
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:36,400
point there. How does that knowledge you gained studying counseling psychology, do you find

463
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:44,160
it useful that you know that in the tech world? Does it help you deal with some things?

464
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,720
I mean, I think you've already touched on a lot of it, Scott. You said it so beautifully

465
00:41:49,720 --> 00:42:06,560
really is. I think technology is, the people in tech are too focused on the tech. And they're

466
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:16,320
not focused enough on the community. They're not focused enough on that. We can't build

467
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:23,040
anything of value unless we do it together with a community of people. And it's too often

468
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:35,400
focused on who's the best. They get all the spoils. It isn't like, hey, we did this together.

469
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,280
It's just like, oh, Tesla is Elon Musk. No, it's not Elon Musk. It's like a whole group

470
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:53,240
of people creating something. I feel like that's what psychology is. The study of that

471
00:42:53,240 --> 00:43:00,440
is helped in the sense of this. You see the complexity of doing something together as

472
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,960
a community of people. People have different motivations. They have different interests

473
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:14,760
and different talents. And that is to me so fascinating. It's just during that stint when

474
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:22,080
I was managing the engineering team at MDN Webbox, I loved it from that point of view.

475
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,560
I would love to be, I think management interests me just from that point of view. How do you

476
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:35,920
build a community and have people feel like they're doing what they want to do and can

477
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,320
contribute in a way that appeals to their strengths? I think that's the side of psychology

478
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:51,360
that's really fit in the tech world. And I feel like we need more of that. We need more

479
00:43:51,360 --> 00:44:01,840
engineers, people who are interested in tech who bring that focus of caring about not just

480
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:08,280
the tech, but how we work together. And we've touched upon all that. And again, it goes

481
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:15,440
back to your point, Skulk. I'm so glad you're a community manager now at MDN because I've

482
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,720
always felt that from you. You always have had that strong sense of like, hey, we got

483
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:29,080
to do this as a community. The community matters. But when the bottom line is quarterly profits,

484
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:37,080
the community doesn't matter. Obviously, look at the way Musk has treated Twitter. The community

485
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:45,800
doesn't matter at all. All that matters is tech and working hard and feeding the beast

486
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:54,880
of quarterly profits. We can't survive as a, humanity can't survive if that's the model

487
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:02,080
of organizations. It's crazy. Organizations are part of a larger thing called society

488
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:11,920
and countries. And the way we organize ourselves as corporations, it matters a lot. It matters

489
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:19,760
a lot for society. And people have to work in these kind of cold machines called corporations.

490
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,780
I think a lot of the big tech companies are kind of colder than... Some are less cold

491
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:34,040
than others, but they're pretty impersonal and can be pretty cold. And I think we need

492
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:40,800
more of these smaller communities where there's more warmth and more support in each other

493
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,640
while you're trying to make... You need that dual focus. You got to get a group of people

494
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,360
together that really care about making something of value for others. I think that should be

495
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:01,080
the focus. Hey, let's create something of real value for others and take joy in that.

496
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,440
And then also take joy in, we're going to do that and make a living at the same time.

497
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:12,800
The goal isn't to get rich. The goal is to put food on the table, support our families,

498
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:22,680
enjoy life, participate in society, and then also create something of value for others.

499
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:29,440
And I feel like that's... I think we need more of. We need that in the tech world. And

500
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:39,000
it's not easy. I'm not saying it's easy. It's easy to put our finger on it. But I feel like...

501
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,240
You've already said this better than I did, Skulk, but I feel like it's too focused right

502
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:55,640
now on money and people get into it for the wrong reason of getting rich. And it should

503
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:02,580
be more on like, hey, how can I support myself, support my colleagues, and do good things

504
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:08,880
for the customer? Yeah, for sure. That's a much healthier approach.

505
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,560
I think maybe we're at a point where the time is right to experiment, like you said. Experiment

506
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:22,560
with some new ideas, some new ways of working. That's why I always like to, when I refer

507
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:29,440
to the people that use MDN, I like to refer to them as readers as opposed to users. Because

508
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,200
I think language matters, right? The language we use often changes how we think of something.

509
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,840
So if you call somebody a user, you might think of their needs differently than you

510
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:48,760
might if they're a reader or a learner. So I think language matters. And I think to some

511
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,160
extent... That's really well said.

512
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,200
We've kind of done some of that at Mozilla, but then it slips again. So we have to constantly

513
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:04,680
remind ourselves that what we call the people that use our products, benefit from our products,

514
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,600
we need to think about the language we use, because it's going to mentally flip switches.

515
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,720
That's going to make you think about things. And I think then it's also important to see...

516
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,360
I think that's what's kind of nice about Mozilla is this whole Mozilla-ians thing. You know,

517
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:25,320
once a Mozilla, always a Mozilla-ian. I think that extends that. That is what I'm talking

518
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:30,240
about, the language. That makes it feel more like it's not just a company. It's a bit more

519
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:41,280
than that. But yeah, it's tough because sometimes the family is not that healthy. And then some

520
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:49,280
things happen that's also not healthy for the family. But yeah, it's interesting.

521
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,560
I know we're running low on time, Sculpeh. Just one more thing, the thought that occurred

522
00:48:53,560 --> 00:49:08,280
to me. I think it's maybe a good topic to end on. I feel like with technology becoming

523
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:16,840
more powerful, artificial intelligence is incredible what that can do now. And the power

524
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:25,640
of that to solve problems is incredible. And dabbling in quantum computing and working

525
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:33,200
for that PsyQuantum for a bit, I see what's coming there. And that's incredible. Once

526
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:39,800
a quantum computer is built that's usable, that can solve real problems. And one of the

527
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,800
biggest focuses there is really chemistry. At PsyQuantum, the founders talk about quantum

528
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:52,120
computing will be able to basically solve chemistry problems that are just absolutely

529
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:58,600
impossible to solve. And you can actually engineer materials and that kind of thing.

530
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,640
So there's a whole revolution coming in quantum computing. We're already in the middle of

531
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:09,720
a revolution with artificial intelligence. That's all we all can talk about that and

532
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,920
see that coming. But I think everything that you and I have been talking about, the community

533
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:28,880
aspect and the way we organize our organizations, the way we create communities, I think because

534
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,880
of these developments in tech, that's even a hundred times more important now. If we

535
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:42,120
don't get that right, these powerful technologies of quantum computing and AI are going to be

536
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:48,960
controlled by organizations that don't have a sense of community. All they do care about

537
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:58,280
is getting rich and enriching a few. And that is dangerous. I guess my point is that it's

538
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:05,160
so imperative that I think humanity in the tech world solves this problem of how do we

539
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:16,480
organize ourselves in terms of providing value to people and make a living in a way that

540
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,520
supports the external community outside the organization, as well as the internal community

541
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:30,160
within the organization. I feel like if we don't do that as human beings, it's super

542
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:38,120
dangerous. We've got these amazing, powerful technologies coming down the road and we don't

543
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:46,440
have the organizational... How would you say this, Skoll? But we don't have that sense

544
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:52,000
of community and how we organize ourselves yet. That hasn't kept up with it.

545
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:02,080
No, it hasn't. Technology has run away with us. I totally agree. The big thing that is

546
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,880
needed is ethics, right? Because a lot of things that's not happening is ethics. And

547
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:14,360
I think if you build a healthy company with a sense of community and purpose, ethics comes

548
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:25,640
built in. But if those core things that you just said are missing, then ethics become

549
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:31,720
like accessibility, where it's bolted on and it doesn't really feel sincere. So I think

550
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:38,480
you are 100% correct that the technology is evolving at the speed of light, but we need

551
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:46,560
to step back and look at what are we doing with it and how are we treating each other

552
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:52,880
in this process. Because a lot of the technologies we've built are toxic to us as human beings

553
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:59,960
and to our children and all of this. And it's simply because it's run away. We've lost touch

554
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:07,880
with it and it's evolved to a point where it's out of control. But all is not lost.

555
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,120
I think the fact that me and you can have a conversation about this and be in agreement

556
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:19,360
on this means there are more people that will also feel this way. And connecting all of

557
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:27,840
those people will build up a momentum that can then drive a change. Thanks so much, Ryan,

558
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:33,840
for this lovely conversation. Thank you, Skalk. I'm just energized after talking to you. I'm

559
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:40,560
serious. I could just go on for like two more hours. No, for sure. I was about to say that.

560
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:48,400
So we'll definitely do this again, whether it's on a podcast or just because. But yeah,

561
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,200
thanks so much and have a lovely rest of your day and all of the very, very best. Thanks

562
00:53:54,200 --> 00:54:22,520
so much, Skalk. It's really been a pleasure.
