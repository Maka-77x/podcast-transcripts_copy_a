Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage work developers

00:06.680 --> 00:09.880
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.200
Hey, Andrew.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.600
Thanks so much for joining me for today's podcast.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.600
How are you doing?

00:15.600 --> 00:19.040
Oh my goodness, I am doing fantastic.

00:19.040 --> 00:24.440
We've got a bright, sunshiny day out here on the west coast of Canada just before we

00:24.440 --> 00:25.960
move into our rainy season.

00:25.960 --> 00:32.200
So I'm having a good day, and I'm getting to talk to you too, which is a pretty fantastic

00:32.200 --> 00:35.400
way to start my weekend.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.920
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.760
Yeah, the weather over here is also pretty decent.

00:40.760 --> 00:45.680
It's hot, and it's too soon to be this hot, but I think the weekend is looking pretty

00:45.680 --> 00:46.680
decent.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.320
So yeah, that's good.

00:48.320 --> 00:55.640
So I found you on Polywork, I'm really appreciative to Polywork because I had this idea, I thought

00:55.640 --> 00:59.920
I'd just put it out there and see if people were interested, and I was overwhelmed by

00:59.920 --> 01:05.600
the response, so much so that I've been finding it hard to keep up with getting back to people

01:05.600 --> 01:08.560
and saying like, oh my goodness, yeah, let's do this.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.640
So you're one of the first folks that reached out, actually, and I read a little bit about

01:12.640 --> 01:16.840
your background, and I thought this is perfect for the show.

01:16.840 --> 01:22.260
So I'm not going to speak about who you are because you know you are better than me.

01:22.260 --> 01:26.920
So I'm going to listen and I'm going to let you take as much time as you need, go as far

01:26.920 --> 01:29.480
back as you want to, and tell us your story.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.040
Oh, I don't know about that.

01:31.040 --> 01:37.080
You might have gotten more about me from the backgrounds that I sent in than I'm even going

01:37.080 --> 01:38.280
to remember today.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.560
But yeah, I mean, I guess I'll start with kind of where I am now and maybe go a little

01:42.560 --> 01:43.600
bit further backwards.

01:43.600 --> 01:51.560
So I'm an educator based here in British Columbia, Canada, so just on the west coast of Canada,

01:51.560 --> 01:56.520
the big focus around technology education and educational technologies.

01:56.520 --> 02:04.160
So I've worked in the middle school, high school, post-secondary levels, and sort of

02:04.160 --> 02:07.880
throughout the entire time that I've been in the world of education and the world of

02:07.880 --> 02:13.440
sort of training other people to do it, I've spent sort of my entire career also just exploring

02:13.440 --> 02:14.440
technology.

02:14.440 --> 02:21.520
I mean, I remember my first job post-graduation from a non-tech related tech related degree

02:21.520 --> 02:25.680
was to build a website for an organization that I was working for.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.920
And it was kind of my first taste of what this looked like professionally.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.780
Yeah, yeah.

02:30.780 --> 02:38.200
So technology enthusiast, really passionate about exploring ways to get people excited

02:38.200 --> 02:42.680
about technology and to look at alternative ways of teaching people technology.

02:42.680 --> 02:48.400
And I also work in the industry as a community manager for a really amazing company here

02:48.400 --> 02:51.960
in Canada called Battlesnake, and I'm sure I'll get a chance to talk about them a little

02:51.960 --> 02:52.960
bit later.

02:52.960 --> 02:53.960
Yeah, for sure.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.760
I definitely want you to talk about that.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.160
I saw that and I was like, what is this?

02:58.160 --> 03:00.360
This sounds really interesting.

03:00.360 --> 03:05.560
So it's kind of cool because so you're a teacher that also teaches teachers, which is like

03:05.560 --> 03:06.560
inception.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.160
That's really cool.

03:08.160 --> 03:14.680
So as you know, the whole idea behind this podcast and the community that I've started

03:14.680 --> 03:23.800
is all about helping early stage developers get into this industry in a welcoming, friendly

03:23.800 --> 03:32.880
way and help them identify by talking to them, but also by talking to teachers and mentors,

03:32.880 --> 03:35.240
find where is the missing pieces?

03:35.240 --> 03:41.040
What are things that's not working so that we can find ways of improving this so that

03:41.040 --> 03:45.440
the pain, the struggles that we might have gone through when we started, we don't have

03:45.440 --> 03:49.280
to repeat that for the next wave of folks getting into the industry.

03:49.280 --> 03:55.520
And I think one of the things that's also very important to me is to invite and include

03:55.520 --> 04:00.560
everybody irrespective of where you are in your career development and irrespective of

04:00.560 --> 04:10.080
where you live and irrespective of your gender, your background, your choice of how you identify

04:10.080 --> 04:11.080
yourself.

04:11.080 --> 04:16.400
Like I want this to be a welcoming place for everybody where they can feel they can talk

04:16.400 --> 04:21.520
openly and freely about what works and what doesn't celebrate their wins and celebrate

04:21.520 --> 04:23.000
the failures.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.220
So that is a lot.

04:26.220 --> 04:32.720
With all of that said, as a teacher who teaches teachers, but also teaches students, what

04:32.720 --> 04:39.700
advice do you have for both those bodies, I guess, anything that in your time spent

04:39.700 --> 04:44.600
doing this, anything that you have found that's like maybe not worked so well and that you

04:44.600 --> 04:48.480
found like, oh, these are better ways of addressing.

04:48.480 --> 04:53.560
So either speak to students or specifically to the industry in general.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.200
Yeah, I mean, this was it's so funny.

04:57.200 --> 05:03.800
So I got to say, first off, I absolutely love that mission, this idea of inclusiveness and

05:03.800 --> 05:10.120
accessibility to this world, even though technology industry is everywhere and almost every company

05:10.120 --> 05:15.560
is a technology company now, particularly on the developer side, I mean, around certainly

05:15.560 --> 05:22.480
in North America, but I think around the world, it is still historically a very dominated

05:22.480 --> 05:24.320
by a very specific population.

05:24.320 --> 05:30.120
And so any initiatives that can be done that will enable people that are not coming from

05:30.120 --> 05:34.120
that dominant culture to enter this space, I think is incredibly important.

05:34.120 --> 05:38.880
So huge kudos for the Mycelium Network podcast and the work that you're doing in this space.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.880
All right.

05:39.880 --> 05:40.880
Yeah.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.880
So and then answer your question.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.800
So it's interesting.

05:43.800 --> 05:50.040
So this was exactly what you're talking about and the exact reason behind Mycelium

05:50.040 --> 05:56.720
Network was actually one of the big pieces behind one of the initiatives that I'm most

05:56.720 --> 06:02.360
proud of that I helped to develop in sort of this technology education space, which

06:02.360 --> 06:06.320
was a program called High Tech U.

06:06.320 --> 06:11.440
So it was a it's a program based out of the University of Victoria, which is a fairly

06:11.440 --> 06:17.840
large research intensive university here in here in Victoria, British Columbia has a really

06:17.840 --> 06:22.920
spectacular software engineering and computer science program.

06:22.920 --> 06:29.280
But much like the rest of the world, not necessarily turning out the number of folks that need

06:29.280 --> 06:35.520
to be to be produced at a post secondary institutions to prepare them for for industry and in many

06:35.520 --> 06:40.240
ways turning out the same type of people that are dominating the industry right now, which

06:40.240 --> 06:46.120
is not necessarily that sort of perpetuation cycle that we're looking to do.

06:46.120 --> 06:51.800
So with this initiative, it was very specifically focused on the exact thing that Mycelium is

06:51.800 --> 06:56.720
is sort of really focused on, which is how can we how can we create a safe, accessible

06:56.720 --> 07:02.940
environment that will enable folks that didn't necessarily see themselves in technology to

07:02.940 --> 07:09.160
find their place in the industry, be it as somebody working in customer support or somebody

07:09.160 --> 07:14.000
that's working on on back end, but helping them find a place.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.240
And I can go into detail about kind of what that program looked like.

07:17.240 --> 07:23.280
But I think the biggest the biggest thing that that came out of that initiative and I ran

07:23.280 --> 07:29.500
it for for three years and built it up with a great team was kind of counterintuitive

07:29.500 --> 07:31.800
to get people excited about tech.

07:31.800 --> 07:36.240
It's less about the tech itself and more about the problems that that technology can

07:36.240 --> 07:44.800
solve and really just enabling people to gain an understanding of how they can use these

07:44.800 --> 07:51.040
free amazing resources that are out there to solve a problem for them and switching

07:51.040 --> 07:56.680
this world of you need to be the sort of glasses in your basement with the hoodie eating, eating

07:56.680 --> 08:01.080
nacho chips and drinking soda, which we all love to do.

08:01.080 --> 08:05.640
But that's kind of that archetypical computer scientist look right.

08:05.640 --> 08:10.760
And so, yeah, yeah, we really focus there on on switching to the problem solving and

08:10.760 --> 08:14.520
then getting people excited about tech and then sort of showing them the different gateways

08:14.520 --> 08:15.600
that are there.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.600
That sounds great.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.640
Yeah, I'm totally for the problem solving thing, because I think one of the challenges

08:19.640 --> 08:25.320
that I've heard over and over and over again, and I experienced it myself, if you if you

08:25.320 --> 08:30.120
are transitioning from one because I used to be a musician and then I found it hard

08:30.120 --> 08:31.640
to make a living.

08:31.640 --> 08:38.680
I got married and had a kid and so it was it was hard and I couldn't financially sustain

08:38.680 --> 08:39.680
us.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.000
I mean, thankfully, I had had parents that could help us.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.400
But you know, as as a twenty one, twenty two year old, you don't want your daddy to look

08:46.400 --> 08:47.400
off to you.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.400
You want be independent.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.400
Right.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
You're like her.

08:50.400 --> 08:55.600
So so I had to find some way of making money.

08:55.600 --> 09:04.720
And at that time, flash was still a big thing, and that was my like gateway drug into this

09:04.720 --> 09:07.360
because it allowed me to combine different things.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.360
Right.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.120
It allowed me because I was I was like, oh, I can do animation with this thing.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
That's cool.

09:12.120 --> 09:17.840
And I can use music because back in the day, like in the early 2000s, like 2000, 2001,

09:17.840 --> 09:22.760
it was pretty popular to have this little like fancy intro with animation and music

09:22.760 --> 09:27.320
and like stuff, and then you add a button there again to enter the website.

09:27.320 --> 09:31.760
So I ended up building quite a few of those like intros for clients.

09:31.760 --> 09:37.760
So that that allowed me to give creative expression to myself and still have this little connection

09:37.760 --> 09:44.900
to my musical career, but also start like getting into the texting.

09:44.900 --> 09:53.560
And so but with that said, it was still hard because even when I was freelancing, how do

09:53.560 --> 09:55.440
you get a client if you have no work to show?

09:55.440 --> 09:56.440
Right.

09:56.440 --> 10:02.160
So now you have to like try and create these like pseudo projects that don't really exist.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.160
It's not for anybody.

10:03.160 --> 10:12.240
You have to somehow get yourself inspired to do this thing, just to say that, oh, here's

10:12.240 --> 10:18.560
the thing I bought, it's not really for anybody, but you can kind of see my skills, right?

10:18.560 --> 10:22.760
But it's me by myself alone and get up in these things that didn't even exist back then.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.360
So it's like literally me putting it on a URL and pointing it to it.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.360
So it was hard.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.360
It was really tough.

10:29.360 --> 10:37.160
And then again, I realized that maybe freelancing isn't going to work.

10:37.160 --> 10:44.320
I struggled to build my business to a point where I felt like we as a family will be financially

10:44.320 --> 10:48.480
stable and so I decided to join the workforce.

10:48.480 --> 10:52.800
And that was tough because I've been doing it for like two, three years at that point,

10:52.800 --> 10:57.400
but I had very little experience to show for that because a lot of the things I did was

10:57.400 --> 11:05.000
literally make things for myself as a means of having like designing logos for fictitious

11:05.000 --> 11:08.360
companies and stuff like that.

11:08.360 --> 11:13.160
And so that's one of the things that I want to do as part of the Mycelium network is to

11:13.160 --> 11:17.240
anything that we do, like for example, the Mycelium network needs a website, right?

11:17.240 --> 11:20.160
So I want to do that with the community.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.520
I don't want to go and build it.

11:21.520 --> 11:26.480
I want to do it with the community and I want to do it like a for real project.

11:26.480 --> 11:31.240
You know, we have a project board on GitHub, we have tasks, people get assigned to tasks,

11:31.240 --> 11:36.200
people need to do full request reviews, people need to read each other's code, all that kind

11:36.200 --> 11:37.200
of stuff.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.080
And be involved in how do we take that thing and get it live on the internet.

11:41.080 --> 11:47.840
Because the awesome thing about GitHub is it's open and so you can point any potential

11:47.840 --> 11:50.600
employer to the work you've done.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.700
And the nice thing if you do it in this like, so it's great to contribute to open source

11:54.700 --> 11:55.700
in general.

11:55.700 --> 11:59.280
I think it's a good way to get experience in that kind of thing.

11:59.280 --> 12:04.080
But if you're involved in something that's run as a structured project, you also show

12:04.080 --> 12:08.880
the employer that you can work as part of a team.

12:08.880 --> 12:15.320
You can take criticism, deal with it, not give up, maybe push back even if you feel

12:15.320 --> 12:19.880
strongly about it and come to a consensus and land your work.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.520
I think that is a really good way.

12:21.520 --> 12:26.040
So I think the thing that you mentioned about high tech you and how you looked at specifically

12:26.040 --> 12:30.680
problem solving, I think that's key and I think it's a key thing that's missing.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.800
So I'm curious, what do you think about all of that?

12:33.800 --> 12:39.660
How did you address this whole thing of creating problems for people to solve, to have a means

12:39.660 --> 12:43.840
of signaling to employers what they're capable of?

12:43.840 --> 12:45.340
Absolutely.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.340
And you're totally right.

12:46.340 --> 12:50.360
I mean, there's so many courses that you can do out there.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.780
And if you look on, it's interesting if you go on to GitHub and you look for projects

12:54.780 --> 12:55.960
a lot of the time, right?

12:55.960 --> 13:00.180
You'll find these half finished repos of like a project that somebody had to do as part

13:00.180 --> 13:02.460
of this course and there's no documentation.

13:02.460 --> 13:06.880
It's obviously something they did and it's almost discouraging.

13:06.880 --> 13:11.920
But there is such power in that world of GitHub and open source and I'm super excited to

13:11.920 --> 13:15.160
chat like open source and how that plays in.

13:15.160 --> 13:20.280
But for us, one of the big pieces and it ties into the creativity piece as well is we spent,

13:20.280 --> 13:27.320
so the kind of core program that we ran was like a five day long, I call it kind of an

13:27.320 --> 13:29.860
extended hackathon for beginners.

13:29.860 --> 13:33.740
So instead of sort of coming in and giving a problem statement or giving like a theme,

13:33.740 --> 13:37.420
we would sort of have them come in and we would teach them the fundamentals that they

13:37.420 --> 13:40.860
needed to know and then just kind of put them out there in the world.

13:40.860 --> 13:45.100
And we brought in mentors from local technology companies who would basically just be there

13:45.100 --> 13:46.320
floating around.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.400
So whereas unlike that traditional hackathon that you go to where you might have that,

13:51.400 --> 13:54.840
but it's generally about tapping into the expertise that's in your team or in your

13:54.840 --> 13:56.360
friend group.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.160
This was the expectation that nobody was coming in with any knowledge and then the mentors

14:00.160 --> 14:05.220
were just kind of there and able to support when questions came up.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.440
But within the world of the problem solving and ensuring that this was something that's

14:08.440 --> 14:12.980
going to be valuable for the students, one of the big pieces of that onboarding process

14:12.980 --> 14:19.500
was actually having them gain an understanding of design thinking from like the very base

14:19.500 --> 14:25.100
level of going and finding a problem that is relevant to a user base.

14:25.100 --> 14:32.020
And the unique thing in that program was we had about 16 high school age students that

14:32.020 --> 14:36.460
were there from grade nine to 12 and we said, great, within this sort of like this captured

14:36.460 --> 14:41.960
user group, go talk to each other and see what problems you can find within this group

14:41.960 --> 14:44.100
of 16 youth.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.060
So you've got your target market is there.

14:46.060 --> 14:49.640
You're building something that solves a problem for young people.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.720
You're going to do the user research all within like this super fast like hour long

14:53.720 --> 14:58.440
period and then we're going to work with you to identify the thing that you can actually

14:58.440 --> 15:07.580
accomplish with your skill level in this sort of like three days fundamentally of programming.

15:07.580 --> 15:12.140
And so that was a really powerful thing within this model of the projects that they were

15:12.140 --> 15:17.020
creating is every project that they were creating, they could speak to like why this is an issue

15:17.020 --> 15:18.860
because they're the user for it.

15:18.860 --> 15:23.460
And even if they're not the perfect user, the super user, the early adopter, they're

15:23.460 --> 15:27.180
going to get it because they're in that headspace.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.180
That's super clever.

15:28.180 --> 15:30.420
I really, I haven't thought about that angle.

15:30.420 --> 15:31.420
That's really nice.

15:31.420 --> 15:36.020
Like essentially telling your community, hey, instead of me bringing a project to you, you

15:36.020 --> 15:38.260
can bring a project to me by talking to each other.

15:38.260 --> 15:39.380
That's really clever.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.500
I really like that.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.500
That's a nice one.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.540
And okay, cool.

15:42.540 --> 15:46.060
So you've kind of like opened the door to open source and you said that you'd be really

15:46.060 --> 15:47.060
keen to talk about it.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.280
And it was one of my questions.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.580
So let's dive into it right now.

15:50.580 --> 15:54.220
Why do you, how do you see open source?

15:54.220 --> 15:58.780
What role does it play in teaching and learning?

15:58.780 --> 16:01.260
So from both sides and it's a big topic.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.260
Oh my goodness.

16:02.260 --> 16:03.260
Yeah.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.980
I love big topic though.

16:04.980 --> 16:05.980
This is good.

16:05.980 --> 16:07.060
It has three directions.

16:07.060 --> 16:13.060
So I mean, in terms of, I mean, I can talk about my experience using it within sort of

16:13.060 --> 16:18.660
teaching environments and then also just personally, cause I'm, I'm sort of learning this web development

16:18.660 --> 16:19.660
experience.

16:19.660 --> 16:24.420
So, so from the teaching perspective, one of the really great things that I've found

16:24.420 --> 16:36.700
is the open source world has really invited new developers to get a deeper understanding

16:36.700 --> 16:42.540
of the technology that's out there and that they're using every day.

16:42.540 --> 16:47.260
Whereas in the past, again, very similar to this project idea, if you wanted to see what

16:47.260 --> 16:51.620
code looked like for a project, you would have to go and find somebody that had published

16:51.620 --> 16:57.060
on their personal website or on some other service, some fairly boring project that was

16:57.060 --> 17:02.580
maybe in a language that you weren't interested in to now the world where literally you're

17:02.580 --> 17:06.540
excited about, maybe you're excited about live streaming and you want to, you want to

17:06.540 --> 17:08.660
see like the code behind Twitch.

17:08.660 --> 17:12.260
Now not all of it is going to be exposed, but you can go and take a look and sort of

17:12.260 --> 17:15.820
see like, Hey, this is the stuff that's underlying this technology.

17:15.820 --> 17:21.020
So I think there's a level of playing to people's interests and allowing them to get

17:21.020 --> 17:26.620
exposed to programming through exploring areas and topics that they're passionate about.

17:26.620 --> 17:29.980
I mean, I teach, so I teach at a middle school level.

17:29.980 --> 17:34.740
So I deal with learners that are doing things on sort of Minecraft and mind test a lot.

17:34.740 --> 17:38.420
That's a big thing with the age group that I work with and the mod community in there

17:38.420 --> 17:40.340
is huge.

17:40.340 --> 17:44.380
And the cool thing is I have kids learning about open source without ever knowing the

17:44.380 --> 17:45.860
word open source.

17:45.860 --> 17:49.120
They go and search Minecraft mod that does this thing.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.380
They end up on GitHub.

17:50.380 --> 17:55.460
They pull the code down, they're reviewing it and just based on their interest level,

17:55.460 --> 17:58.420
they're going in and they're discovering sort of open source.

17:58.420 --> 18:04.580
And that's opening the door to saying like, this isn't this ethereal thing that I can't

18:04.580 --> 18:07.420
understand or I'll never be able to wrap my mind around.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.080
They're actually letting me in the door.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.820
So I think accessibility is huge there.

18:12.820 --> 18:18.340
I think for me personally, as a learner who's been going through the development process,

18:18.340 --> 18:22.460
what I love is I've always been the kind of person that if I did a course, like where

18:22.460 --> 18:26.780
I'm building something, I'm going to get to step three of seven and I'm going to be out.

18:26.780 --> 18:27.780
I'm going to be done.

18:27.780 --> 18:31.340
I'm like, ah, this isn't something that I'm really interested in.

18:31.340 --> 18:35.100
What I love doing and what I found really powerful about open source is actually being

18:35.100 --> 18:39.860
able to just go and grab somebody's code and then mess around with it.

18:39.860 --> 18:44.220
Like have a working piece of code and then to go in there and I'm going to change a

18:44.220 --> 18:49.140
variable or like alter a method and I'm going to see the issue and the change that that

18:49.140 --> 18:50.860
does in there.

18:50.860 --> 18:55.220
And that's like, it's been a super powerful part of my learning journey is having this

18:55.220 --> 19:00.020
massive resource to go and dig into code like that.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.020
Yeah.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.020
Yeah.

19:02.020 --> 19:03.020
For sure.

19:03.020 --> 19:10.500
I was just about to ask you, like, I wonder how effective it is to, for example, present

19:10.500 --> 19:14.380
and while this is not somebody that's beginning, beginning, but somebody that's like had a

19:14.380 --> 19:20.820
little bit of learning of HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to create like a super simple

19:20.820 --> 19:21.820
project, right?

19:21.820 --> 19:26.260
It's like, say for example, a mobile navigation, right?

19:26.260 --> 19:27.540
So it has a little hamburger menu.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.140
When you click it, it opens a thing.

19:29.140 --> 19:30.860
When you click it again, it closes it.

19:30.860 --> 19:36.780
And so it does a couple of things, you know, it like it acts, it reacts to the user.

19:36.780 --> 19:41.220
It changes the icon based on the state of the menu.

19:41.220 --> 19:46.700
And then to tell students, okay, here's the code that makes that happen.

19:46.700 --> 19:57.020
Can you look at it, read through the code and write a blog post explaining how it works?

19:57.020 --> 20:02.380
I've often thought if that would be an interesting approach for learners.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.300
100% and at every level.

20:05.300 --> 20:08.820
So for the high tech U program, we built out the Academy.

20:08.820 --> 20:12.620
That's exactly kind of what we did, not the blog post angle, but we would actually give

20:12.620 --> 20:18.500
them a template that was a functional template, but it was the most basic template, right?

20:18.500 --> 20:23.220
So in our first iteration, they were doing really simple web apps built on, I think Node

20:23.220 --> 20:24.220
or something like that.

20:24.220 --> 20:27.900
And it was just, it would basically spit out a thing that said, hello world.

20:27.900 --> 20:31.100
The most recent iteration, we did the same thing with the GitHub template, but it was

20:31.100 --> 20:34.820
a discord bot and you would sort of follow the steps and it would give it.

20:34.820 --> 20:38.900
But again, it was not the build part one, two, three, and eventually you'll get to

20:38.900 --> 20:40.340
a bot from day one.

20:40.340 --> 20:46.100
You had a functional thing and your role was to customize it, which was huge.

20:46.100 --> 20:49.660
And that kind of carries through even to the work that I do with Battlesnake.

20:49.660 --> 20:56.060
And so within that, it's a very open source company, very community focused, but because

20:56.060 --> 21:04.520
of the nature of what it is, the game itself requires you to build your own web server

21:04.520 --> 21:05.780
in a different language.

21:05.780 --> 21:11.420
And so we provide templates that are really dumb, dumb snakes that are competing in this

21:11.420 --> 21:14.460
game that will not die.

21:14.460 --> 21:20.260
They will do a thing, but it's not going to be super powerful.

21:20.260 --> 21:24.060
And what's interesting there as well, that's I think even more unique about what we're

21:24.060 --> 21:30.020
doing with that company is that let's say somebody is using a template and say Python

21:30.020 --> 21:32.580
and they've learned how the Python template works.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.700
And we've got a Go template or a Rust template.

21:34.700 --> 21:38.380
They can then go and say like, okay, I see how it was laid out in Python.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.820
I'm going to go over to Rust and see how it's laid out there.

21:40.820 --> 21:45.620
And you're going to gain this really practical understanding just by looking at those different

21:45.620 --> 21:48.300
templates that are accomplishing the same thing.

21:48.300 --> 21:53.620
And yeah, I think that the whole world, when GitHub did templates, they shifted the game

21:53.620 --> 21:56.460
in such a huge way for education.

21:56.460 --> 21:57.580
That is for sure.

21:57.580 --> 22:00.860
I've totally embraced that.

22:00.860 --> 22:06.700
I've got this project called Project Calavera and it's very intentionally titled that way

22:06.700 --> 22:10.240
because it's all about creating skeletons.

22:10.240 --> 22:18.780
And some of them are the main one, the Project Calavera, Project Calavera is a CLI that basically

22:18.780 --> 22:22.860
if you're starting a new project and so you want to add prettier, you want to add some

22:22.860 --> 22:27.060
ESLent rules, you want to add style and rules, maybe you're using SAS, so you want to add

22:27.060 --> 22:28.840
some SAS stuff.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.700
That's kind of cumbersome, right?

22:30.700 --> 22:35.980
Either after you create a template that you then every time fork or not fork, when you

22:35.980 --> 22:40.100
create a new repo, you create it from that template, or you need to copy and paste stuff

22:40.100 --> 22:44.500
from this GitHub repository you keep around with all your default configs.

22:44.500 --> 22:48.900
So the way this one works is you basically run a CLI command and then you have some configuration

22:48.900 --> 22:50.740
in your package JSON.

22:50.740 --> 22:55.900
And based on that, it'll just spit out all that stuff for you.

22:55.900 --> 23:02.600
And I take community input and I follow a bunch of projects that create these best practices

23:02.600 --> 23:09.260
for what is the latest, greatest way to configure your ESLent or your style and how to configure

23:09.260 --> 23:10.980
battle and stuff like that.

23:10.980 --> 23:16.700
So it doesn't do framework things because that's why it says it's like a boilerplate

23:16.700 --> 23:22.100
for new projects, bring your own framework, because I think frameworks oftentimes have

23:22.100 --> 23:24.060
this built into their own little CLI.

23:24.060 --> 23:28.300
So if you start up a new Vue project or you start up a new React project with one of these

23:28.300 --> 23:34.180
like boilerplate things like create React app or the Vue CLI, it does that.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.020
But there isn't something like that for somebody that's just like, oh, but I don't want to

23:37.020 --> 23:38.020
use any framework.

23:38.020 --> 23:42.820
I really, my needs are pretty simple, but I would like the linting and all that stuff

23:42.820 --> 23:43.820
there.

23:43.820 --> 23:49.420
But then the other side that the Project Calaverno project also contains are exactly these things.

23:49.420 --> 23:54.340
So it's a basic template of a simple express server.

23:54.340 --> 23:57.900
And so if you just want to create an express server, but you don't want to go and set up

23:57.900 --> 24:03.300
the app.js and the default basic routes that you'll probably need and helmet to configure

24:03.300 --> 24:10.460
security, you could just use the Calavera template and start your project from there.

24:10.460 --> 24:15.060
And so you kind of can get the ground running and can get going quicker.

24:15.060 --> 24:20.420
But at the same time, it introduces you to existing code.

24:20.420 --> 24:23.540
So you might say like, oh, this is cool.

24:23.540 --> 24:26.000
What's all these things that I just gave me?

24:26.000 --> 24:29.300
And so I work hard on documenting like, this is what it does.

24:29.300 --> 24:30.300
These are the things that brings in.

24:30.300 --> 24:35.940
This is what each of these individual dependencies do for you.

24:35.940 --> 24:38.660
But then people can go back and say, oh, you know what?

24:38.660 --> 24:43.540
Actually this thing, I don't even think it should be part of the template or I think

24:43.540 --> 24:47.780
this template is missing something or hey, I think you've got behind a little bit.

24:47.780 --> 24:51.940
I'm quite good at express and we can improve it this way.

24:51.940 --> 24:56.300
Or for new people, it's just, you can read through the code and say, oh, that is how

24:56.300 --> 25:03.180
when I enter localhost 3000, it's serving the index pages because I have this get route

25:03.180 --> 25:05.020
in this routes.js file.

25:05.020 --> 25:06.020
Ah, gotcha.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.700
Now I get it.

25:07.700 --> 25:13.660
So yeah, I think that template thing you talked about is definitely, definitely key.

25:13.660 --> 25:15.020
Absolutely.

25:15.020 --> 25:19.740
And I think the other thing that you brought up that's super key about why open source

25:19.740 --> 25:24.360
and maybe this is an open source since it really became a much larger thing in sort

25:24.360 --> 25:26.140
of the 2000s.

25:26.140 --> 25:32.400
But this idea of documentation, even like, even if you go through and do one of these

25:32.400 --> 25:36.840
online courses where it's telling you the thing and you do it, once you get the final

25:36.840 --> 25:41.020
project, generally it's not including like inline comments, right?

25:41.020 --> 25:44.620
Where you're actually like commenting on a method or commenting on a variable to say

25:44.620 --> 25:46.340
what this thing is for.

25:46.340 --> 25:51.260
I think as soon as you open up your code to the world, it's forced individuals that are

25:51.260 --> 25:56.700
either contributing or creating to do a much better job at documenting, same with companies.

25:56.700 --> 26:03.300
And that's such a powerful thing for educational situations, learning situations is to be able

26:03.300 --> 26:08.340
to go in and almost see line by line and it doesn't fit in every situation.

26:08.340 --> 26:15.500
But for so many people to be able to reference back there on a regular basis is such a huge,

26:15.500 --> 26:17.060
a huge piece.

26:17.060 --> 26:22.460
And I certainly know like the framework that I, so I had programmed in PHP many years ago

26:22.460 --> 26:25.820
and then heard it was terrible and moved away and then decided that I was going to build

26:25.820 --> 26:27.100
a project in it.

26:27.100 --> 26:37.180
But the framework that I chose, I chose specifically because the creator of it has incredible focus

26:37.180 --> 26:38.420
on documentation for it.

26:38.420 --> 26:43.740
So not only are the docs good, but like you can go into a controller, it's an MVC model.

26:43.740 --> 26:46.980
So it's like, you can go into the controller, you can go into like new view and they're

26:46.980 --> 26:48.900
all documented just incredibly well.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.940
So you don't need to guess about things.

26:50.940 --> 26:51.940
It's all provided for you.

26:51.940 --> 26:57.500
Yeah, I know for sure, I think Nuxt is the view version.

26:57.500 --> 27:04.260
I think Next is the react version, but either way, they let it say it's Nuxt.

27:04.260 --> 27:09.780
Like it's so very well-documented because it generates a bunch of boilerplates for you,

27:09.780 --> 27:10.780
right?

27:10.780 --> 27:12.940
So it generates like folders and inside the folders and stuff.

27:12.940 --> 27:17.780
And as you open each folder, there's a read me inside every folder that tells you what

27:17.780 --> 27:21.640
the purpose of this folder and what's the purpose of the files in this folder.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.860
So there's no guesswork here.

27:23.860 --> 27:26.580
It's like, oh, I see.

27:26.580 --> 27:27.580
That's what it is.

27:27.580 --> 27:31.300
And it will, for example, say like, oh, there isn't, you will say, but wait a minute, there

27:31.300 --> 27:35.420
isn't a store directory.

27:35.420 --> 27:39.620
And then you'll see there's a read me where you would expect there to be store dot read

27:39.620 --> 27:40.620
me.

27:40.620 --> 27:42.420
And you're like, open that.

27:42.420 --> 27:47.540
The reason there isn't a store is because Nuxt, this is the way the configuration works

27:47.540 --> 27:49.780
and it generates the store for you.

27:49.780 --> 27:53.360
So you never have to worry about the store and that is why it doesn't exist.

27:53.360 --> 27:56.220
I'm really impressed with their documentation.

27:56.220 --> 28:02.380
And I think the other side of documentation is opening it up to community for localization.

28:02.380 --> 28:09.300
I think I saw a documentary about Vue.js and the creator, Evan Yu.

28:09.300 --> 28:15.580
And one of the reasons Vue took off in China so much as opposed to React was literally

28:15.580 --> 28:20.860
because Evan is originally Chinese, he lives in the US.

28:20.860 --> 28:25.940
But for him, it was important to have the docs available in Chinese from the beginning.

28:25.940 --> 28:30.660
And so he opened it up to the community and he did some of the translation himself.

28:30.660 --> 28:34.980
And that is the main reason why Vue 1 overreact when it comes to China.

28:34.980 --> 28:39.160
Because for the people in China, it was very important to have it available in their language.

28:39.160 --> 28:44.180
And so that being there from the get go, over and above the fact that it was really good

28:44.180 --> 28:48.380
documentation, the fact that it was available in their language made a big difference.

28:48.380 --> 28:54.140
And the more I am involved in communities like Mercedes Network and other larger communities

28:54.140 --> 29:02.220
I'm also involved with, I have gained an understanding and a respect for a lot of people that really

29:02.220 --> 29:04.840
love their native language.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.580
And for them, it's not like I can't speak English.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.500
It is really like they have a passion for their language.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.700
They have a passion for their culture.

29:12.700 --> 29:18.820
And it's important to them to be able to read the content in their language.

29:18.820 --> 29:21.740
And we often forget that.

29:21.740 --> 29:22.740
It's in English.

29:22.740 --> 29:23.740
Everybody can speak English, right?

29:23.740 --> 29:24.740
Yeah.

29:24.740 --> 29:25.740
It's not just about that.

29:25.740 --> 29:26.740
There's more to it.

29:26.740 --> 29:27.740
There's more subtleties about it.

29:27.740 --> 29:31.300
So I think it's important to encourage that when you run projects.

29:31.300 --> 29:32.940
Absolutely.

29:32.940 --> 29:34.220
I couldn't agree more.

29:34.220 --> 29:42.060
I think we, yeah, it's the simple things that certainly as a native English speaker,

29:42.060 --> 29:48.180
I love going into these frameworks and these tools and looking at this code and finding

29:48.180 --> 29:50.020
it in my native language.

29:50.020 --> 29:59.220
And yeah, I think there's been a really big, maybe not resurgence, or I think a big push

29:59.220 --> 30:09.060
around the world with it really focusing more on making accessibility, not just about can

30:09.060 --> 30:13.900
people use this, but also can people use it in a way that they feel the most safe and

30:13.900 --> 30:14.900
comfortable.

30:14.900 --> 30:15.900
Exactly.

30:15.900 --> 30:16.900
Exactly.

30:16.900 --> 30:19.900
I think the term accessibility is getting a lot of attention and I'm really, really happy

30:19.900 --> 30:23.300
about that because that's one of the things that I'm really passionate about.

30:23.300 --> 30:27.140
But I think people have also understood that the umbrella that's covered by accessibility

30:27.140 --> 30:32.100
is much larger than what people have thought about in the past.

30:32.100 --> 30:34.500
But I am super curious about Battlesnake.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.020
And the more you talk about it, the more curious I get.

30:37.020 --> 30:40.940
So I'm going to like, please tell us more about Battlesnake.

30:40.940 --> 30:41.940
Awesome.

30:41.940 --> 30:42.940
Yeah.

30:42.940 --> 30:53.100
So Battlesnake is a multiplayer programming game where your code is the controller and

30:53.100 --> 30:59.740
you are building, basically, fundamentally, you're building a web server to compete in

30:59.740 --> 31:02.580
the classic sort of Nokia phone game Snake.

31:02.580 --> 31:05.500
Did you ever play that where you sort of the snake goes up and you try and eat and you

31:05.500 --> 31:07.780
get longer and you try not to die?

31:07.780 --> 31:08.780
Yep.

31:08.780 --> 31:09.780
Yep.

31:09.780 --> 31:10.780
Yeah, I played that a lot.

31:10.780 --> 31:11.780
Yeah.

31:11.780 --> 31:12.780
So it's that.

31:12.780 --> 31:18.580
But it's now a programming game where folks build out, I guess, at a core level, they're

31:18.580 --> 31:25.980
building out an AI snake that's going to compete against other AI snakes to try and win and

31:25.980 --> 31:30.660
survive and win prizes or win points or win bragging rights or whatever you're looking

31:30.660 --> 31:33.900
to get out of the platform.

31:33.900 --> 31:43.020
And so it started out, I think, in the early aughts of the 2000s as a sort of a recruiting

31:43.020 --> 31:44.020
event.

31:44.020 --> 31:48.980
So it was run by a startup here in Victoria, and they would invite hundreds and what eventually

31:48.980 --> 31:54.380
became thousands of developers to come in and basically do a hackathon, but all focused

31:54.380 --> 32:00.300
on one specific problem, which was, can you build a snake that can beat the other snakes?

32:00.300 --> 32:05.580
And it's since transformed into a global platform, more than 10,000 developers around the world

32:05.580 --> 32:14.220
are playing this game right now and really has shifted from a focus on recruiting to

32:14.220 --> 32:20.500
providing a really cool sandbox for professional developers to explore new technologies in

32:20.500 --> 32:25.780
a way that isn't having them just sort of build out a project that's kind of boring.

32:25.780 --> 32:28.820
Yeah, that's super cool.

32:28.820 --> 32:32.860
I wonder, I've been seeing like these, I haven't checked on them yet.

32:32.860 --> 32:38.300
I don't know why, but anyway, I've been seeing videos pop up in my YouTube recommendations

32:38.300 --> 32:43.580
that's around the Nokia snake thing, and now I'm starting to wonder, is this Battlesnake

32:43.580 --> 32:44.580
related?

32:44.580 --> 32:49.300
So I'm definitely going to click on one of those just after this chat and see if it's

32:49.300 --> 32:50.300
all about this.

32:50.300 --> 32:53.420
But I'm also going to look at Battlesnake and try and give it a go.

32:53.420 --> 32:58.140
So can you kind of create like a little community and say like, we're going to build the Mycelium

32:58.140 --> 33:01.220
network snake and see if it can like beat stuff?

33:01.220 --> 33:03.060
Yeah, so this is the cool thing.

33:03.060 --> 33:07.580
So this is a feature that's like very sort of early days.

33:07.580 --> 33:10.820
It's kind of, we've gone through many iterations, but yeah, so we're in the process of building

33:10.820 --> 33:14.860
out features where you would have a team and it would basically be, you would sign up for

33:14.860 --> 33:20.060
the Mycelium network team and then your snake would be represented as the Mycelium network

33:20.060 --> 33:21.060
there.

33:21.060 --> 33:24.880
But already, I think we just launched the feature really recently where you can run

33:24.880 --> 33:29.640
sort of a Mycelium network tournament where people will build their own snakes and go

33:29.640 --> 33:34.820
and build them and then you'll run sort of a small competition and it auto generates

33:34.820 --> 33:36.700
the brackets and the ladders.

33:36.700 --> 33:41.060
And so basically you just press a button that says play and it'll have these big, the games

33:41.060 --> 33:44.900
will show up and it's super exciting to watch.

33:44.900 --> 33:54.380
It's one of these situations that is as close to sort of a sporting event for competitive

33:54.380 --> 33:58.300
programming or for collaborative programming as you can possibly get.

33:58.300 --> 34:04.100
And it's good if you got to – our CEO, our co-founder has young kids and they love

34:04.100 --> 34:05.780
tuning in anytime we have a tournament.

34:05.780 --> 34:09.920
Because it's just bright colors and fun designs that are going around on the stage

34:09.920 --> 34:11.880
or around the screen.

34:11.880 --> 34:15.020
But they love it and they're cheering for their favorite snake and hoping that they

34:15.020 --> 34:16.020
win.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.020
And yeah, it's pretty amazing.

34:17.020 --> 34:20.420
That was very much like BattleBots, right?

34:20.420 --> 34:21.420
Exactly.

34:21.420 --> 34:25.940
I love watching that, where people like build these bots and then they try and destroy the

34:25.940 --> 34:26.940
other bot.

34:26.940 --> 34:27.940
Exactly, yeah.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.140
It's such a nerdy thing, but it's so fun.

34:30.140 --> 34:31.140
Totally.

34:31.140 --> 34:32.140
And that's just it.

34:32.140 --> 34:33.140
It is.

34:33.140 --> 34:36.460
And now, that was always for, right, you had to be an electrical engineer or mechanical

34:36.460 --> 34:38.620
engineer to build those bots.

34:38.620 --> 34:43.220
Now it's like you can be a software developer with a year of experience or one that has

34:43.220 --> 34:47.400
10 years of experience, and you can go and build this really cool thing that teaches

34:47.400 --> 34:55.060
you a new language or a new technology stack and really do it in a way that you're not

34:55.060 --> 34:59.580
just building a project that's going to sit in a repository somewhere and that nobody's

34:59.580 --> 35:00.780
going to care about.

35:00.780 --> 35:05.620
You're invested in this code that you've created in a way that it's personified.

35:05.620 --> 35:11.300
You can add custom skins to it, so you can have heads and tails that are from a big list

35:11.300 --> 35:15.060
of customizations, and you can get points to get more of them.

35:15.060 --> 35:17.260
Yeah, it's just so exciting.

35:17.260 --> 35:22.620
One of the big reasons that that has been super successful is A, open source.

35:22.620 --> 35:26.600
Almost all of the platform, all of the key components of it are open source.

35:26.600 --> 35:32.340
We have folks contributing to it all the time, but also community has been a massive, massive

35:32.340 --> 35:37.620
part of its success of just enabling the community to get in there and get their hands dirty

35:37.620 --> 35:38.620
with code.

35:38.620 --> 35:39.620
That's awesome.

35:39.620 --> 35:42.460
Yeah, I was about to ask about the open source thing, because I remember you mentioned that,

35:42.460 --> 35:44.060
and I was like, oh, wow.

35:44.060 --> 35:49.940
I guess there's quite a lot of opportunity for folks to also contribute directly to the

35:49.940 --> 35:50.940
project.

35:50.940 --> 35:51.940
Yeah.

35:51.940 --> 35:56.540
I mean, it's even gotten to the point where... We've had open source, and it's tying

35:56.540 --> 35:58.420
this back to the documentation piece.

35:58.420 --> 36:06.380
We've had a documentation repository forever that was really only managed by our team.

36:06.380 --> 36:09.540
We really always wanted community members to join, but then we had a bunch of community

36:09.540 --> 36:13.200
members that were like, I'd really like to see this in there, but I don't want to contribute

36:13.200 --> 36:18.060
to the official documentation, so they created a separate documentation that we provided

36:18.060 --> 36:23.820
support for, and now that's become our official documentation setup.

36:23.820 --> 36:26.940
It's a community-led project that we were like, yes, this is the thing that we really

36:26.940 --> 36:29.540
want to adopt.

36:29.540 --> 36:36.100
That's at this core level now, this code that is such a core piece of what we do is something

36:36.100 --> 36:38.660
that our community said, we can do it better.

36:38.660 --> 36:39.660
Yeah.

36:39.660 --> 36:40.660
Yeah.

36:40.660 --> 36:42.780
I mean, that is where diversity comes in, right?

36:42.780 --> 36:48.220
Often times, if you open it up to the world and say, poke at our stuff and tell us if

36:48.220 --> 36:52.460
you can think of better ways of doing it, more often than not, it does happen.

36:52.460 --> 36:57.700
I love the fact that the company was willing to embrace this, because so often, people

36:57.700 --> 37:01.660
are very precious about the things they make, if you know what I mean, and so they're like,

37:01.660 --> 37:02.660
no, no, no, no, no.

37:02.660 --> 37:08.380
They could not possibly be better than what we did, so kudos to the company for adopting

37:08.380 --> 37:09.380
this.

37:09.380 --> 37:10.380
I think it's amazing.

37:10.380 --> 37:15.020
I've had a little poke at your website and LinkedIn and stuff like that, and I'm curious

37:15.020 --> 37:16.180
about this one thing.

37:16.180 --> 37:25.300
You've written scholarly documents on quantum computing.

37:25.300 --> 37:27.260
Do you want to tell us about some of those?

37:27.260 --> 37:29.540
You have linked to these citations.

37:29.540 --> 37:34.660
I had a friend that worked at a quantum computing company for a little bit.

37:34.660 --> 37:38.380
I've listened to the WIRED thing, where they explain it to me like I'm five.

37:38.380 --> 37:40.900
I've listened to that, it's fascinating.

37:40.900 --> 37:45.060
I still don't think I quite understand it, but I would love to hear your take on it.

37:45.060 --> 37:46.060
Absolutely.

37:46.060 --> 37:53.780
Yeah, so when I was working with the team that built out the HITECH-U program at the

37:53.780 --> 38:00.220
University of Victoria, one of the co-founders and a huge mentor to me, Ulrika Staiga, she

38:00.220 --> 38:05.020
was the chair of the computer science department at the University of Victoria at the time,

38:05.020 --> 38:11.260
and her and her husband actually, who's also a professor at the University in Software

38:11.260 --> 38:19.300
Engineering, have been the quintessential leaders in the space of quantum computing

38:19.300 --> 38:23.380
education at the University of Victoria and actually arguably in British Columbia and

38:23.380 --> 38:25.660
Canada and North America.

38:25.660 --> 38:29.800
One of the key pieces when they were building out that sort of what quantum computing education

38:29.800 --> 38:34.940
looks like, which was at a focus on the post-secondary level, was we want to make this accessible

38:34.940 --> 38:40.580
for everybody because it's too late if they're in their postdocs to be learning about quantum

38:40.580 --> 38:41.700
computing.

38:41.700 --> 38:45.220
This is like a hugely up-and-coming field.

38:45.220 --> 38:51.260
So yeah, so the initial iteration was we create a play on words, so we did instead of HITECH-U,

38:51.260 --> 39:01.060
we called it HITECH-Q, and really focus just on how can we take the core components of

39:01.060 --> 39:07.180
quantum computing and make it accessible to a high school student.

39:07.180 --> 39:16.260
And so the first year that we ran the workshop, we had some partners from IBM, and we were

39:16.260 --> 39:22.500
able to get access to IBM's quantum computing, their actual quantum computer as well as their

39:22.500 --> 39:28.660
simulation software, and gave learners this run through.

39:28.660 --> 39:32.940
And what's really cool is the focus there was actually to build out a curriculum that

39:32.940 --> 39:38.100
again was open source for people to use, where we were testing the waters to see what this

39:38.100 --> 39:42.360
looked like at the high school level, and then we published a few papers to then say

39:42.360 --> 39:44.580
here's where you can go and do it yourself.

39:44.580 --> 39:45.580
Oh, brilliant.

39:45.580 --> 39:46.580
Yeah, that's great.

39:46.580 --> 39:52.420
I'll definitely close up, and I'm going to read them myself, that's for sure.

39:52.420 --> 39:56.660
Another thing that I found that you wrote on this Battlesnake blog actually is deploying

39:56.660 --> 39:58.940
web servers for free in 2022.

39:58.940 --> 40:04.620
I think this is a key piece that's often missing.

40:04.620 --> 40:09.100
A lot of people are like, okay, cool, I understand HTML and CSS, I think I'm starting to get

40:09.100 --> 40:15.940
my pictographs JavaScript, but how the heck do I get this on a website?

40:15.940 --> 40:20.700
It's cool, I get up, but I want my own URL and things, you want to talk about that a

40:20.700 --> 40:21.700
little bit?

40:21.700 --> 40:23.300
Oh yeah, absolutely.

40:23.300 --> 40:29.260
This is one of these interesting situations that I run into as the non-developer working

40:29.260 --> 40:35.220
for developers and doing things that newbies do.

40:35.220 --> 40:38.700
There's a really cool initiative that we run through Battlesnake called our Developer

40:38.700 --> 40:45.900
Fellowship, which is a program focused on providing support to women and non-binary

40:45.900 --> 40:50.780
developers from across Canada who just don't have access to either people or mentorship

40:50.780 --> 40:52.820
or resources.

40:52.820 --> 40:57.700
Remember that one of the big pieces, super cool initiative, we do it with a bank here

40:57.700 --> 41:03.520
in Canada called RBC who are just this spectacular partner for Battlesnake.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.100
One of the pieces of that was educational opportunities.

41:06.100 --> 41:09.580
I wanted to be able to go in with these developers that were joining and say, here's a bunch

41:09.580 --> 41:13.700
of ways that you can deploy a Battlesnake to learn a new technology.

41:13.700 --> 41:18.740
I spent a morning and I just went on all these platforms that I basically Googled, how can

41:18.740 --> 41:24.180
I do this really fast and for cheap, and then did a timing and then our CEO Brad was like,

41:24.180 --> 41:30.980
hey man, you need to do this as a legitimate blog post that you can share out more widely.

41:30.980 --> 41:37.660
That queued up a two month journey of me going and finding even more platforms and trying

41:37.660 --> 41:38.660
to build this out.

41:38.660 --> 41:42.820
It doesn't necessarily look that way in the final blog post, but we've got more.

41:42.820 --> 41:47.020
I deployed on about 12 different services and we were like, we're going to start with

41:47.020 --> 41:50.060
the five that we have here and then go from there.

41:50.060 --> 41:52.340
I don't know.

41:52.340 --> 41:58.500
I fully understand, I heard a famous quote once where a person said, it took me four

41:58.500 --> 42:02.340
hours to make a 10 minute video, so I totally understand.

42:02.340 --> 42:03.340
Absolutely.

42:03.340 --> 42:07.860
Yeah, and I mean the focus with this, for anybody that wants to read it, it's really

42:07.860 --> 42:11.460
cool if you go to blog.battlesnake.com, it's kind of linked on there.

42:11.460 --> 42:16.980
But basically my focus with this was for folks that are at my level or early stage developers

42:16.980 --> 42:22.460
that are not able to log into AWS and figure things out or they look at that and then they

42:22.460 --> 42:28.100
run away screaming, was to look and find accessible, and I know we're using that word a lot, but

42:28.100 --> 42:34.780
I mean accessible for the lay person or the new person to go in and within five minutes

42:34.780 --> 42:40.820
ideally get a functional web server out there from an open source GitHub template.

42:40.820 --> 42:47.780
And it's funny, so despite the fact that AWS and Azure and GCP kind of have the market

42:47.780 --> 42:53.460
share for like large companies that are doing it, there's a lot of these smaller companies

42:53.460 --> 42:58.380
that are coming out, especially now that Heroku has decided to remove their free plan in sort

42:58.380 --> 43:01.020
of September, October.

43:01.020 --> 43:04.580
There's more of these companies that are sort of releasing better free plans for people

43:04.580 --> 43:06.820
to get there.

43:06.820 --> 43:12.220
And so I got to do like massive shout out, there's a platform that is actually based

43:12.220 --> 43:16.940
here in Canada as well, actually here on the West Coast, that is I think fundamentally

43:16.940 --> 43:21.820
is a game changer in the open source deployment space called Railway.

43:21.820 --> 43:27.260
And it's the most beautiful and smoothest platform that I've ever used.

43:27.260 --> 43:33.180
They also include in their, when you're starting a new project with them, you can choose from

43:33.180 --> 43:38.300
a bunch of open source projects and when you click deploy, it goes through and reads everything,

43:38.300 --> 43:44.500
but it'll deploy the database, it'll deploy your server, it'll give you a public domain.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.780
It's all free for like 500 hours a month.

43:46.780 --> 43:48.980
So just like super, super cool.

43:48.980 --> 43:49.980
Wow.

43:49.980 --> 43:50.980
That is really impressive.

43:50.980 --> 43:52.900
Yeah, I'll definitely check that out.

43:52.900 --> 43:58.820
It's incredible the tooling that's becoming available, honestly, like the ability to just

43:58.820 --> 44:02.900
open your browser and like do everything.

44:02.900 --> 44:05.580
Like you don't have to even leave your browser.

44:05.580 --> 44:06.580
It's super amazing.

44:06.580 --> 44:13.540
I don't know if you know about the browser company, they make this browser called Arc.

44:13.540 --> 44:14.540
It's pretty new.

44:14.540 --> 44:21.460
It's pretty new and it's based on Chromium, but the experience is completely different.

44:21.460 --> 44:24.220
Like they're re-envisioning what a browser can be.

44:24.220 --> 44:27.320
And I actually had a talk from the CEO the other day about some of the dreams they have

44:27.320 --> 44:33.740
for Arc and he sees this is essentially this future where what he calls internet machines

44:33.740 --> 44:35.300
are going to become the thing.

44:35.300 --> 44:38.340
And it's very Chromebook-y in nature.

44:38.340 --> 44:45.520
It's this idea that Arc can be not just your browser, but it's your computer.

44:45.520 --> 44:51.340
Because if so many things that you think is application is actually just a web app that's

44:51.340 --> 44:56.300
running in Electron or something like that, where it's in the end of the day, it's actually

44:56.300 --> 44:59.260
just a browser.

44:59.260 --> 45:05.980
And so the idea is that Arc will open up those possibilities and make it like this thing

45:05.980 --> 45:08.380
that you just open up and you're like, okay, cool.

45:08.380 --> 45:10.620
Open up Arc and the rest of the day you're just marked.

45:10.620 --> 45:14.580
And like GitHub has done so much to do this, like getting around GitHub with their command

45:14.580 --> 45:15.580
palette.

45:15.580 --> 45:19.540
You just need command key on a Mac and it pops open and you're just like, okay, I want

45:19.540 --> 45:22.940
to go to this repo, boop, boop, I want to go to that one, command key.

45:22.940 --> 45:23.940
You don't even have to click.

45:23.940 --> 45:25.660
You can just use the keyboard to get around.

45:25.660 --> 45:28.900
You can move files, you can rename files.

45:28.900 --> 45:34.780
And then if you really want to do some intricate work, you just open a code space.

45:34.780 --> 45:39.340
Now you've got the entire VS code running in your browser with all it's synced with

45:39.340 --> 45:43.260
your local VS code so it brings in all your extensions and everything's there.

45:43.260 --> 45:46.500
And then you have services like Railway you talked about where you can just say, okay,

45:46.500 --> 45:51.900
cool, Railway, take all the stuff I just did and deploy it all, database and all.

45:51.900 --> 45:52.900
It's amazing.

45:52.900 --> 45:58.140
It is, and you know, there's another one similar to the code spaces.

45:58.140 --> 46:01.420
I don't know if you've heard of Gitpod, have you heard of them?

46:01.420 --> 46:02.420
I've heard about it.

46:02.420 --> 46:03.420
Yeah.

46:03.420 --> 46:04.420
Somebody mentioned it to me.

46:04.420 --> 46:05.420
I'm still alive.

46:05.420 --> 46:06.420
Look at that.

46:06.420 --> 46:07.420
Yeah.

46:07.420 --> 46:10.900
So it's the same idea as code spaces, but the entire platform, that's all they do is

46:10.900 --> 46:12.580
basically just do code spaces.

46:12.580 --> 46:22.100
But I've used both when I was setting up during that sort of blog post process, it literally

46:22.100 --> 46:29.060
like runs up a full, a full setup for you, including your in web browser in like, I don't

46:29.060 --> 46:30.860
know, it was like 20 seconds.

46:30.860 --> 46:33.720
It was ridiculously fast.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.620
And I was like, I don't know how you're doing this, especially when you're, this is free

46:36.620 --> 46:41.020
for a lot of the time, but also it's just so incredible.

46:41.020 --> 46:45.620
And it's funny because I've moved, I purchased a secondary device, it was a Chromebook and

46:45.620 --> 46:50.200
I've tried to set up local device or set up things on my local device and like use the

46:50.200 --> 46:53.420
backend sort of like Linux environment that it gives you.

46:53.420 --> 46:56.740
And yeah, I like, I ended up like, you run into so many issues that you're like, can

46:56.740 --> 46:58.620
I do this in the browser?

46:58.620 --> 47:00.580
And you can, and it's so much easier.

47:00.580 --> 47:04.100
You don't need to worry about where, where were your most recent commits if you didn't

47:04.100 --> 47:08.260
actually push it up to the, push it up to where you should have pushed it up at the

47:08.260 --> 47:09.700
time.

47:09.700 --> 47:11.940
It's just all there for you.

47:11.940 --> 47:17.180
And I think that's actually, that's a big, for new web developers, folks that are getting

47:17.180 --> 47:20.540
into the space, I think that's a game changer.

47:20.540 --> 47:27.700
This whole browser based setup, I have a, I have a colleague, I have a colleague that

47:27.700 --> 47:29.660
has been a software developer for years.

47:29.660 --> 47:34.340
And they, they said to me recently, you know, one of the biggest things that I do with folks

47:34.340 --> 47:40.060
that are getting involved in sort of a technology role, or they want to get in there is I will

47:40.060 --> 47:44.220
sit down with them for two to three hours and I will just like spend all that time to

47:44.220 --> 47:47.300
get them set up with the perfect development environment.

47:47.300 --> 47:50.900
Because if they have a terrible experience with getting their dev environment set up,

47:50.900 --> 47:52.740
they're going to walk away.

47:52.740 --> 47:59.740
And so making that process and getting rid of the, the, the, the barriers that exist

47:59.740 --> 48:02.500
there, I think is a huge game changer.

48:02.500 --> 48:03.500
Yeah.

48:03.500 --> 48:08.000
I'm finding with the people that I have in the community, I'm finding that people on

48:08.000 --> 48:12.140
windows machines are especially struggling with this.

48:12.140 --> 48:18.220
I mean, kudos to Microsoft for adding like windows subsystem for Linux and making that

48:18.220 --> 48:20.380
be more and more seamless.

48:20.380 --> 48:23.300
But even with that, it's still really hard.

48:23.300 --> 48:30.180
Like if you're not on a Mac or if you're not on Linux, Linux is still tricky, but much,

48:30.180 --> 48:32.500
much easier than windows.

48:32.500 --> 48:36.660
That's oftentimes what you end up doing most of your day is fighting with your tools.

48:36.660 --> 48:39.160
And that's the last thing you want to do.

48:39.160 --> 48:43.420
Even as a professional being in the industry for 10 years, 15 years, the last thing you

48:43.420 --> 48:45.620
want to do is wake up and fight with your tools.

48:45.620 --> 48:46.940
You want to solve problems.

48:46.940 --> 48:48.900
You want to be, you know, productive.

48:48.900 --> 48:52.420
You don't want to like, ah, I just can't do this thing because VS code is being weird

48:52.420 --> 48:57.060
or because for some reason, like MongoDB has just disappeared.

48:57.060 --> 49:00.480
Like suddenly I don't have MongoDB anymore.

49:00.480 --> 49:04.340
So I think these in browser things that also gives you this ability to create like these

49:04.340 --> 49:09.020
dev containers, like you can do in code spaces where basically you open it up and it's like,

49:09.020 --> 49:12.700
I'm just going to get everything ready for you because the creator of this code space

49:12.700 --> 49:14.820
has already told me what you will need.

49:14.820 --> 49:16.700
So I'm going to download all these extensions.

49:16.700 --> 49:20.860
I'm going to do all these configurations and you just open a file and start writing code.

49:20.860 --> 49:25.940
I think it's, it's definitely like you say, it's, it's a complete game changer.

49:25.940 --> 49:26.940
It's funny.

49:26.940 --> 49:30.660
So for the, for, for anybody that that's out there that is on windows, I'm a windows developer.

49:30.660 --> 49:31.660
I do it there.

49:31.660 --> 49:33.820
I struggled for years with this same thing.

49:33.820 --> 49:40.620
I found this brilliant piece of software, open source software again called Laragon.

49:40.620 --> 49:47.800
And so this is a kind of like a watered down or maybe not watered down based on my understanding

49:47.800 --> 49:52.260
of like a local Docker instance, but it's not that it's just an app that runs the web

49:52.260 --> 49:53.260
server.

49:53.260 --> 49:59.900
It's like a lamp or like WAMP, like those old, those old systems that you had set up,

49:59.900 --> 50:02.940
but but it's much more modern.

50:02.940 --> 50:08.660
You can, with the click of a button, you can install anything that you want to, even to

50:08.660 --> 50:14.140
the point of like publishing or, or getting your app up on ngrok, whereas normally you'd

50:14.140 --> 50:16.060
have to go through a bunch of steps in the command line.

50:16.060 --> 50:19.940
It's literally just like you right click on the app and then click deploy to the internet

50:19.940 --> 50:25.660
and then it'll just like spin up an ngrok URL for you that you're able to use.

50:25.660 --> 50:28.940
Just like it was a game changer for me when I discovered it.

50:28.940 --> 50:30.500
Oh, that's brilliant.

50:30.500 --> 50:34.300
Yeah, I'm definitely going to share that like with everybody.

50:34.300 --> 50:38.340
It almost feels like it's almost like, I don't know if you know set up, set up is this thing

50:38.340 --> 50:44.780
you get on, on Macs where you pay like $10 a month and then it's got all like these applications

50:44.780 --> 50:47.060
that solves all these little problems for you.

50:47.060 --> 50:51.140
It's often like indie developers and they've created like this little app that does this

50:51.140 --> 50:53.460
one thing really, really well.

50:53.460 --> 50:57.060
But there's also like big apps on there that you wouldn't even expect to be on there seeing

50:57.060 --> 51:01.740
that you only have $10 a month, but it almost feels like a set up, but for developers.

51:01.740 --> 51:05.260
And I think that would actually be super awesome if somebody can create something like that.

51:05.260 --> 51:11.180
That's cross platform where you literally say, well, I need a server that can run PHP.

51:11.180 --> 51:15.100
I need a MySQL database and I need a VS code thing and I need that.

51:15.100 --> 51:16.100
And it just goes cool.

51:16.100 --> 51:18.940
Here I go and there's everything for you.

51:18.940 --> 51:20.740
That would be amazing.

51:20.740 --> 51:23.660
So there's project ideas.

51:23.660 --> 51:24.660
I love that.

51:24.660 --> 51:25.660
Yeah, yeah.

51:25.660 --> 51:29.700
I mean, I totally feel the pain of all those Windows developers out there.

51:29.700 --> 51:35.860
And yeah, well, you're talking about having these, again, going back to the browser piece.

51:35.860 --> 51:42.100
Say what you want about folks that are not able to set up a local development environment

51:42.100 --> 51:48.420
and that may cause challenges for them later on in their career, but especially for early

51:48.420 --> 51:53.700
stage folks that are really just needing to get into the code and not fight and not know

51:53.700 --> 51:56.260
how to troubleshoot these things.

51:56.260 --> 52:02.340
I think there's going to be a big shift in certainly for junior devs especially.

52:02.340 --> 52:06.940
Yeah, I completely agree with that.

52:06.940 --> 52:10.100
So I want to cycle back into something different that's very, very different to what we've

52:10.100 --> 52:14.260
been talking about, but I think it's something to touch on.

52:14.260 --> 52:17.620
Seeing that you are kind of, and it's interesting because you're kind of like both sides of

52:17.620 --> 52:18.620
the coin.

52:18.620 --> 52:23.140
You've been involved with education, but you're also like a web developer still learning the

52:23.140 --> 52:28.980
craft and going through interviews and all that kind of good stuff.

52:28.980 --> 52:32.380
What are your thoughts around interviews, especially related to the tech industry?

52:32.380 --> 52:37.780
I think interviews are generally a challenging thing no matter what the industry, but I want

52:37.780 --> 52:40.140
us to kind of focus in on the tech industry.

52:40.140 --> 52:41.500
Do you have any thoughts around this topic?

52:41.500 --> 52:45.380
I know it's a bit of a hard topic, but anything you want to say?

52:45.380 --> 52:50.820
Yeah, so I mean, I guess I come to this from an interesting angle just because even the

52:50.820 --> 52:57.060
position that I have with Battlesnake, it wasn't necessarily an interview per se in

52:57.060 --> 52:58.660
the traditional way.

52:58.660 --> 53:04.100
So the interview that I actually had that kind of got me in there, and I think there's

53:04.100 --> 53:10.420
probably some piece of that that people can take away, was the work that I did with HiTechU.

53:10.420 --> 53:16.460
So the founder of Battlesnake, which is the company that I work for now, when we were

53:16.460 --> 53:19.900
first building up the program, we went and met with I think 30 different tech companies

53:19.900 --> 53:22.820
and said, hey, we've got this idea, what do you think about this?

53:22.820 --> 53:26.060
And it was generally just a fact-finding mission.

53:26.060 --> 53:29.780
And we went and met with this one company and they said, we love this idea, it's fantastic.

53:29.780 --> 53:32.260
How much money do you need to make it successful?

53:32.260 --> 53:37.620
And we threw out a number that was way too small and he said, add another zero and we'll

53:37.620 --> 53:39.520
make that happen.

53:39.520 --> 53:43.180
And so through that process, it was a lot of sort of them being really involved and

53:43.180 --> 53:47.520
seeing how I worked and the things that I was able to accomplish and to get an idea

53:47.520 --> 53:52.060
of who I was as sort of a worker and just a person.

53:52.060 --> 53:55.340
And then when the opportunity came that this position became open, it was sort of more

53:55.340 --> 53:57.060
of a conversation.

53:57.060 --> 54:02.100
So I think while this doesn't tie necessarily directly into the interview, one of the things

54:02.100 --> 54:07.860
that I will say is you never know where a job is going to come from, and you never know

54:07.860 --> 54:11.660
what is actually an interview that you don't realize.

54:11.660 --> 54:19.260
So anytime you're interacting with somebody in the technology industry, I would say from

54:19.260 --> 54:24.860
step one, from that cold email that you're sending them to the coffee that you're having

54:24.860 --> 54:28.300
with them, all of that is an interview process.

54:28.300 --> 54:33.060
And as somebody who has hired a lot of people that are in the technology space, I will also

54:33.060 --> 54:36.520
say, interviewing sucks for the interviewer.

54:36.520 --> 54:44.900
Interviewing is time consuming, interviewing is stressful, interviewing is oftentimes just

54:44.900 --> 54:46.960
not an area of focus for people.

54:46.960 --> 54:51.000
So employers really want you to be successful.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.580
They're not going into it like, despite the old view of sort of three people sitting on

54:55.580 --> 55:01.220
a panel across from you and them sort of challenging you to show that you're worth there.

55:01.220 --> 55:02.540
They want you to be successful.

55:02.540 --> 55:06.300
By the time you get into the interview, they already like you.

55:06.300 --> 55:11.500
It's your job just to sort of show them why and to demonstrate that.

55:11.500 --> 55:14.740
Yeah, does that kind of answer that question?

55:14.740 --> 55:15.740
Yeah, yeah.

55:15.740 --> 55:21.620
And I spoke to somebody during the week for a different recording, a different episode,

55:21.620 --> 55:26.220
and they said an interesting thing, which I kind of knew, but I forgot about the fact

55:26.220 --> 55:28.220
that that is actually the most important thing.

55:28.220 --> 55:31.820
The most important thing almost when you're in an interview is, yeah, sure, your tech

55:31.820 --> 55:32.940
skills is important.

55:32.940 --> 55:37.460
And some companies focus too heavily on that, especially when they have like all these crazy

55:37.460 --> 55:43.980
algorithms and stuff like that and the dreaded whiteboard challenges.

55:43.980 --> 55:48.460
But companies that take a different approach to this, a more healthier approach, generally

55:48.460 --> 55:53.340
what they want to understand is what value do you bring to the company?

55:53.340 --> 55:55.360
And that is what you have to focus on.

55:55.360 --> 56:00.500
If they hire you, how will it make their company better?

56:00.500 --> 56:02.460
I think that is what they really want, right?

56:02.460 --> 56:07.460
Like sure, they know they need another developer because there's a lot of work to do, but what

56:07.460 --> 56:09.700
is the value you bring?

56:09.700 --> 56:13.140
Is there like something in your background that's really unique?

56:13.140 --> 56:15.380
Do you have a unique perspective on the thing?

56:15.380 --> 56:20.640
And I think researching the company and therefore not just doing the thing where you just send

56:20.640 --> 56:25.500
out resumes to 200 companies and hoping somebody comes back to you, I think you have to instead

56:25.500 --> 56:29.400
like really go and do some research about companies that you would be interested in

56:29.400 --> 56:35.780
working for and find out what they're talking about, what they're blogging about.

56:35.780 --> 56:39.020
And if you have a unique idea, this is the time to bring it up.

56:39.020 --> 56:40.020
It's in that interview.

56:40.020 --> 56:44.620
Like, so I read this thing that you wrote and I really liked the idea, but I was thinking

56:44.620 --> 56:46.060
and I think blah, blah, blah.

56:46.060 --> 56:50.780
I think that is the conversations that's going to get you in the door more than just your

56:50.780 --> 56:53.020
technical skills by itself.

56:53.020 --> 56:54.460
Absolutely.

56:54.460 --> 56:58.980
I would say like it's always that last question that is asked by every interviewer everywhere

56:58.980 --> 57:04.500
in the world, which is, do you have any questions for us, which is actually like the one that's

57:04.500 --> 57:10.220
going to like land you in that job or could just be a thing that you miss out on?

57:10.220 --> 57:14.860
It's such a huge opportunity, especially if you're going in and your questions are only

57:14.860 --> 57:24.860
around what's the salary like or like what's the like some very low level or just surface

57:24.860 --> 57:25.860
level piece.

57:25.860 --> 57:30.380
You're actually digging in and being like, so yeah, I saw this post and like, how did

57:30.380 --> 57:33.460
you decide that that was the way that you were going to pursue?

57:33.460 --> 57:35.260
Like opening the conversation, right?

57:35.260 --> 57:37.740
It shows that you're interested in what they're doing.

57:37.740 --> 57:38.820
I couldn't agree more.

57:38.820 --> 57:43.540
I think there's huge power in a question that seems like it's just a filler.

57:43.540 --> 57:44.780
Yeah, for sure.

57:44.780 --> 57:49.820
I think that's super important and I think people have the wrong perception of that question.

57:49.820 --> 57:53.160
That question isn't just asked.

57:53.160 --> 58:00.700
I think that question is asked deliberately to see if you have the confidence to ask questions

58:00.700 --> 58:03.780
because I think a lot of people are like, oh, I don't want to waste their time.

58:03.780 --> 58:05.700
No, people actually want you.

58:05.700 --> 58:06.700
That's critical.

58:06.700 --> 58:14.380
I know I've interviewed people for positions and I've almost always had a much better feeling

58:14.380 --> 58:24.540
about candidates that had insightful questions and not about how much money or working hours,

58:24.540 --> 58:28.020
but more stuff about the culture of the company.

58:28.020 --> 58:30.740
How do you work together as a team?

58:30.740 --> 58:35.380
What are the goals for the company in the next six months?

58:35.380 --> 58:41.100
And then when you tell them the things you can about all these things to have follow-ups,

58:41.100 --> 58:47.260
to actually actively listen and then have follow-up questions in the moment.

58:47.260 --> 58:50.420
What we're talking now, a lot of this is not rehearsed.

58:50.420 --> 58:54.500
I say a thing, you teal from that, I teal from that.

58:54.500 --> 59:00.920
I think that is what really gets you in because that creates a human connection with the interviewer.

59:00.920 --> 59:05.900
So it becomes less of an interviewer-interviewee and it becomes a conversation between two

59:05.900 --> 59:08.580
people that just want to make the company succeed.

59:08.580 --> 59:11.380
I think that is something that people forget.

59:11.380 --> 59:12.380
Absolutely.

59:12.380 --> 59:13.380
Right?

59:13.380 --> 59:16.060
I mean, at the end of the day, people that are interviewing, they're interviewing to

59:16.060 --> 59:18.100
see if you're a good fit with the team.

59:18.100 --> 59:21.860
While that causes, I think, some challenges because in a lot of cases, that means that

59:21.860 --> 59:28.500
you end up hiring a lot of people that look the same or think the same way.

59:28.500 --> 59:32.820
Going into it, recognizing that really people are wanting to know who you are as a person

59:32.820 --> 59:35.720
and not necessarily the things that you've done in the past.

59:35.720 --> 59:38.500
It's more about who you are and traits, right?

59:38.500 --> 59:44.620
I think, I mean, we talked about problem solving, but things like coachability and teachability

59:44.620 --> 59:56.060
and passion for curiosity, if somebody sparks within their conversation that they love learning,

59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.180
that is more powerful to me than if they can solve the most complex problem because there

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.660
will always be a more complex problem.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:09.460
If you're only worried about being able to demonstrate you can solve it, that's only

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.940
going to get you so far.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.940
Yeah.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:12.940
That's for sure.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:13.940
That's for sure.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:14.940
Yeah.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:15.940
I agree.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:19.100
I think we're an hour in.

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.100
Wow.

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:21.100
I can't believe it.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:27.100
I think I just have maybe one or two more things and then if you have anything also.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:33.980
Talking about when you're not making awesome battle snakes or writing blog posts, what

01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:38.260
are the things that interest you in this world outside of maybe even outside of tech?

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.380
I know for a lot of people when you ask that question, they're like, I still do tech stuff

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.700
for my free time.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.700
And that's totally fine.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:48.580
What do you like to do when you're not on the job?

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.060
Yeah.

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.260
So I'm kind of there.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.580
I'm trying to get away from it.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:01:00.180
So I guess I've come to the tech industry through a lot of like windy, wavy processes

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.180
and experiences.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:07.340
So what's interesting is I really only within the past sort of I would say five years have

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.340
I really been in the technology space.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:16.460
So much of my time up until then was the thing I would do in my spare time was tech stuff.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.600
And now I'm kind of getting paid for doing tech related things.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.760
And so I still do tech stuff in my spare time.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.420
But thankfully, my lovely wife is definitely not that person.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:32.660
She is definitely the outdoor person who enjoys like experience in the world where we live

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:38.700
in British Columbia and on Vancouver Island specifically is absolutely gorgeous.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.580
So we are one of the things that's a big thing for us is hiking.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:48.340
So we hike and I say this and may regret it, but we hike religiously.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.140
And it's just because it happens on Sundays.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.140
We do it every Sunday.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.140
We'll drive.

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.420
We'll hike for a couple of hours.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:02:00.460
And it's such a getting back to like grounding yourself on a weekly basis, especially when

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:05.640
you're sitting and staring at a computer screen for many, many hours a day is such a such a

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.640
powerful thing.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.540
And then, yeah, right.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.540
And like, what about you?

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.540
What about you?

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:16.340
What do you do in the non in the non tech related time shelf?

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:21.300
Pretty much a lot of the same, to be honest, we don't have a ton of hiking things we used

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.220
to do it and then we kind of like fellow with COVID and stuff like that.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.420
We kind of like lost that but we're trying to get back.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.220
The problem is we have pets that we'd like to take on a hike.

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:34.220
And in South Africa, it's kind of hard to find places that's bed friendly, like if you

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.820
have a dog that you want to take with stuff like that.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:42.220
So we're currently like actually researching and trying to find places that is dog friendly

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.240
because we do enjoy that as a family.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.460
So that's something that we'd like to do again.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.060
But we have a golf course close to us.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.800
And they kind of have a walking path there.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:52.840
And that's dog friendly.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.920
So that's something that we do like in the week, like maybe you just feel like I need

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:00.420
an hour's break and just the kids we take the dogs and we just could take a walk.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.840
And it's it's it's amazing what it does to your mental health.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.820
Just taking that break.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:06.820
Absolutely.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.820
Yeah.

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:13.520
And then I guess the other the other thing that the tech the tech fun thing that I do.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:19.340
So so when I was going through teachers college and I did my master's in education as well,

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:24.380
and it was specifically focused on sort of like alternative educational assessment of

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:28.660
sort of like reimagining what the report card is and how it can help learners.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:32.820
And so when I initially developed it, it was sort of a it was like a form.

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.620
It was like a rubric.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:39.500
And then I built as part of my my thesis, I ended up building sort of a Google Google

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.940
Apps app, like basically using the Google Sheets and just sort of building a pseudo

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.220
database in the background.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:50.100
And then when I was done, I went and pitched it to the school that I'd been working with.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.860
And they said, could it have this function?

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.540
Could you turn it into a web app?

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.100
And that was a dangerous thing to say, because while I said no, initially, then I was like,

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.100
could I?

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.580
I don't know how to do this, but could I?

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:07.140
And and and now like a year later, I'm still actively working on it, like in every spare

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.900
moment that I have.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.540
I have that exact same problem.

01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:16.180
I constantly maybe I start working at one thing and then I'm like, what if I can do

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.180
that?

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.180
I can't.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.180
Oh, cool.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:22.020
And then, oh, but if I can do that, I wonder if I can do that.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.540
And before you know it, it's like three hours later.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:29.620
And there's like, thing that maybe was at one purpose can now do all these different

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.620
things.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:36.620
And I think that is just that's just the natural curiosity that that is part of the industry.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:37.620
I so agree.

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:41.060
I feel like that I was talking to somebody yesterday who's a professional software developer

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:45.220
and they were saying the same thing of like, you can do anything like what?

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:49.540
That's the very cool thing about tech is almost anything you can imagine you can do.

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.340
The question is, should you should you do it?

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.260
But also, like being able to like time box yourself, right?

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.780
Put yourself in this time period.

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.460
But yeah, like this app, this app started out very simple.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.040
And then as I learn, as you learn more and you discover the features and you actually

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:08.540
start to understand how things work, you're like, OK, I can do this.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:12.300
But you're just like you said, it's like you're like, I'm going to do this in a half an hour.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.300
Four hours later, as you're like sweating because your problem solving is like not getting

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.100
you to the place you need to go.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:24.780
Again, I'm very glad I have a non sort of tech wife like my partner is just like enjoys

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.820
can use computers very well, but is not the developer.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.140
And she's like, you need to walk away from this.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.480
You need to go.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.480
And we need to go for that.

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.380
Like, no, for sure, that's super important to have that balance.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:39.780
It's good if you have somebody that can like literally drag you away from the left and

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:41.780
say, that's enough now.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.000
It's brilliant.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.700
So in closing, is there anything else you'd like to share with us?

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:51.420
Any like putting words, words of wisdom, anything that you'd like to share?

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:58.620
Yeah, so I think my my only words of wisdom that I can provide and this comes from experience

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:06.780
and from talking to a lot of people, be curious, be focused on learning and growing a growth

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:12.980
mindset will bring you farther in not only the technology industry, but any industry.

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.820
It's going to make you a massively valuable asset that keeps growing.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:22.620
And it's going to help you to discover things that you didn't even know about yourself.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:27.020
And in terms of that growth mindset, don't just let it be about things that you can do.

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:31.180
Let it be about internal growth as well and discovering who you are and things that you

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.820
enjoy.

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.820
Technology is spectacular, and it can help you do a lot of things for others.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:42.620
But really take time to focus on yourself and discover, learn more about yourself and

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.780
take time there as well.

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.620
So grow outwards and also grow inwards.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.140
That is super valuable advice.

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.140
Thanks for sharing that.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.780
Well, thank you, Andrew.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.460
This was this was really great.

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:58.260
I mean, it's been added for over an hour and it surely doesn't feel like it.

01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:02.700
Thanks so much for taking time on your Friday to speak with me and share all this wonderful

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.100
information with our community.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.540

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:07.540
Amazing.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.460
And thank you so much for having me.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:15.500

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.940
And so thank you so much for having me.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.020
I cannot tell you how much I appreciate it.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.020
You're so welcome.

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:31.020
And thanks for the kind words.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:32.020
I really appreciate it.

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:33.020
Have a good day, man.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:34.020
Cheers.

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:35.020
All right, you too.
