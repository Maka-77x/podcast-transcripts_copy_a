Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage work developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,880
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,200
Hey, Andrew.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,600
Thanks so much for joining me for today's podcast.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
How are you doing?

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,040
Oh my goodness, I am doing fantastic.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,440
We've got a bright, sunshiny day out here on the west coast of Canada just before we

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,960
move into our rainy season.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,200
So I'm having a good day, and I'm getting to talk to you too, which is a pretty fantastic

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,400
way to start my weekend.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,920
Yeah, for sure, for sure.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,760
Yeah, the weather over here is also pretty decent.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,680
It's hot, and it's too soon to be this hot, but I think the weekend is looking pretty

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
decent.

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,320
So yeah, that's good.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,640
So I found you on Polywork, I'm really appreciative to Polywork because I had this idea, I thought

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,920
I'd just put it out there and see if people were interested, and I was overwhelmed by

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,600
the response, so much so that I've been finding it hard to keep up with getting back to people

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,560
and saying like, oh my goodness, yeah, let's do this.

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,640
So you're one of the first folks that reached out, actually, and I read a little bit about

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,840
your background, and I thought this is perfect for the show.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,260
So I'm not going to speak about who you are because you know you are better than me.

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,920
So I'm going to listen and I'm going to let you take as much time as you need, go as far

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,480
back as you want to, and tell us your story.

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,040
Oh, I don't know about that.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,080
You might have gotten more about me from the backgrounds that I sent in than I'm even going

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,280
to remember today.

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,560
But yeah, I mean, I guess I'll start with kind of where I am now and maybe go a little

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,600
bit further backwards.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,560
So I'm an educator based here in British Columbia, Canada, so just on the west coast of Canada,

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,520
the big focus around technology education and educational technologies.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,160
So I've worked in the middle school, high school, post-secondary levels, and sort of

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,880
throughout the entire time that I've been in the world of education and the world of

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,440
sort of training other people to do it, I've spent sort of my entire career also just exploring

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
technology.

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,520
I mean, I remember my first job post-graduation from a non-tech related tech related degree

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,680
was to build a website for an organization that I was working for.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,920
And it was kind of my first taste of what this looked like professionally.

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,780
Yeah, yeah.

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,200
So technology enthusiast, really passionate about exploring ways to get people excited

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,680
about technology and to look at alternative ways of teaching people technology.

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,400
And I also work in the industry as a community manager for a really amazing company here

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,960
in Canada called Battlesnake, and I'm sure I'll get a chance to talk about them a little

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
bit later.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Yeah, for sure.

46
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,760
I definitely want you to talk about that.

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,160
I saw that and I was like, what is this?

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,360
This sounds really interesting.

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,560
So it's kind of cool because so you're a teacher that also teaches teachers, which is like

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
inception.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,160
That's really cool.

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,680
So as you know, the whole idea behind this podcast and the community that I've started

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:23,800
is all about helping early stage developers get into this industry in a welcoming, friendly

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:32,880
way and help them identify by talking to them, but also by talking to teachers and mentors,

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,240
find where is the missing pieces?

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,040
What are things that's not working so that we can find ways of improving this so that

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,440
the pain, the struggles that we might have gone through when we started, we don't have

58
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,280
to repeat that for the next wave of folks getting into the industry.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,520
And I think one of the things that's also very important to me is to invite and include

60
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,560
everybody irrespective of where you are in your career development and irrespective of

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:10,080
where you live and irrespective of your gender, your background, your choice of how you identify

62
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
yourself.

63
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,400
Like I want this to be a welcoming place for everybody where they can feel they can talk

64
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,520
openly and freely about what works and what doesn't celebrate their wins and celebrate

65
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,000
the failures.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,220
So that is a lot.

67
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,720
With all of that said, as a teacher who teaches teachers, but also teaches students, what

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,700
advice do you have for both those bodies, I guess, anything that in your time spent

69
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,600
doing this, anything that you have found that's like maybe not worked so well and that you

70
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,480
found like, oh, these are better ways of addressing.

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,560
So either speak to students or specifically to the industry in general.

72
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,200
Yeah, I mean, this was it's so funny.

73
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,800
So I got to say, first off, I absolutely love that mission, this idea of inclusiveness and

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,120
accessibility to this world, even though technology industry is everywhere and almost every company

75
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,560
is a technology company now, particularly on the developer side, I mean, around certainly

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,480
in North America, but I think around the world, it is still historically a very dominated

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,320
by a very specific population.

78
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,120
And so any initiatives that can be done that will enable people that are not coming from

79
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,120
that dominant culture to enter this space, I think is incredibly important.

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,880
So huge kudos for the Mycelium Network podcast and the work that you're doing in this space.

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
All right.

82
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Yeah.

83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
So and then answer your question.

84
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,800
So it's interesting.

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:50,040
So this was exactly what you're talking about and the exact reason behind Mycelium

86
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,720
Network was actually one of the big pieces behind one of the initiatives that I'm most

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,360
proud of that I helped to develop in sort of this technology education space, which

88
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,320
was a program called High Tech U.

89
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,440
So it was a it's a program based out of the University of Victoria, which is a fairly

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,840
large research intensive university here in here in Victoria, British Columbia has a really

91
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,920
spectacular software engineering and computer science program.

92
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:29,280
But much like the rest of the world, not necessarily turning out the number of folks that need

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,520
to be to be produced at a post secondary institutions to prepare them for for industry and in many

94
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,240
ways turning out the same type of people that are dominating the industry right now, which

95
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,120
is not necessarily that sort of perpetuation cycle that we're looking to do.

96
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,800
So with this initiative, it was very specifically focused on the exact thing that Mycelium is

97
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,720
is sort of really focused on, which is how can we how can we create a safe, accessible

98
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,940
environment that will enable folks that didn't necessarily see themselves in technology to

99
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,160
find their place in the industry, be it as somebody working in customer support or somebody

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,000
that's working on on back end, but helping them find a place.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,240
And I can go into detail about kind of what that program looked like.

102
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,280
But I think the biggest the biggest thing that that came out of that initiative and I ran

103
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,500
it for for three years and built it up with a great team was kind of counterintuitive

104
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,800
to get people excited about tech.

105
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,240
It's less about the tech itself and more about the problems that that technology can

106
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:44,800
solve and really just enabling people to gain an understanding of how they can use these

107
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,040
free amazing resources that are out there to solve a problem for them and switching

108
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,680
this world of you need to be the sort of glasses in your basement with the hoodie eating, eating

109
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,080
nacho chips and drinking soda, which we all love to do.

110
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,640
But that's kind of that archetypical computer scientist look right.

111
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,760
And so, yeah, yeah, we really focus there on on switching to the problem solving and

112
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,520
then getting people excited about tech and then sort of showing them the different gateways

113
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,600
that are there.

114
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
That sounds great.

115
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,640
Yeah, I'm totally for the problem solving thing, because I think one of the challenges

116
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,320
that I've heard over and over and over again, and I experienced it myself, if you if you

117
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,120
are transitioning from one because I used to be a musician and then I found it hard

118
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,640
to make a living.

119
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:38,680
I got married and had a kid and so it was it was hard and I couldn't financially sustain

120
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
us.

121
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,000
I mean, thankfully, I had had parents that could help us.

122
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,400
But you know, as as a twenty one, twenty two year old, you don't want your daddy to look

123
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
off to you.

124
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
You want be independent.

125
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Right.

126
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
You're like her.

127
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,600
So so I had to find some way of making money.

128
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:04,720
And at that time, flash was still a big thing, and that was my like gateway drug into this

129
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,360
because it allowed me to combine different things.

130
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Right.

131
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,120
It allowed me because I was I was like, oh, I can do animation with this thing.

132
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
That's cool.

133
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,840
And I can use music because back in the day, like in the early 2000s, like 2000, 2001,

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,760
it was pretty popular to have this little like fancy intro with animation and music

135
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,320
and like stuff, and then you add a button there again to enter the website.

136
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,760
So I ended up building quite a few of those like intros for clients.

137
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,760
So that that allowed me to give creative expression to myself and still have this little connection

138
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,900
to my musical career, but also start like getting into the texting.

139
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:53,560
And so but with that said, it was still hard because even when I was freelancing, how do

140
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,440
you get a client if you have no work to show?

141
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Right.

142
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,160
So now you have to like try and create these like pseudo projects that don't really exist.

143
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
It's not for anybody.

144
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:12,240
You have to somehow get yourself inspired to do this thing, just to say that, oh, here's

145
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,560
the thing I bought, it's not really for anybody, but you can kind of see my skills, right?

146
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,760
But it's me by myself alone and get up in these things that didn't even exist back then.

147
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,360
So it's like literally me putting it on a URL and pointing it to it.

148
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
So it was hard.

149
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
It was really tough.

150
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,160
And then again, I realized that maybe freelancing isn't going to work.

151
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:44,320
I struggled to build my business to a point where I felt like we as a family will be financially

152
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,480
stable and so I decided to join the workforce.

153
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,800
And that was tough because I've been doing it for like two, three years at that point,

154
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,400
but I had very little experience to show for that because a lot of the things I did was

155
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:05,000
literally make things for myself as a means of having like designing logos for fictitious

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,360
companies and stuff like that.

157
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,160
And so that's one of the things that I want to do as part of the Mycelium network is to

158
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,240
anything that we do, like for example, the Mycelium network needs a website, right?

159
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,160
So I want to do that with the community.

160
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,520
I don't want to go and build it.

161
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,480
I want to do it with the community and I want to do it like a for real project.

162
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,240
You know, we have a project board on GitHub, we have tasks, people get assigned to tasks,

163
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,200
people need to do full request reviews, people need to read each other's code, all that kind

164
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
of stuff.

165
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,080
And be involved in how do we take that thing and get it live on the internet.

166
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:47,840
Because the awesome thing about GitHub is it's open and so you can point any potential

167
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,600
employer to the work you've done.

168
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,700
And the nice thing if you do it in this like, so it's great to contribute to open source

169
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,700
in general.

170
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,280
I think it's a good way to get experience in that kind of thing.

171
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,080
But if you're involved in something that's run as a structured project, you also show

172
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,880
the employer that you can work as part of a team.

173
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,320
You can take criticism, deal with it, not give up, maybe push back even if you feel

174
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,880
strongly about it and come to a consensus and land your work.

175
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,520
I think that is a really good way.

176
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,040
So I think the thing that you mentioned about high tech you and how you looked at specifically

177
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,680
problem solving, I think that's key and I think it's a key thing that's missing.

178
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,800
So I'm curious, what do you think about all of that?

179
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,660
How did you address this whole thing of creating problems for people to solve, to have a means

180
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,840
of signaling to employers what they're capable of?

181
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,340
Absolutely.

182
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,340
And you're totally right.

183
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,360
I mean, there's so many courses that you can do out there.

184
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,780
And if you look on, it's interesting if you go on to GitHub and you look for projects

185
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,960
a lot of the time, right?

186
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,180
You'll find these half finished repos of like a project that somebody had to do as part

187
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,460
of this course and there's no documentation.

188
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,880
It's obviously something they did and it's almost discouraging.

189
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,920
But there is such power in that world of GitHub and open source and I'm super excited to

190
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,160
chat like open source and how that plays in.

191
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,280
But for us, one of the big pieces and it ties into the creativity piece as well is we spent,

192
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:27,320
so the kind of core program that we ran was like a five day long, I call it kind of an

193
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,860
extended hackathon for beginners.

194
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,740
So instead of sort of coming in and giving a problem statement or giving like a theme,

195
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,420
we would sort of have them come in and we would teach them the fundamentals that they

196
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,860
needed to know and then just kind of put them out there in the world.

197
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,100
And we brought in mentors from local technology companies who would basically just be there

198
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,320
floating around.

199
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,400
So whereas unlike that traditional hackathon that you go to where you might have that,

200
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,840
but it's generally about tapping into the expertise that's in your team or in your

201
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,360
friend group.

202
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,160
This was the expectation that nobody was coming in with any knowledge and then the mentors

203
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,220
were just kind of there and able to support when questions came up.

204
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,440
But within the world of the problem solving and ensuring that this was something that's

205
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,980
going to be valuable for the students, one of the big pieces of that onboarding process

206
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,500
was actually having them gain an understanding of design thinking from like the very base

207
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:25,100
level of going and finding a problem that is relevant to a user base.

208
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:32,020
And the unique thing in that program was we had about 16 high school age students that

209
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,460
were there from grade nine to 12 and we said, great, within this sort of like this captured

210
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,960
user group, go talk to each other and see what problems you can find within this group

211
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,100
of 16 youth.

212
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,060
So you've got your target market is there.

213
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,640
You're building something that solves a problem for young people.

214
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,720
You're going to do the user research all within like this super fast like hour long

215
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,440
period and then we're going to work with you to identify the thing that you can actually

216
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:07,580
accomplish with your skill level in this sort of like three days fundamentally of programming.

217
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,140
And so that was a really powerful thing within this model of the projects that they were

218
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,020
creating is every project that they were creating, they could speak to like why this is an issue

219
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,860
because they're the user for it.

220
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,460
And even if they're not the perfect user, the super user, the early adopter, they're

221
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,180
going to get it because they're in that headspace.

222
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,180
That's super clever.

223
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,420
I really, I haven't thought about that angle.

224
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,420
That's really nice.

225
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,020
Like essentially telling your community, hey, instead of me bringing a project to you, you

226
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,260
can bring a project to me by talking to each other.

227
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,380
That's really clever.

228
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,500
I really like that.

229
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
That's a nice one.

230
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,540
And okay, cool.

231
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,060
So you've kind of like opened the door to open source and you said that you'd be really

232
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
keen to talk about it.

233
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,280
And it was one of my questions.

234
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,580
So let's dive into it right now.

235
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,220
Why do you, how do you see open source?

236
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,780
What role does it play in teaching and learning?

237
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,260
So from both sides and it's a big topic.

238
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Oh my goodness.

239
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,260
Yeah.

240
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,980
I love big topic though.

241
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
This is good.

242
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,060
It has three directions.

243
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:13,060
So I mean, in terms of, I mean, I can talk about my experience using it within sort of

244
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,660
teaching environments and then also just personally, cause I'm, I'm sort of learning this web development

245
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
experience.

246
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,420
So, so from the teaching perspective, one of the really great things that I've found

247
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:36,700
is the open source world has really invited new developers to get a deeper understanding

248
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,540
of the technology that's out there and that they're using every day.

249
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,260
Whereas in the past, again, very similar to this project idea, if you wanted to see what

250
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,620
code looked like for a project, you would have to go and find somebody that had published

251
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,060
on their personal website or on some other service, some fairly boring project that was

252
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,580
maybe in a language that you weren't interested in to now the world where literally you're

253
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,540
excited about, maybe you're excited about live streaming and you want to, you want to

254
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,660
see like the code behind Twitch.

255
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,260
Now not all of it is going to be exposed, but you can go and take a look and sort of

256
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,820
see like, Hey, this is the stuff that's underlying this technology.

257
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:21,020
So I think there's a level of playing to people's interests and allowing them to get

258
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,620
exposed to programming through exploring areas and topics that they're passionate about.

259
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,980
I mean, I teach, so I teach at a middle school level.

260
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,740
So I deal with learners that are doing things on sort of Minecraft and mind test a lot.

261
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,420
That's a big thing with the age group that I work with and the mod community in there

262
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,340
is huge.

263
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,380
And the cool thing is I have kids learning about open source without ever knowing the

264
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,860
word open source.

265
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,120
They go and search Minecraft mod that does this thing.

266
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,380
They end up on GitHub.

267
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,460
They pull the code down, they're reviewing it and just based on their interest level,

268
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,420
they're going in and they're discovering sort of open source.

269
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,580
And that's opening the door to saying like, this isn't this ethereal thing that I can't

270
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,420
understand or I'll never be able to wrap my mind around.

271
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,080
They're actually letting me in the door.

272
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,820
So I think accessibility is huge there.

273
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,340
I think for me personally, as a learner who's been going through the development process,

274
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,460
what I love is I've always been the kind of person that if I did a course, like where

275
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,780
I'm building something, I'm going to get to step three of seven and I'm going to be out.

276
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
I'm going to be done.

277
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,340
I'm like, ah, this isn't something that I'm really interested in.

278
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,100
What I love doing and what I found really powerful about open source is actually being

279
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,860
able to just go and grab somebody's code and then mess around with it.

280
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,220
Like have a working piece of code and then to go in there and I'm going to change a

281
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,140
variable or like alter a method and I'm going to see the issue and the change that that

282
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,860
does in there.

283
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,220
And that's like, it's been a super powerful part of my learning journey is having this

284
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,020
massive resource to go and dig into code like that.

285
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Yeah.

286
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Yeah.

287
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,020
For sure.

288
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:10,500
I was just about to ask you, like, I wonder how effective it is to, for example, present

289
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,380
and while this is not somebody that's beginning, beginning, but somebody that's like had a

290
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,820
little bit of learning of HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to create like a super simple

291
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
project, right?

292
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,260
It's like, say for example, a mobile navigation, right?

293
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,540
So it has a little hamburger menu.

294
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,140
When you click it, it opens a thing.

295
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,860
When you click it again, it closes it.

296
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:36,780
And so it does a couple of things, you know, it like it acts, it reacts to the user.

297
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,220
It changes the icon based on the state of the menu.

298
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,700
And then to tell students, okay, here's the code that makes that happen.

299
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:57,020
Can you look at it, read through the code and write a blog post explaining how it works?

300
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,380
I've often thought if that would be an interesting approach for learners.

301
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,300
100% and at every level.

302
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,820
So for the high tech U program, we built out the Academy.

303
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,620
That's exactly kind of what we did, not the blog post angle, but we would actually give

304
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,500
them a template that was a functional template, but it was the most basic template, right?

305
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,220
So in our first iteration, they were doing really simple web apps built on, I think Node

306
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
or something like that.

307
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,900
And it was just, it would basically spit out a thing that said, hello world.

308
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,100
The most recent iteration, we did the same thing with the GitHub template, but it was

309
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,820
a discord bot and you would sort of follow the steps and it would give it.

310
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,900
But again, it was not the build part one, two, three, and eventually you'll get to

311
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,340
a bot from day one.

312
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,100
You had a functional thing and your role was to customize it, which was huge.

313
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,660
And that kind of carries through even to the work that I do with Battlesnake.

314
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:56,060
And so within that, it's a very open source company, very community focused, but because

315
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:04,520
of the nature of what it is, the game itself requires you to build your own web server

316
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,780
in a different language.

317
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,420
And so we provide templates that are really dumb, dumb snakes that are competing in this

318
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,460
game that will not die.

319
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,260
They will do a thing, but it's not going to be super powerful.

320
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,060
And what's interesting there as well, that's I think even more unique about what we're

321
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:30,020
doing with that company is that let's say somebody is using a template and say Python

322
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,580
and they've learned how the Python template works.

323
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,700
And we've got a Go template or a Rust template.

324
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,380
They can then go and say like, okay, I see how it was laid out in Python.

325
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,820
I'm going to go over to Rust and see how it's laid out there.

326
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,620
And you're going to gain this really practical understanding just by looking at those different

327
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,300
templates that are accomplishing the same thing.

328
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,620
And yeah, I think that the whole world, when GitHub did templates, they shifted the game

329
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,460
in such a huge way for education.

330
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,580
That is for sure.

331
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,860
I've totally embraced that.

332
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:06,700
I've got this project called Project Calavera and it's very intentionally titled that way

333
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,240
because it's all about creating skeletons.

334
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:18,780
And some of them are the main one, the Project Calavera, Project Calavera is a CLI that basically

335
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,860
if you're starting a new project and so you want to add prettier, you want to add some

336
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,060
ESLent rules, you want to add style and rules, maybe you're using SAS, so you want to add

337
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,840
some SAS stuff.

338
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,700
That's kind of cumbersome, right?

339
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,980
Either after you create a template that you then every time fork or not fork, when you

340
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,100
create a new repo, you create it from that template, or you need to copy and paste stuff

341
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,500
from this GitHub repository you keep around with all your default configs.

342
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,900
So the way this one works is you basically run a CLI command and then you have some configuration

343
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,740
in your package JSON.

344
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,900
And based on that, it'll just spit out all that stuff for you.

345
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,600
And I take community input and I follow a bunch of projects that create these best practices

346
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,260
for what is the latest, greatest way to configure your ESLent or your style and how to configure

347
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,980
battle and stuff like that.

348
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,700
So it doesn't do framework things because that's why it says it's like a boilerplate

349
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,100
for new projects, bring your own framework, because I think frameworks oftentimes have

350
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,060
this built into their own little CLI.

351
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,300
So if you start up a new Vue project or you start up a new React project with one of these

352
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:34,180
like boilerplate things like create React app or the Vue CLI, it does that.

353
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,020
But there isn't something like that for somebody that's just like, oh, but I don't want to

354
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
use any framework.

355
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,820
I really, my needs are pretty simple, but I would like the linting and all that stuff

356
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,820
there.

357
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,420
But then the other side that the Project Calaverno project also contains are exactly these things.

358
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,340
So it's a basic template of a simple express server.

359
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,900
And so if you just want to create an express server, but you don't want to go and set up

360
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,300
the app.js and the default basic routes that you'll probably need and helmet to configure

361
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:10,460
security, you could just use the Calavera template and start your project from there.

362
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,060
And so you kind of can get the ground running and can get going quicker.

363
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:20,420
But at the same time, it introduces you to existing code.

364
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,540
So you might say like, oh, this is cool.

365
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,000
What's all these things that I just gave me?

366
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,300
And so I work hard on documenting like, this is what it does.

367
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
These are the things that brings in.

368
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,940
This is what each of these individual dependencies do for you.

369
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,660
But then people can go back and say, oh, you know what?

370
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,540
Actually this thing, I don't even think it should be part of the template or I think

371
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,780
this template is missing something or hey, I think you've got behind a little bit.

372
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,940
I'm quite good at express and we can improve it this way.

373
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,300
Or for new people, it's just, you can read through the code and say, oh, that is how

374
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:03,180
when I enter localhost 3000, it's serving the index pages because I have this get route

375
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,020
in this routes.js file.

376
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
Ah, gotcha.

377
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,700
Now I get it.

378
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,660
So yeah, I think that template thing you talked about is definitely, definitely key.

379
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,020
Absolutely.

380
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:19,740
And I think the other thing that you brought up that's super key about why open source

381
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,360
and maybe this is an open source since it really became a much larger thing in sort

382
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,140
of the 2000s.

383
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,400
But this idea of documentation, even like, even if you go through and do one of these

384
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,840
online courses where it's telling you the thing and you do it, once you get the final

385
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,020
project, generally it's not including like inline comments, right?

386
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,620
Where you're actually like commenting on a method or commenting on a variable to say

387
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,340
what this thing is for.

388
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,260
I think as soon as you open up your code to the world, it's forced individuals that are

389
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,700
either contributing or creating to do a much better job at documenting, same with companies.

390
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:03,300
And that's such a powerful thing for educational situations, learning situations is to be able

391
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,340
to go in and almost see line by line and it doesn't fit in every situation.

392
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:15,500
But for so many people to be able to reference back there on a regular basis is such a huge,

393
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,060
a huge piece.

394
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:22,460
And I certainly know like the framework that I, so I had programmed in PHP many years ago

395
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,820
and then heard it was terrible and moved away and then decided that I was going to build

396
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,100
a project in it.

397
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:37,180
But the framework that I chose, I chose specifically because the creator of it has incredible focus

398
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,420
on documentation for it.

399
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,740
So not only are the docs good, but like you can go into a controller, it's an MVC model.

400
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,980
So it's like, you can go into the controller, you can go into like new view and they're

401
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,900
all documented just incredibly well.

402
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,940
So you don't need to guess about things.

403
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
It's all provided for you.

404
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:57,500
Yeah, I know for sure, I think Nuxt is the view version.

405
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:04,260
I think Next is the react version, but either way, they let it say it's Nuxt.

406
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:09,780
Like it's so very well-documented because it generates a bunch of boilerplates for you,

407
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,780
right?

408
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,940
So it generates like folders and inside the folders and stuff.

409
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,780
And as you open each folder, there's a read me inside every folder that tells you what

410
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,640
the purpose of this folder and what's the purpose of the files in this folder.

411
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,860
So there's no guesswork here.

412
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,580
It's like, oh, I see.

413
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
That's what it is.

414
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,300
And it will, for example, say like, oh, there isn't, you will say, but wait a minute, there

415
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:35,420
isn't a store directory.

416
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,620
And then you'll see there's a read me where you would expect there to be store dot read

417
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,620
me.

418
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,420
And you're like, open that.

419
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,540
The reason there isn't a store is because Nuxt, this is the way the configuration works

420
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,780
and it generates the store for you.

421
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,360
So you never have to worry about the store and that is why it doesn't exist.

422
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,220
I'm really impressed with their documentation.

423
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,380
And I think the other side of documentation is opening it up to community for localization.

424
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:09,300
I think I saw a documentary about Vue.js and the creator, Evan Yu.

425
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:15,580
And one of the reasons Vue took off in China so much as opposed to React was literally

426
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,860
because Evan is originally Chinese, he lives in the US.

427
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,940
But for him, it was important to have the docs available in Chinese from the beginning.

428
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,660
And so he opened it up to the community and he did some of the translation himself.

429
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,980
And that is the main reason why Vue 1 overreact when it comes to China.

430
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,160
Because for the people in China, it was very important to have it available in their language.

431
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,180
And so that being there from the get go, over and above the fact that it was really good

432
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,380
documentation, the fact that it was available in their language made a big difference.

433
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:54,140
And the more I am involved in communities like Mercedes Network and other larger communities

434
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:02,220
I'm also involved with, I have gained an understanding and a respect for a lot of people that really

435
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,840
love their native language.

436
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,580
And for them, it's not like I can't speak English.

437
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,500
It is really like they have a passion for their language.

438
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,700
They have a passion for their culture.

439
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:18,820
And it's important to them to be able to read the content in their language.

440
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,740
And we often forget that.

441
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
It's in English.

442
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
Everybody can speak English, right?

443
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
Yeah.

444
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
It's not just about that.

445
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
There's more to it.

446
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740
There's more subtleties about it.

447
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,300
So I think it's important to encourage that when you run projects.

448
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,940
Absolutely.

449
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,220
I couldn't agree more.

450
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:42,060
I think we, yeah, it's the simple things that certainly as a native English speaker,

451
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:48,180
I love going into these frameworks and these tools and looking at this code and finding

452
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,020
it in my native language.

453
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:59,220
And yeah, I think there's been a really big, maybe not resurgence, or I think a big push

454
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:09,060
around the world with it really focusing more on making accessibility, not just about can

455
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,900
people use this, but also can people use it in a way that they feel the most safe and

456
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
comfortable.

457
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
Exactly.

458
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,900
Exactly.

459
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,900
I think the term accessibility is getting a lot of attention and I'm really, really happy

460
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,300
about that because that's one of the things that I'm really passionate about.

461
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,140
But I think people have also understood that the umbrella that's covered by accessibility

462
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,100
is much larger than what people have thought about in the past.

463
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,500
But I am super curious about Battlesnake.

464
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,020
And the more you talk about it, the more curious I get.

465
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,940
So I'm going to like, please tell us more about Battlesnake.

466
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Awesome.

467
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,940
Yeah.

468
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:53,100
So Battlesnake is a multiplayer programming game where your code is the controller and

469
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,740
you are building, basically, fundamentally, you're building a web server to compete in

470
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,580
the classic sort of Nokia phone game Snake.

471
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,500
Did you ever play that where you sort of the snake goes up and you try and eat and you

472
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,780
get longer and you try not to die?

473
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
Yep.

474
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
Yep.

475
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
Yeah, I played that a lot.

476
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,780
Yeah.

477
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
So it's that.

478
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:18,580
But it's now a programming game where folks build out, I guess, at a core level, they're

479
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:25,980
building out an AI snake that's going to compete against other AI snakes to try and win and

480
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,660
survive and win prizes or win points or win bragging rights or whatever you're looking

481
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,900
to get out of the platform.

482
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:43,020
And so it started out, I think, in the early aughts of the 2000s as a sort of a recruiting

483
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
event.

484
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,980
So it was run by a startup here in Victoria, and they would invite hundreds and what eventually

485
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:54,380
became thousands of developers to come in and basically do a hackathon, but all focused

486
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,300
on one specific problem, which was, can you build a snake that can beat the other snakes?

487
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,580
And it's since transformed into a global platform, more than 10,000 developers around the world

488
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:14,220
are playing this game right now and really has shifted from a focus on recruiting to

489
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,500
providing a really cool sandbox for professional developers to explore new technologies in

490
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,780
a way that isn't having them just sort of build out a project that's kind of boring.

491
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,820
Yeah, that's super cool.

492
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,860
I wonder, I've been seeing like these, I haven't checked on them yet.

493
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,300
I don't know why, but anyway, I've been seeing videos pop up in my YouTube recommendations

494
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,580
that's around the Nokia snake thing, and now I'm starting to wonder, is this Battlesnake

495
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
related?

496
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,300
So I'm definitely going to click on one of those just after this chat and see if it's

497
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
all about this.

498
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,420
But I'm also going to look at Battlesnake and try and give it a go.

499
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:58,140
So can you kind of create like a little community and say like, we're going to build the Mycelium

500
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,220
network snake and see if it can like beat stuff?

501
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,060
Yeah, so this is the cool thing.

502
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:07,580
So this is a feature that's like very sort of early days.

503
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,820
It's kind of, we've gone through many iterations, but yeah, so we're in the process of building

504
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,860
out features where you would have a team and it would basically be, you would sign up for

505
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,060
the Mycelium network team and then your snake would be represented as the Mycelium network

506
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
there.

507
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,880
But already, I think we just launched the feature really recently where you can run

508
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,640
sort of a Mycelium network tournament where people will build their own snakes and go

509
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,820
and build them and then you'll run sort of a small competition and it auto generates

510
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,700
the brackets and the ladders.

511
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,060
And so basically you just press a button that says play and it'll have these big, the games

512
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,900
will show up and it's super exciting to watch.

513
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:54,380
It's one of these situations that is as close to sort of a sporting event for competitive

514
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,300
programming or for collaborative programming as you can possibly get.

515
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:04,100
And it's good if you got to – our CEO, our co-founder has young kids and they love

516
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,780
tuning in anytime we have a tournament.

517
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,920
Because it's just bright colors and fun designs that are going around on the stage

518
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,880
or around the screen.

519
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,020
But they love it and they're cheering for their favorite snake and hoping that they

520
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
win.

521
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,020
And yeah, it's pretty amazing.

522
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,420
That was very much like BattleBots, right?

523
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Exactly.

524
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,940
I love watching that, where people like build these bots and then they try and destroy the

525
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
other bot.

526
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,940
Exactly, yeah.

527
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,140
It's such a nerdy thing, but it's so fun.

528
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,140
Totally.

529
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,140
And that's just it.

530
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,140
It is.

531
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,460
And now, that was always for, right, you had to be an electrical engineer or mechanical

532
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,620
engineer to build those bots.

533
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,220
Now it's like you can be a software developer with a year of experience or one that has

534
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,400
10 years of experience, and you can go and build this really cool thing that teaches

535
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:55,060
you a new language or a new technology stack and really do it in a way that you're not

536
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:59,580
just building a project that's going to sit in a repository somewhere and that nobody's

537
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,780
going to care about.

538
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,620
You're invested in this code that you've created in a way that it's personified.

539
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:11,300
You can add custom skins to it, so you can have heads and tails that are from a big list

540
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,060
of customizations, and you can get points to get more of them.

541
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,260
Yeah, it's just so exciting.

542
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,620
One of the big reasons that that has been super successful is A, open source.

543
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,600
Almost all of the platform, all of the key components of it are open source.

544
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,340
We have folks contributing to it all the time, but also community has been a massive, massive

545
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:37,620
part of its success of just enabling the community to get in there and get their hands dirty

546
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
with code.

547
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
That's awesome.

548
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,460
Yeah, I was about to ask about the open source thing, because I remember you mentioned that,

549
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,060
and I was like, oh, wow.

550
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,940
I guess there's quite a lot of opportunity for folks to also contribute directly to the

551
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
project.

552
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
Yeah.

553
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,540
I mean, it's even gotten to the point where... We've had open source, and it's tying

554
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,420
this back to the documentation piece.

555
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:06,380
We've had a documentation repository forever that was really only managed by our team.

556
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,540
We really always wanted community members to join, but then we had a bunch of community

557
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,200
members that were like, I'd really like to see this in there, but I don't want to contribute

558
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,060
to the official documentation, so they created a separate documentation that we provided

559
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,820
support for, and now that's become our official documentation setup.

560
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,940
It's a community-led project that we were like, yes, this is the thing that we really

561
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,540
want to adopt.

562
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:36,100
That's at this core level now, this code that is such a core piece of what we do is something

563
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,660
that our community said, we can do it better.

564
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,660
Yeah.

565
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,660
Yeah.

566
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,780
I mean, that is where diversity comes in, right?

567
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,220
Often times, if you open it up to the world and say, poke at our stuff and tell us if

568
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,460
you can think of better ways of doing it, more often than not, it does happen.

569
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:57,700
I love the fact that the company was willing to embrace this, because so often, people

570
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,660
are very precious about the things they make, if you know what I mean, and so they're like,

571
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,660
no, no, no, no, no.

572
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,380
They could not possibly be better than what we did, so kudos to the company for adopting

573
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,380
this.

574
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,380
I think it's amazing.

575
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,020
I've had a little poke at your website and LinkedIn and stuff like that, and I'm curious

576
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,180
about this one thing.

577
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:25,300
You've written scholarly documents on quantum computing.

578
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,260
Do you want to tell us about some of those?

579
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,540
You have linked to these citations.

580
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:34,660
I had a friend that worked at a quantum computing company for a little bit.

581
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,380
I've listened to the WIRED thing, where they explain it to me like I'm five.

582
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,900
I've listened to that, it's fascinating.

583
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:45,060
I still don't think I quite understand it, but I would love to hear your take on it.

584
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Absolutely.

585
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:53,780
Yeah, so when I was working with the team that built out the HITECH-U program at the

586
00:37:53,780 --> 00:38:00,220
University of Victoria, one of the co-founders and a huge mentor to me, Ulrika Staiga, she

587
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,020
was the chair of the computer science department at the University of Victoria at the time,

588
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:11,260
and her and her husband actually, who's also a professor at the University in Software

589
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:19,300
Engineering, have been the quintessential leaders in the space of quantum computing

590
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,380
education at the University of Victoria and actually arguably in British Columbia and

591
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,660
Canada and North America.

592
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,800
One of the key pieces when they were building out that sort of what quantum computing education

593
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,940
looks like, which was at a focus on the post-secondary level, was we want to make this accessible

594
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:40,580
for everybody because it's too late if they're in their postdocs to be learning about quantum

595
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,700
computing.

596
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,220
This is like a hugely up-and-coming field.

597
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:51,260
So yeah, so the initial iteration was we create a play on words, so we did instead of HITECH-U,

598
00:38:51,260 --> 00:39:01,060
we called it HITECH-Q, and really focus just on how can we take the core components of

599
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:07,180
quantum computing and make it accessible to a high school student.

600
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:16,260
And so the first year that we ran the workshop, we had some partners from IBM, and we were

601
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,500
able to get access to IBM's quantum computing, their actual quantum computer as well as their

602
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,660
simulation software, and gave learners this run through.

603
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,940
And what's really cool is the focus there was actually to build out a curriculum that

604
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,100
again was open source for people to use, where we were testing the waters to see what this

605
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,360
looked like at the high school level, and then we published a few papers to then say

606
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,580
here's where you can go and do it yourself.

607
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,580
Oh, brilliant.

608
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,580
Yeah, that's great.

609
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,420
I'll definitely close up, and I'm going to read them myself, that's for sure.

610
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,660
Another thing that I found that you wrote on this Battlesnake blog actually is deploying

611
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,940
web servers for free in 2022.

612
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:04,620
I think this is a key piece that's often missing.

613
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:09,100
A lot of people are like, okay, cool, I understand HTML and CSS, I think I'm starting to get

614
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:15,940
my pictographs JavaScript, but how the heck do I get this on a website?

615
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,700
It's cool, I get up, but I want my own URL and things, you want to talk about that a

616
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
little bit?

617
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,300
Oh yeah, absolutely.

618
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:29,260
This is one of these interesting situations that I run into as the non-developer working

619
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:35,220
for developers and doing things that newbies do.

620
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,700
There's a really cool initiative that we run through Battlesnake called our Developer

621
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:45,900
Fellowship, which is a program focused on providing support to women and non-binary

622
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,780
developers from across Canada who just don't have access to either people or mentorship

623
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,820
or resources.

624
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,700
Remember that one of the big pieces, super cool initiative, we do it with a bank here

625
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:03,520
in Canada called RBC who are just this spectacular partner for Battlesnake.

626
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,100
One of the pieces of that was educational opportunities.

627
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,580
I wanted to be able to go in with these developers that were joining and say, here's a bunch

628
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,700
of ways that you can deploy a Battlesnake to learn a new technology.

629
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,740
I spent a morning and I just went on all these platforms that I basically Googled, how can

630
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:24,180
I do this really fast and for cheap, and then did a timing and then our CEO Brad was like,

631
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,980
hey man, you need to do this as a legitimate blog post that you can share out more widely.

632
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:37,660
That queued up a two month journey of me going and finding even more platforms and trying

633
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,660
to build this out.

634
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,820
It doesn't necessarily look that way in the final blog post, but we've got more.

635
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,020
I deployed on about 12 different services and we were like, we're going to start with

636
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,060
the five that we have here and then go from there.

637
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,340
I don't know.

638
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:58,500
I fully understand, I heard a famous quote once where a person said, it took me four

639
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,340
hours to make a 10 minute video, so I totally understand.

640
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Absolutely.

641
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,860
Yeah, and I mean the focus with this, for anybody that wants to read it, it's really

642
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,460
cool if you go to blog.battlesnake.com, it's kind of linked on there.

643
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,980
But basically my focus with this was for folks that are at my level or early stage developers

644
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,460
that are not able to log into AWS and figure things out or they look at that and then they

645
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:28,100
run away screaming, was to look and find accessible, and I know we're using that word a lot, but

646
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:34,780
I mean accessible for the lay person or the new person to go in and within five minutes

647
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:40,820
ideally get a functional web server out there from an open source GitHub template.

648
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:47,780
And it's funny, so despite the fact that AWS and Azure and GCP kind of have the market

649
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:53,460
share for like large companies that are doing it, there's a lot of these smaller companies

650
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,380
that are coming out, especially now that Heroku has decided to remove their free plan in sort

651
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,020
of September, October.

652
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,580
There's more of these companies that are sort of releasing better free plans for people

653
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,820
to get there.

654
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:12,220
And so I got to do like massive shout out, there's a platform that is actually based

655
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,940
here in Canada as well, actually here on the West Coast, that is I think fundamentally

656
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,820
is a game changer in the open source deployment space called Railway.

657
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:27,260
And it's the most beautiful and smoothest platform that I've ever used.

658
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:33,180
They also include in their, when you're starting a new project with them, you can choose from

659
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,300
a bunch of open source projects and when you click deploy, it goes through and reads everything,

660
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,500
but it'll deploy the database, it'll deploy your server, it'll give you a public domain.

661
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,780
It's all free for like 500 hours a month.

662
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,980
So just like super, super cool.

663
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,980
Wow.

664
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,980
That is really impressive.

665
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,900
Yeah, I'll definitely check that out.

666
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,820
It's incredible the tooling that's becoming available, honestly, like the ability to just

667
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,900
open your browser and like do everything.

668
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,580
Like you don't have to even leave your browser.

669
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,580
It's super amazing.

670
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:13,540
I don't know if you know about the browser company, they make this browser called Arc.

671
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,540
It's pretty new.

672
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:21,460
It's pretty new and it's based on Chromium, but the experience is completely different.

673
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,220
Like they're re-envisioning what a browser can be.

674
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,320
And I actually had a talk from the CEO the other day about some of the dreams they have

675
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:33,740
for Arc and he sees this is essentially this future where what he calls internet machines

676
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,300
are going to become the thing.

677
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,340
And it's very Chromebook-y in nature.

678
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:45,520
It's this idea that Arc can be not just your browser, but it's your computer.

679
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,340
Because if so many things that you think is application is actually just a web app that's

680
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:56,300
running in Electron or something like that, where it's in the end of the day, it's actually

681
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,260
just a browser.

682
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:05,980
And so the idea is that Arc will open up those possibilities and make it like this thing

683
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,380
that you just open up and you're like, okay, cool.

684
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,620
Open up Arc and the rest of the day you're just marked.

685
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,580
And like GitHub has done so much to do this, like getting around GitHub with their command

686
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,580
palette.

687
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,540
You just need command key on a Mac and it pops open and you're just like, okay, I want

688
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,940
to go to this repo, boop, boop, I want to go to that one, command key.

689
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:23,940
You don't even have to click.

690
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,660
You can just use the keyboard to get around.

691
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,900
You can move files, you can rename files.

692
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,780
And then if you really want to do some intricate work, you just open a code space.

693
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,340
Now you've got the entire VS code running in your browser with all it's synced with

694
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,260
your local VS code so it brings in all your extensions and everything's there.

695
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,500
And then you have services like Railway you talked about where you can just say, okay,

696
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,900
cool, Railway, take all the stuff I just did and deploy it all, database and all.

697
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,900
It's amazing.

698
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,140
It is, and you know, there's another one similar to the code spaces.

699
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,420
I don't know if you've heard of Gitpod, have you heard of them?

700
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,420
I've heard about it.

701
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,420
Yeah.

702
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,420
Somebody mentioned it to me.

703
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,420
I'm still alive.

704
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,420
Look at that.

705
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,420
Yeah.

706
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,900
So it's the same idea as code spaces, but the entire platform, that's all they do is

707
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,580
basically just do code spaces.

708
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:22,100
But I've used both when I was setting up during that sort of blog post process, it literally

709
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:29,060
like runs up a full, a full setup for you, including your in web browser in like, I don't

710
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,860
know, it was like 20 seconds.

711
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,720
It was ridiculously fast.

712
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,620
And I was like, I don't know how you're doing this, especially when you're, this is free

713
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:41,020
for a lot of the time, but also it's just so incredible.

714
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:45,620
And it's funny because I've moved, I purchased a secondary device, it was a Chromebook and

715
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:50,200
I've tried to set up local device or set up things on my local device and like use the

716
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,420
backend sort of like Linux environment that it gives you.

717
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,740
And yeah, I like, I ended up like, you run into so many issues that you're like, can

718
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,620
I do this in the browser?

719
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,580
And you can, and it's so much easier.

720
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:04,100
You don't need to worry about where, where were your most recent commits if you didn't

721
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,260
actually push it up to the, push it up to where you should have pushed it up at the

722
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,700
time.

723
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,940
It's just all there for you.

724
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:17,180
And I think that's actually, that's a big, for new web developers, folks that are getting

725
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,540
into the space, I think that's a game changer.

726
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:27,700
This whole browser based setup, I have a, I have a colleague, I have a colleague that

727
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,660
has been a software developer for years.

728
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,340
And they, they said to me recently, you know, one of the biggest things that I do with folks

729
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:40,060
that are getting involved in sort of a technology role, or they want to get in there is I will

730
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,220
sit down with them for two to three hours and I will just like spend all that time to

731
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,300
get them set up with the perfect development environment.

732
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,900
Because if they have a terrible experience with getting their dev environment set up,

733
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,740
they're going to walk away.

734
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:59,740
And so making that process and getting rid of the, the, the, the barriers that exist

735
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,500
there, I think is a huge game changer.

736
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Yeah.

737
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm finding with the people that I have in the community, I'm finding that people on

738
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,140
windows machines are especially struggling with this.

739
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:18,220
I mean, kudos to Microsoft for adding like windows subsystem for Linux and making that

740
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,380
be more and more seamless.

741
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,300
But even with that, it's still really hard.

742
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:30,180
Like if you're not on a Mac or if you're not on Linux, Linux is still tricky, but much,

743
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,500
much easier than windows.

744
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,660
That's oftentimes what you end up doing most of your day is fighting with your tools.

745
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,160
And that's the last thing you want to do.

746
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,420
Even as a professional being in the industry for 10 years, 15 years, the last thing you

747
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,620
want to do is wake up and fight with your tools.

748
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,940
You want to solve problems.

749
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,900
You want to be, you know, productive.

750
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,420
You don't want to like, ah, I just can't do this thing because VS code is being weird

751
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,060
or because for some reason, like MongoDB has just disappeared.

752
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,480
Like suddenly I don't have MongoDB anymore.

753
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,340
So I think these in browser things that also gives you this ability to create like these

754
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,020
dev containers, like you can do in code spaces where basically you open it up and it's like,

755
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,700
I'm just going to get everything ready for you because the creator of this code space

756
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,820
has already told me what you will need.

757
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,700
So I'm going to download all these extensions.

758
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,860
I'm going to do all these configurations and you just open a file and start writing code.

759
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,940
I think it's, it's definitely like you say, it's, it's a complete game changer.

760
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,940
It's funny.

761
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,660
So for the, for, for anybody that that's out there that is on windows, I'm a windows developer.

762
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,660
I do it there.

763
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:33,820
I struggled for years with this same thing.

764
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:40,620
I found this brilliant piece of software, open source software again called Laragon.

765
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:47,800
And so this is a kind of like a watered down or maybe not watered down based on my understanding

766
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,260
of like a local Docker instance, but it's not that it's just an app that runs the web

767
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,260
server.

768
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:59,900
It's like a lamp or like WAMP, like those old, those old systems that you had set up,

769
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,940
but but it's much more modern.

770
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:08,660
You can, with the click of a button, you can install anything that you want to, even to

771
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:14,140
the point of like publishing or, or getting your app up on ngrok, whereas normally you'd

772
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:16,060
have to go through a bunch of steps in the command line.

773
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,940
It's literally just like you right click on the app and then click deploy to the internet

774
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:25,660
and then it'll just like spin up an ngrok URL for you that you're able to use.

775
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,940
Just like it was a game changer for me when I discovered it.

776
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,500
Oh, that's brilliant.

777
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,300
Yeah, I'm definitely going to share that like with everybody.

778
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,340
It almost feels like it's almost like, I don't know if you know set up, set up is this thing

779
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:44,780
you get on, on Macs where you pay like $10 a month and then it's got all like these applications

780
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,060
that solves all these little problems for you.

781
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,140
It's often like indie developers and they've created like this little app that does this

782
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,460
one thing really, really well.

783
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,060
But there's also like big apps on there that you wouldn't even expect to be on there seeing

784
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:01,740
that you only have $10 a month, but it almost feels like a set up, but for developers.

785
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,260
And I think that would actually be super awesome if somebody can create something like that.

786
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:11,180
That's cross platform where you literally say, well, I need a server that can run PHP.

787
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,100
I need a MySQL database and I need a VS code thing and I need that.

788
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,100
And it just goes cool.

789
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,940
Here I go and there's everything for you.

790
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,740
That would be amazing.

791
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,660
So there's project ideas.

792
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,660
I love that.

793
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,660
Yeah, yeah.

794
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,700
I mean, I totally feel the pain of all those Windows developers out there.

795
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:35,860
And yeah, well, you're talking about having these, again, going back to the browser piece.

796
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:42,100
Say what you want about folks that are not able to set up a local development environment

797
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:48,420
and that may cause challenges for them later on in their career, but especially for early

798
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,700
stage folks that are really just needing to get into the code and not fight and not know

799
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,260
how to troubleshoot these things.

800
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:02,340
I think there's going to be a big shift in certainly for junior devs especially.

801
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:06,940
Yeah, I completely agree with that.

802
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,100
So I want to cycle back into something different that's very, very different to what we've

803
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,260
been talking about, but I think it's something to touch on.

804
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,620
Seeing that you are kind of, and it's interesting because you're kind of like both sides of

805
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,620
the coin.

806
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:23,140
You've been involved with education, but you're also like a web developer still learning the

807
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:28,980
craft and going through interviews and all that kind of good stuff.

808
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,380
What are your thoughts around interviews, especially related to the tech industry?

809
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:37,780
I think interviews are generally a challenging thing no matter what the industry, but I want

810
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,140
us to kind of focus in on the tech industry.

811
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,500
Do you have any thoughts around this topic?

812
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,380
I know it's a bit of a hard topic, but anything you want to say?

813
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:50,820
Yeah, so I mean, I guess I come to this from an interesting angle just because even the

814
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:57,060
position that I have with Battlesnake, it wasn't necessarily an interview per se in

815
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,660
the traditional way.

816
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:04,100
So the interview that I actually had that kind of got me in there, and I think there's

817
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:10,420
probably some piece of that that people can take away, was the work that I did with HiTechU.

818
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:16,460
So the founder of Battlesnake, which is the company that I work for now, when we were

819
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,900
first building up the program, we went and met with I think 30 different tech companies

820
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,820
and said, hey, we've got this idea, what do you think about this?

821
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,060
And it was generally just a fact-finding mission.

822
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,780
And we went and met with this one company and they said, we love this idea, it's fantastic.

823
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,260
How much money do you need to make it successful?

824
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:37,620
And we threw out a number that was way too small and he said, add another zero and we'll

825
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,520
make that happen.

826
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,180
And so through that process, it was a lot of sort of them being really involved and

827
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:47,520
seeing how I worked and the things that I was able to accomplish and to get an idea

828
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,060
of who I was as sort of a worker and just a person.

829
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,340
And then when the opportunity came that this position became open, it was sort of more

830
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,060
of a conversation.

831
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:02,100
So I think while this doesn't tie necessarily directly into the interview, one of the things

832
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:07,860
that I will say is you never know where a job is going to come from, and you never know

833
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,660
what is actually an interview that you don't realize.

834
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:19,260
So anytime you're interacting with somebody in the technology industry, I would say from

835
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,860
step one, from that cold email that you're sending them to the coffee that you're having

836
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:28,300
with them, all of that is an interview process.

837
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:33,060
And as somebody who has hired a lot of people that are in the technology space, I will also

838
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,520
say, interviewing sucks for the interviewer.

839
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:44,900
Interviewing is time consuming, interviewing is stressful, interviewing is oftentimes just

840
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,960
not an area of focus for people.

841
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,000
So employers really want you to be successful.

842
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,580
They're not going into it like, despite the old view of sort of three people sitting on

843
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:01,220
a panel across from you and them sort of challenging you to show that you're worth there.

844
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,540
They want you to be successful.

845
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,300
By the time you get into the interview, they already like you.

846
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,500
It's your job just to sort of show them why and to demonstrate that.

847
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,740
Yeah, does that kind of answer that question?

848
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,740
Yeah, yeah.

849
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:21,620
And I spoke to somebody during the week for a different recording, a different episode,

850
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:26,220
and they said an interesting thing, which I kind of knew, but I forgot about the fact

851
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,220
that that is actually the most important thing.

852
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,820
The most important thing almost when you're in an interview is, yeah, sure, your tech

853
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,940
skills is important.

854
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,460
And some companies focus too heavily on that, especially when they have like all these crazy

855
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:43,980
algorithms and stuff like that and the dreaded whiteboard challenges.

856
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:48,460
But companies that take a different approach to this, a more healthier approach, generally

857
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:53,340
what they want to understand is what value do you bring to the company?

858
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,360
And that is what you have to focus on.

859
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,500
If they hire you, how will it make their company better?

860
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,460
I think that is what they really want, right?

861
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,460
Like sure, they know they need another developer because there's a lot of work to do, but what

862
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,700
is the value you bring?

863
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,140
Is there like something in your background that's really unique?

864
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,380
Do you have a unique perspective on the thing?

865
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:20,640
And I think researching the company and therefore not just doing the thing where you just send

866
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,500
out resumes to 200 companies and hoping somebody comes back to you, I think you have to instead

867
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,400
like really go and do some research about companies that you would be interested in

868
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:35,780
working for and find out what they're talking about, what they're blogging about.

869
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:39,020
And if you have a unique idea, this is the time to bring it up.

870
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,020
It's in that interview.

871
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,620
Like, so I read this thing that you wrote and I really liked the idea, but I was thinking

872
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,060
and I think blah, blah, blah.

873
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,780
I think that is the conversations that's going to get you in the door more than just your

874
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,020
technical skills by itself.

875
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,460
Absolutely.

876
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,980
I would say like it's always that last question that is asked by every interviewer everywhere

877
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:04,500
in the world, which is, do you have any questions for us, which is actually like the one that's

878
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:10,220
going to like land you in that job or could just be a thing that you miss out on?

879
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:14,860
It's such a huge opportunity, especially if you're going in and your questions are only

880
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:24,860
around what's the salary like or like what's the like some very low level or just surface

881
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,860
level piece.

882
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,380
You're actually digging in and being like, so yeah, I saw this post and like, how did

883
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,460
you decide that that was the way that you were going to pursue?

884
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,260
Like opening the conversation, right?

885
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,740
It shows that you're interested in what they're doing.

886
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,820
I couldn't agree more.

887
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:43,540
I think there's huge power in a question that seems like it's just a filler.

888
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,780
Yeah, for sure.

889
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:49,820
I think that's super important and I think people have the wrong perception of that question.

890
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,160
That question isn't just asked.

891
00:57:53,160 --> 00:58:00,700
I think that question is asked deliberately to see if you have the confidence to ask questions

892
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,780
because I think a lot of people are like, oh, I don't want to waste their time.

893
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,700
No, people actually want you.

894
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,700
That's critical.

895
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:14,380
I know I've interviewed people for positions and I've almost always had a much better feeling

896
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:24,540
about candidates that had insightful questions and not about how much money or working hours,

897
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:28,020
but more stuff about the culture of the company.

898
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,740
How do you work together as a team?

899
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:35,380
What are the goals for the company in the next six months?

900
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:41,100
And then when you tell them the things you can about all these things to have follow-ups,

901
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:47,260
to actually actively listen and then have follow-up questions in the moment.

902
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,420
What we're talking now, a lot of this is not rehearsed.

903
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,500
I say a thing, you teal from that, I teal from that.

904
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:00,920
I think that is what really gets you in because that creates a human connection with the interviewer.

905
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,900
So it becomes less of an interviewer-interviewee and it becomes a conversation between two

906
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,580
people that just want to make the company succeed.

907
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,380
I think that is something that people forget.

908
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,380
Absolutely.

909
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:13,380
Right?

910
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:16,060
I mean, at the end of the day, people that are interviewing, they're interviewing to

911
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,100
see if you're a good fit with the team.

912
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,860
While that causes, I think, some challenges because in a lot of cases, that means that

913
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:28,500
you end up hiring a lot of people that look the same or think the same way.

914
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,820
Going into it, recognizing that really people are wanting to know who you are as a person

915
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,720
and not necessarily the things that you've done in the past.

916
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,500
It's more about who you are and traits, right?

917
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:44,620
I think, I mean, we talked about problem solving, but things like coachability and teachability

918
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:56,060
and passion for curiosity, if somebody sparks within their conversation that they love learning,

919
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:00,180
that is more powerful to me than if they can solve the most complex problem because there

920
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,660
will always be a more complex problem.

921
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:09,460
If you're only worried about being able to demonstrate you can solve it, that's only

922
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,940
going to get you so far.

923
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,940
Yeah.

924
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,940
That's for sure.

925
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,940
That's for sure.

926
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:14,940
Yeah.

927
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:15,940
I agree.

928
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:19,100
I think we're an hour in.

929
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,100
Wow.

930
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,100
I can't believe it.

931
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:27,100
I think I just have maybe one or two more things and then if you have anything also.

932
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:33,980
Talking about when you're not making awesome battle snakes or writing blog posts, what

933
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:38,260
are the things that interest you in this world outside of maybe even outside of tech?

934
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:42,380
I know for a lot of people when you ask that question, they're like, I still do tech stuff

935
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,700
for my free time.

936
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,700
And that's totally fine.

937
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,580
What do you like to do when you're not on the job?

938
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,060
Yeah.

939
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,260
So I'm kind of there.

940
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,580
I'm trying to get away from it.

941
01:00:52,580 --> 01:01:00,180
So I guess I've come to the tech industry through a lot of like windy, wavy processes

942
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,180
and experiences.

943
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:07,340
So what's interesting is I really only within the past sort of I would say five years have

944
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,340
I really been in the technology space.

945
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:16,460
So much of my time up until then was the thing I would do in my spare time was tech stuff.

946
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,600
And now I'm kind of getting paid for doing tech related things.

947
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,760
And so I still do tech stuff in my spare time.

948
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,420
But thankfully, my lovely wife is definitely not that person.

949
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:32,660
She is definitely the outdoor person who enjoys like experience in the world where we live

950
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:38,700
in British Columbia and on Vancouver Island specifically is absolutely gorgeous.

951
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,580
So we are one of the things that's a big thing for us is hiking.

952
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:48,340
So we hike and I say this and may regret it, but we hike religiously.

953
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,140
And it's just because it happens on Sundays.

954
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,140
We do it every Sunday.

955
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,140
We'll drive.

956
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,420
We'll hike for a couple of hours.

957
01:01:54,420 --> 01:02:00,460
And it's such a getting back to like grounding yourself on a weekly basis, especially when

958
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:05,640
you're sitting and staring at a computer screen for many, many hours a day is such a such a

959
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,640
powerful thing.

960
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,540
And then, yeah, right.

961
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,540
And like, what about you?

962
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,540
What about you?

963
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:16,340
What do you do in the non in the non tech related time shelf?

964
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:21,300
Pretty much a lot of the same, to be honest, we don't have a ton of hiking things we used

965
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,220
to do it and then we kind of like fellow with COVID and stuff like that.

966
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:27,420
We kind of like lost that but we're trying to get back.

967
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,220
The problem is we have pets that we'd like to take on a hike.

968
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:34,220
And in South Africa, it's kind of hard to find places that's bed friendly, like if you

969
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:36,820
have a dog that you want to take with stuff like that.

970
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:42,220
So we're currently like actually researching and trying to find places that is dog friendly

971
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,240
because we do enjoy that as a family.

972
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,460
So that's something that we'd like to do again.

973
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:49,060
But we have a golf course close to us.

974
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,800
And they kind of have a walking path there.

975
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,840
And that's dog friendly.

976
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,920
So that's something that we do like in the week, like maybe you just feel like I need

977
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,420
an hour's break and just the kids we take the dogs and we just could take a walk.

978
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,840
And it's it's it's amazing what it does to your mental health.

979
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,820
Just taking that break.

980
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:06,820
Absolutely.

981
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:07,820
Yeah.

982
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:13,520
And then I guess the other the other thing that the tech the tech fun thing that I do.

983
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:19,340
So so when I was going through teachers college and I did my master's in education as well,

984
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:24,380
and it was specifically focused on sort of like alternative educational assessment of

985
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:28,660
sort of like reimagining what the report card is and how it can help learners.

986
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:32,820
And so when I initially developed it, it was sort of a it was like a form.

987
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,620
It was like a rubric.

988
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:39,500
And then I built as part of my my thesis, I ended up building sort of a Google Google

989
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,940
Apps app, like basically using the Google Sheets and just sort of building a pseudo

990
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:46,220
database in the background.

991
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:50,100
And then when I was done, I went and pitched it to the school that I'd been working with.

992
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,860
And they said, could it have this function?

993
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,540
Could you turn it into a web app?

994
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:58,100
And that was a dangerous thing to say, because while I said no, initially, then I was like,

995
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,100
could I?

996
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,580
I don't know how to do this, but could I?

997
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:07,140
And and and now like a year later, I'm still actively working on it, like in every spare

998
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,900
moment that I have.

999
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,540
I have that exact same problem.

1000
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:16,180
I constantly maybe I start working at one thing and then I'm like, what if I can do

1001
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,180
that?

1002
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,180
I can't.

1003
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:19,180
Oh, cool.

1004
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:22,020
And then, oh, but if I can do that, I wonder if I can do that.

1005
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:25,540
And before you know it, it's like three hours later.

1006
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:29,620
And there's like, thing that maybe was at one purpose can now do all these different

1007
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,620
things.

1008
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:36,620
And I think that is just that's just the natural curiosity that that is part of the industry.

1009
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,620
I so agree.

1010
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,060
I feel like that I was talking to somebody yesterday who's a professional software developer

1011
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:45,220
and they were saying the same thing of like, you can do anything like what?

1012
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,540
That's the very cool thing about tech is almost anything you can imagine you can do.

1013
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:53,340
The question is, should you should you do it?

1014
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:56,260
But also, like being able to like time box yourself, right?

1015
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,780
Put yourself in this time period.

1016
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:01,460
But yeah, like this app, this app started out very simple.

1017
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:05,040
And then as I learn, as you learn more and you discover the features and you actually

1018
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:08,540
start to understand how things work, you're like, OK, I can do this.

1019
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,300
But you're just like you said, it's like you're like, I'm going to do this in a half an hour.

1020
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,300
Four hours later, as you're like sweating because your problem solving is like not getting

1021
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,100
you to the place you need to go.

1022
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:24,780
Again, I'm very glad I have a non sort of tech wife like my partner is just like enjoys

1023
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,820
can use computers very well, but is not the developer.

1024
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:29,140
And she's like, you need to walk away from this.

1025
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,480
You need to go.

1026
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,480
And we need to go for that.

1027
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,380
Like, no, for sure, that's super important to have that balance.

1028
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:39,780
It's good if you have somebody that can like literally drag you away from the left and

1029
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,780
say, that's enough now.

1030
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,000
It's brilliant.

1031
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,700
So in closing, is there anything else you'd like to share with us?

1032
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:51,420
Any like putting words, words of wisdom, anything that you'd like to share?

1033
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:58,620
Yeah, so I think my my only words of wisdom that I can provide and this comes from experience

1034
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:06,780
and from talking to a lot of people, be curious, be focused on learning and growing a growth

1035
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:12,980
mindset will bring you farther in not only the technology industry, but any industry.

1036
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:17,820
It's going to make you a massively valuable asset that keeps growing.

1037
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:22,620
And it's going to help you to discover things that you didn't even know about yourself.

1038
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:27,020
And in terms of that growth mindset, don't just let it be about things that you can do.

1039
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:31,180
Let it be about internal growth as well and discovering who you are and things that you

1040
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,820
enjoy.

1041
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:36,820
Technology is spectacular, and it can help you do a lot of things for others.

1042
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:42,620
But really take time to focus on yourself and discover, learn more about yourself and

1043
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:43,780
take time there as well.

1044
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,620
So grow outwards and also grow inwards.

1045
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,140
That is super valuable advice.

1046
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,140
Thanks for sharing that.

1047
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,780
Well, thank you, Andrew.

1048
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,460
This was this was really great.

1049
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:58,260
I mean, it's been added for over an hour and it surely doesn't feel like it.

1050
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:02,700
Thanks so much for taking time on your Friday to speak with me and share all this wonderful

1051
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,100
information with our community.

this is exactly what the world needs right now, making technology accessible for everybody.

1058
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,940
And so thank you so much for having me.

1059
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,020
I cannot tell you how much I appreciate it.

1065
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,020
