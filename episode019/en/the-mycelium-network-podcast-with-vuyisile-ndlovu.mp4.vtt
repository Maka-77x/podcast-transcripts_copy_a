Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.560 --> 00:09.280
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.760
Hey, Buisile, thanks so much for joining me for the Mycelium Network Podcast.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.160
The pleasure is mine. I'm happy to be here.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.360
How's yours? How's your day been so far?

00:22.800 --> 00:26.240
It's been a good day. It's been a good day. It's raining here in Zimbabwe,

00:26.240 --> 00:30.160
so you're always welcome. Yeah, that's very true. That's very true.

00:30.880 --> 00:38.000
So, I think let's just get this conversation right off to a start.

00:39.200 --> 00:46.480
So, I know you from way back in the day when we met at a Mozilla event, I believe it was.

00:46.480 --> 00:52.560
I think it might even have been something to do with Firefox OS still back in the day.

00:52.560 --> 00:58.720
Yeah, that was in Johannesburg. That is correct. That is correct.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.760
And after that, I've been following you on Twitter and I've been seeing the conversations

01:03.760 --> 01:09.680
you've been having and all the things you've been up to. And when I started this whole community

01:09.680 --> 01:15.680
and I started the podcast, I've always meant to invite you. So, I'm glad that I finally did

01:15.680 --> 01:20.080
and that you were available and that we can have this conversation. Because I do think that you

01:20.080 --> 01:25.600
have an interesting perspective and that you have a good story to tell and I would love to

01:26.240 --> 01:34.720
give you a voice. So, to get us started, tell us more about who you are, how you got into

01:34.720 --> 01:41.760
development, where did you grow up, anything that in your early years that might have been a catalyst

01:41.760 --> 01:49.760
to kickstart your career, kickstart your interest in tech. And then just as an aside at some point,

01:49.760 --> 01:54.160
I'm always curious when people have like a pseudonym on the internet what the story

01:54.160 --> 01:59.840
behind it is. And like on Github and Twitter, you have this pseudonym called Terra Maiar,

01:59.840 --> 02:03.120
if I'm pronouncing it correctly. So, I'm curious if there's a story behind that.

02:04.640 --> 02:14.160
Okay. All right. That's okay. Let me tell my story. So, I was raised in Zimbabwe.

02:14.160 --> 02:26.160
I've always loved tech and computers. I've always been intrigued by how they work. I'd say I'm a

02:26.160 --> 02:37.120
logical person, I think in a bullet point kind of way, like a very sequential way. Computers

02:37.120 --> 02:44.960
work the same. So, I just understood them. And so, I've always loved computers. And I used to

02:44.960 --> 02:50.000
go to my sister's workplace just to play with her computer back in the day. We didn't have a

02:50.000 --> 02:54.720
computer. I didn't have a personal computer at home. So, the only computers I came across were

02:54.720 --> 03:01.440
computers in people's workplaces. I would always visit friends and family's offices just to use

03:01.440 --> 03:08.080
their computer. That's how I got to learn how to use a computer. And then, once I knew enough,

03:08.080 --> 03:13.680
I started going to internet cafes, messing around on the internet, you know, started joining forums

03:13.680 --> 03:21.840
and chat groups and things like that. And so, that's how my interest in computers was what it

03:21.840 --> 03:27.920
peaked at that point, I'd say. And then after high school, I went to a polytechnic college,

03:27.920 --> 03:37.200
I studied IT. So, I learned formally about computers and information technology. Unfortunately,

03:37.200 --> 03:45.920
I wasn't able to graduate because of financial problems and some other personal reasons that

03:45.920 --> 03:53.600
kept me from completing that course. But I still loved it. And I still carry that knowledge I gained

03:53.600 --> 04:02.720
from them with me. So, after I finished or after college was done, I started contributing to open

04:02.720 --> 04:08.240
source. That's when I started. I found Mozilla. I joined Mozilla community at first. I was just

04:08.240 --> 04:15.280
doing translation. I worked on Firefox OS translation into Hindi, the language I speak here.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.920
And then from there, as I met more people, I got more and more involved in the community,

04:21.920 --> 04:29.920
and then contributed to QA. We used to do QA testing for pre-release Firefox builds and even

04:29.920 --> 04:39.040
Firefox OS at some point. And then that was when I was introduced to programming because a lot of

04:39.040 --> 04:46.800
the QA engineers at Mozilla used Python to automate the tests that they used to against the Firefox

04:46.800 --> 04:52.720
or many of the internal Mozilla websites they were testing. So, that's when I was introduced to Python

04:52.720 --> 05:00.960
and got interested, and I started learning it. So, I started learning. That was around 2013,

05:00.960 --> 05:07.680
2014, I think. And yeah, that's when my Python journey started. And then after that,

05:09.760 --> 05:16.240
after a few years, I learned Python. I watched some YouTube tutorials. I read some books. I

05:16.240 --> 05:22.240
bought some courses, and I got good at it. But unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a job

05:22.880 --> 05:28.080
because something the tech pros on YouTube don't tell you is when you're learning a

05:28.720 --> 05:32.640
tool or programming language, you need to learn something that makes sense for where you are.

05:33.200 --> 05:40.320
And there isn't a big market for Python here in Zimbabwe, so I learned that the hard way.

05:40.320 --> 05:46.720
But yeah, after a while, I eventually found remote jobs. And that's how I got into

05:46.720 --> 05:52.640
software development using Python. Okay. That's interesting. That is an interesting perspective

05:52.640 --> 05:58.720
to think about not only which language, but which language is in demand where you live.

06:00.640 --> 06:09.120
I guess that's to some extent true in South Africa as well. I don't know now. I've not been

06:09.120 --> 06:15.840
super in touch with the workforce in South Africa for quite some time. But I know when I started,

06:15.840 --> 06:21.200
Java was definitely the language du jour. If you wanted a job, you had to know Java.

06:24.640 --> 06:29.200
That's why I always say I have a love-hate relationship with Java because I never

06:30.160 --> 06:36.480
enjoyed the language. But I am grateful for the opportunities that it given me because it

06:36.480 --> 06:44.880
introduced me to open source and it allowed me to get a job, a decent paying job, which allowed me

06:44.880 --> 06:56.240
to explore some other avenues. But I definitely quickly discovered that for me, that wasn't the

06:56.240 --> 07:03.120
language and especially not J2EE. The enterprise stuff was definitely not where my love and interest

07:03.120 --> 07:13.360
lie. But I'm grateful for what it introduced me to. So is there a story behind TerraMajor

07:13.360 --> 07:19.920
or is it just something you picked? Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention. So when I was

07:19.920 --> 07:25.920
fooling around on the internet, I wanted to have a pseudonym I could use across all my socials.

07:25.920 --> 07:32.640
Right. And the name is a pretty common name here in Africa. So most of the time when I try to use

07:32.640 --> 07:38.720
the name, it'll be taken. So I had to come up with something unique, but that also spoke to the kind

07:38.720 --> 07:47.600
of person I was. So TerraMajor is an acronym. I'd say it describes me in a sense. It stands for

07:47.600 --> 07:55.520
Tremendously Exuberant, Risen, and Real Attitude. That's a terra. I think that's what I am,

07:55.520 --> 08:02.800
I'd like to say. And then major is just like a major, like a title from an army.

08:02.800 --> 08:06.720
Oh, okay. Someone who has that attitude and who's also a major. And I just felt it different

08:06.720 --> 08:15.360
weirdly so that I would always be unique. That's very interesting. So I did that with us as young,

08:15.360 --> 08:21.680
just straight out of college. And the name stuck. Unfortunately, I've built my brand, so to speak,

08:21.680 --> 08:26.880
quote unquote, around that name. So I haven't really changed it. So you'll find most of my socials,

08:26.880 --> 08:31.120
I'm TerraMajor on most of my socials. It's like GitHub, Twitter, everywhere.

08:32.560 --> 08:37.840
That's very interesting. Yeah. I always like hearing the stories behind the names. So as you

08:37.840 --> 08:45.520
mentioned, even though Python wasn't the language that you needed in Zimbabwe to get a job, it's

08:45.520 --> 08:52.480
still a language that you learned. And I know that you love Python. That's what I can tell from

08:53.120 --> 09:00.240
your tweets and all this stuff you do. And I have to say, if I had to pick a backend language,

09:00.240 --> 09:07.520
other than Node, i.e. JavaScript, I would probably pick Python as well. I really love the syntax.

09:07.520 --> 09:17.280
I really like the rules of Python. Are you thinking Python? It resonates with me very much.

09:17.280 --> 09:25.360
But you, as somebody who uses Python as your main language, what is it about Python that attracted

09:25.360 --> 09:32.720
you and what do you love about Python? Okay. So like I mentioned, firstly, I learned Python

09:32.720 --> 09:38.240
because that's what all the cool engineers at Mozilla used. That's what first got me into Python.

09:38.240 --> 09:46.000
But then as I learned, it was really easy for me to learn. Unlike languages like C++ or Java,

09:46.800 --> 09:52.720
it read like English. It's very straightforward. You can pick up a Python program and figure out

09:52.720 --> 09:58.560
what it does, even when you're not very experienced with programming. So that was what got me

09:58.560 --> 10:05.360
interested in Python. But really what made me love the language as much as I do is the community.

10:05.360 --> 10:13.840
It is a fantastic community. And as someone who was finding their way, I was on my own. I didn't

10:13.840 --> 10:19.360
have a college degree. I didn't have a lot of support here. So I had to lean on the Python

10:19.360 --> 10:25.520
community to basically get mentorship, get opportunities. And the community was fantastic.

10:26.560 --> 10:33.360
Very friendly people, very helpful, and very accommodating. So that's what really

10:34.320 --> 10:42.080
made me like the language as much as I do. But another thing is, it's a bit of, it's really

10:42.080 --> 10:49.440
sentimental. Because I learned Python, and then I couldn't get a job. So I had to make a choice.

10:49.440 --> 10:55.200
Because either I pick up a language like Java, or one of the.NET languages that are common here,

10:56.000 --> 11:02.560
even wanted to get a job, or I could just stick it out and not give up and just keep pushing

11:02.560 --> 11:07.440
until I got the job. Because I already put in the time to learn this language. So that's what I did.

11:07.440 --> 11:13.280
I chose the second option. You know what? You have already put in this work. Just see it through.

11:13.280 --> 11:20.560
So I went through a very difficult phase where I forced myself to learn enough Python to get a job.

11:20.560 --> 11:26.400
That was my goal. I was like, you know what? Just get a job that way you can use Python, and then

11:26.400 --> 11:31.840
that way I won't feel like a failure for learning it. And so it's one of those things where I just

11:31.840 --> 11:37.360
had to stick through with it. I had to learn the language. I had to learn the language.

11:37.360 --> 11:48.160
I had to make it work. So I did that. I got the job. And now I'm actually trying to move away from

11:48.160 --> 11:54.640
Python and learn different languages. I don't want to be the Python guy. I just want to be able to

11:54.640 --> 12:00.720
code in Python and other languages. Is there any other language specifically that you're thinking

12:00.720 --> 12:11.680
about? Go and Rust on my radar. Yeah, those are good ones. I always mean to learn Rust, but

12:12.960 --> 12:16.960
JavaScript evolves so fast that I'm finding it hard enough to keep up with JavaScript.

12:18.480 --> 12:24.560
Exactly. But I'm just like, oh, my goodness, what's this new thing in JavaScript today? Okay,

12:24.560 --> 12:29.680
wait, let me just figure this one out first before I try a new language. But at some point,

12:29.680 --> 12:34.640
I'd like to learn Rust because I think some of the backend stuff that I'm doing,

12:37.680 --> 12:43.600
especially the one side project I'm working on, if that kicks off and is successful,

12:43.600 --> 12:49.040
I think it would be beneficial if I have the backend written in Rust as opposed to in Node.

12:49.680 --> 12:56.560
I think Rust will allow me to scale much, much better than doing Node. Because with Rust,

12:56.560 --> 13:01.520
if I understand correctly, I'm going to be much closer to the metal instead of having to go

13:01.520 --> 13:06.560
through a translation layer that then speaks to the metal, which is always a good thing if you

13:06.560 --> 13:15.120
want to eke out that extra bit of performance. That's basically how I learn. I put myself in a

13:15.120 --> 13:19.360
situation where I'm like, okay, I'm going to do this project and I'm going to do it in Rust,

13:19.360 --> 13:27.520
and now I have no choice. I have to learn it. I don't know. That's just how I learn. So,

13:29.360 --> 13:34.560
I have to think which area I want to go into. Let's dig into community a little bit.

13:37.920 --> 13:44.080
Among the many things I do is, well, I've started this community called Mercedes Network,

13:44.080 --> 13:54.320
but I'm also the community manager for MDN Web Docs at Mozilla. So, I'm more and more involved

13:54.320 --> 14:01.920
in everything community. One of the reasons for it is, like you said, I think it's often

14:03.520 --> 14:10.960
the differentiator and the enabler for a lot of people where you don't feel alone.

14:10.960 --> 14:16.800
Because I think oftentimes it's not easy to give up, but you're more likely to give up if

14:16.800 --> 14:23.440
you don't have a community that either holds you accountable or simply inspires you or both.

14:24.480 --> 14:32.400
So, what are your feelings? That's how I think about community. What is important to you

14:32.400 --> 14:43.040
about community? Well, it's two things really. Sharing of skills and opportunities. When you're

14:43.040 --> 14:47.280
learning on your own, when you're self-taught, or when you're just figuring stuff out from doing a

14:47.280 --> 14:55.200
bunch of tutorials online, you really don't know what you don't know. It's beneficial to be part

14:55.200 --> 14:59.840
of a community with people who are more experienced than you because they can help you see the things

14:59.840 --> 15:05.280
or figure out the things you're supposed to know that you're not aware that you don't know.

15:06.240 --> 15:12.720
So, that helps a lot. And it helps also, like you mentioned, to see people doing the stuff you want

15:12.720 --> 15:19.360
to do in the real world and actually making an impact using the stuff you're learning. So,

15:19.360 --> 15:24.720
it gives you the motivation to work towards a goal to be like them. Like I mentioned, I learned

15:24.720 --> 15:29.920
Python because the cool engineers at Mozilla were using it and it looked cool and I liked that.

15:29.920 --> 15:35.120
I wanted to be like them and then that's what got me involved. And then along the way, as I was

15:35.120 --> 15:42.720
learning, I had people in the community I could reach out to for help when I needed it. And these

15:42.720 --> 15:49.120
are people who are leaders in respecting different fields. So, I knew I was always getting the right

15:49.120 --> 15:55.760
kind of guidance and the right kind of information. And it helped to have that. Unlike where you just

15:55.760 --> 16:00.320
have to Google like on Stack Overflow or something, it helped to have that human connection.

16:01.840 --> 16:10.160
Yeah, for sure. I totally agree. So, then on a slightly related but tougher topic,

16:11.040 --> 16:18.960
I'd just like to get your input. So, I recently learned that of all contributions to open source,

16:18.960 --> 16:26.000
only 17% comes from Africa. That blew my mind because that's a very, very small number

16:26.560 --> 16:36.320
if you take into account how many people are on this continent. So, my one question is,

16:37.600 --> 16:47.760
why do you think are holding people back from it? And then what role can open source play

16:47.760 --> 16:52.800
in lifting people up and creating opportunity? Because I strongly believe open source has

16:52.800 --> 17:00.720
tremendous possibility to open up doors for people. And I think you've experienced it through

17:00.720 --> 17:05.520
the whole Mozilla thing and you mentioned getting into open source early. So, what are your thoughts

17:05.520 --> 17:10.880
on those topics? Why do you think there's such a small number of people contributing to open

17:10.880 --> 17:18.560
source? And what can we do about that? Man, this one is a tricky one because I think

17:20.080 --> 17:30.960
it's to do with lack of access. So, I'd say there's poorly developed infrastructure

17:30.960 --> 17:39.520
that plays a role. Lack of skills to effectively contribute to some open source project. And

17:39.520 --> 17:45.680
I guess this also falls under infrastructure is that internet access is not widely distributed,

17:45.680 --> 17:54.720
I mean, evenly distributed in Africa. So, you'll find that in landlocked countries, generally,

17:54.720 --> 18:00.160
the internet tends to be slower because they don't have a lot of inland fiber connections. So,

18:01.360 --> 18:08.480
because it's slower, they use technologies like satellite, UHF and whatnot. These are

18:08.480 --> 18:15.440
slow and expensive. So, internet access for the most part is not... A lot of people have access to

18:15.440 --> 18:21.600
high speed internet and if they do have it, it's expensive. That's the first problem. In most of

18:21.600 --> 18:29.120
Africa, there is, of course, the power of problems and a lot of infrastructure problems. Then that

18:29.120 --> 18:36.800
aside, I think the second reason why we don't have a lot of contributions in open source is

18:36.800 --> 18:45.120
time. I'd say one has to be privileged, in a sense, to be able to contribute to open source.

18:45.120 --> 18:50.160
I don't like saying this, but I'll say it here, because you need to have time. You're willing to

18:50.160 --> 18:57.920
give away basically for free because you're not being compensated for the time to work on something.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.920
So, not a lot of people have that time because most people, especially people from disadvantaged

19:03.920 --> 19:09.760
backgrounds, they're more focused on putting food on the table. So, they're doing paid work.

19:11.520 --> 19:20.160
So, that's the second thing. Then I think the third thing would be skills. So, we, Africa,

19:20.160 --> 19:28.240
in general, hasn't had a lot of time to develop skill and talent as much as the West or Asia has.

19:28.240 --> 19:34.080
So, we're still playing catch up with the rest of the world. So, there's still a skills gap

19:34.080 --> 19:40.240
that needs to be filled. I think once that is filled, we'll have developers, our community

19:40.240 --> 19:46.240
members of the community in positions where they can contribute better. So, you'll find that most

19:46.240 --> 19:51.360
of the contributions to open source, I think, don't quote me on this, but I think you'll find

19:51.360 --> 19:56.000
that most of them come from economies that generally perform better than the rest of the

19:56.000 --> 20:02.560
world. Economies that generally perform better, like Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, or Kenya.

20:02.560 --> 20:08.400
So, the better infrastructure, better economies, and better levels of education, and better access

20:08.400 --> 20:17.440
to hardware, and these opportunities. You have big tech companies setting up lots of startups.

20:17.440 --> 20:26.160
So, it's a very difficult problem, but I think there's definitely lots of opportunity in

20:27.920 --> 20:35.360
contributing to open source. I gained a lot from working in open source. I learned a lot of things

20:35.360 --> 20:41.680
that I wouldn't otherwise have learned just from reading books or watching video tutorials. I've

20:41.680 --> 20:47.280
had opportunities that came as a result of that, but the unfortunate truth is that it's not easy

20:47.280 --> 21:00.400
for everyone to get into it. I also sometimes wonder, because in the few interactions I've had

21:01.440 --> 21:09.040
where during Hectorbofist, we as a community worked on this project that's ongoing, but

21:09.040 --> 21:18.000
we kind of focused on it. It was incredible to find how unfriendly a lot of open source

21:18.000 --> 21:23.520
tools and stuff is if you're on a Windows machine, for example, as opposed to a Mac or even Linux.

21:25.600 --> 21:32.320
I think in Africa, it's probably more prevalent for people to have Windows machines than it is

21:32.320 --> 21:43.440
to have Macs, for sure Macs. Maybe a lot of people don't know about Linux and also don't know which

21:43.440 --> 21:49.360
are the more user-friendly installations of those that has a more Windows-like experience,

21:49.920 --> 21:55.280
but will give you a better... Then, of course, Windows has come a long way in the sense of

21:55.280 --> 22:03.120
a Windows subsystem for Linux, but you need to run the very latest version of Windows. That

22:03.120 --> 22:08.560
sometimes means you have to have a pretty decent machine, so if you can't afford the expensive

22:08.560 --> 22:14.720
computer, you can't run the latest Windows, and so you don't have access to WSL. There you go.

22:15.280 --> 22:20.400
I think that might be another problem. You mentioned hardware access being one of the

22:20.400 --> 22:32.720
problems. I wonder if something like an incubator for open source in Africa would go some way

22:32.720 --> 22:38.960
towards this, because what I'm thinking is it's a means for young, and this is not young in age,

22:38.960 --> 22:47.200
young and experienced people, to have a starting point where they get paid a decent enough salary

22:47.200 --> 22:56.320
to work on open source, and through that, they then can get introduced to more opportunities.

22:57.040 --> 23:03.520
So, the incubator serves as an on-ramp into the industry, so it takes people in,

23:03.520 --> 23:09.840
it skills them up, and through skilling them up, they get paid, but they also contribute

23:09.840 --> 23:15.040
to open source projects, which again, benefits a whole large part of the economy, because

23:15.040 --> 23:21.280
everybody depends on open source these days, but then it gets them to a point where they can then

23:21.840 --> 23:28.000
leave the incubator and either start their own thing or join a company, because now they've

23:28.000 --> 23:32.960
experienced, and they could contribute to open source, because like you said, they can still

23:32.960 --> 23:37.360
put food on the table, because they're actually getting paid to do that. What do you think about

23:37.360 --> 23:45.280
something like that? I actually think it's a good idea, and I'd really prefer it if this came from

23:45.280 --> 23:57.840
the highest level, say, have governments introduce open source policies, that would drive demand for

23:57.840 --> 24:03.920
open source software. Say, for instance, the government were to stipulate that all government

24:03.920 --> 24:12.080
departments would use open source operating systems and open source software, so that would

24:12.080 --> 24:16.480
mean you'd have to have people skilled in installing these operating systems, in managing

24:16.480 --> 24:21.360
these operating systems, and using the software, and it would save them money, which is a good

24:21.360 --> 24:27.600
thing for government, because most of these tools are free, open source is free, and then it would

24:27.600 --> 24:36.560
then create demand for people with skills in using or handling open source software. And then

24:36.560 --> 24:43.120
these incubators would then have a pipeline, like you draw in the talent, you train the talent,

24:43.120 --> 24:47.840
and you have somewhere to move that talent to, because there's demand on the other side.

24:48.480 --> 24:53.680
So I think it would be to be a really good thing for all parties involved. Open source is free,

24:53.680 --> 25:01.200
so that cuts costs, it creates opportunities for people using it, and then it's a win-win for

25:01.200 --> 25:11.600
everyone. Yeah, yeah. I think it's a very good idea for governments to adopt this. My experience

25:11.600 --> 25:30.240
is that it's a hard place to start. It almost feels like industry needs to, I don't know how

25:30.240 --> 25:35.520
exactly this would work, but they have to kind of put pressure on the government to adopt these

25:35.520 --> 25:43.840
things, because I'm not sure that the governments even know. They just pay the licensing fee they've

25:43.840 --> 25:47.840
been paying for 20 years because it's what they've been doing. I don't know if there's enough.

25:50.320 --> 25:55.120
There's a company in South Africa called Open Up, and they do quite a bit of this, where they

25:55.120 --> 26:02.800
actually interface with municipalities and stuff like this, and they are very much into opening

26:02.800 --> 26:08.240
up data, but also the use of open source and that kind of stuff. So I think it's kind of like an

26:08.240 --> 26:14.160
education kind of thing, where there needs to be these companies that show government the benefits

26:14.160 --> 26:21.600
of open source, and show the possibility of creating jobs and developing talent, and maybe

26:21.600 --> 26:31.040
through creating something. Exactly, exactly. And maybe through setting an example, they'd be more

26:31.040 --> 26:36.640
willing to adopt it, and you'd probably have to start on a small scale. You might have to start

26:36.640 --> 26:41.760
with your own municipality and getting them to adopt some open source software, and then them

26:41.760 --> 26:46.000
going to their leaders and saying, hey, my goodness, look, we've been using this thing that we learned

26:46.000 --> 26:51.760
from these other guys, and it's saving us so much money, and there's a bunch of people that's being

26:51.760 --> 26:57.200
trained, that knows how to run these things, and then maybe it goes up the chain and up the chain,

26:57.200 --> 27:01.040
and eventually it gets adopted wider. I think there are some Asian countries that's actually

27:01.040 --> 27:07.920
doing a really good job with this. For some reason, Taiwan always comes to my mind, but I'm not sure

27:07.920 --> 27:13.920
if it's them who has really adopted a complete, and I think even South America, like Brazil and

27:13.920 --> 27:18.960
them, I think they've also adopted open source software quite heavily. So I think there's scope

27:18.960 --> 27:25.600
for that, and I do think that in the end of the day, that would be a good thing, but I do think

27:25.600 --> 27:34.240
industry will need to set an example and offer proof that it's not just talk, it's for real,

27:34.240 --> 27:39.200
like the benefits are real. But yeah, I think that that might be something that

27:40.560 --> 27:48.160
would be nice if one can get a couple of companies together to try this out and see what one can do.

27:48.160 --> 27:54.960
I think there are some education, some places doing education in South Africa, that is kind of

27:54.960 --> 28:01.520
got this idea, but again, there you sit with the problem of the monetary problem, whereas

28:02.000 --> 28:07.280
you're studying, so you're not earning anything yet. And so you have to, and that's definitely

28:07.280 --> 28:13.200
a massive problem. I mean, unemployment in South Africa is something like 50%. So if you have an

28:13.200 --> 28:20.560
unemployment rate of 50%, people don't have a lot of free time to give away of their precious time

28:20.560 --> 28:28.160
that they have. So you have to incentivize them monetarily as well. So on that topic, yep.

28:28.160 --> 28:35.840
I just want to say, this has a positive effect on people actually involved in work, that actually

28:35.840 --> 28:42.800
use the software, because say a municipality needs a certain feature, they could have their employees

28:42.800 --> 28:50.320
build the feature and then release it back into open source. So I mean, it's a hard problem to

28:50.320 --> 28:58.880
solve, but it has lots of benefits if it would be implemented right. Yeah, no, for sure. And I mean,

28:58.880 --> 29:06.640
and talking about that, I know you were a freelancer. I think you recently took a full-time

29:06.640 --> 29:16.720
position. Yeah. Am I correct there? Okay, cool. Yeah. So to dig into that a little bit. So

29:16.720 --> 29:24.480
in the beginning of this year, I officially started my own company. It's an open startup,

29:24.480 --> 29:29.840
which means we are fully transparent in terms of income, in terms of what we pay people,

29:31.040 --> 29:36.560
who our employees are. If the employee is okay with it, of course, we're not going to publish

29:36.560 --> 29:40.400
their stuff publicly if they don't want us to do that. But so far, everybody's fine with that.

29:40.400 --> 29:48.960
But our expenses, everything is open. And of course, we are heavily invested in open source.

29:48.960 --> 29:52.960
The company is completely based around open source. We give back to open source.

29:52.960 --> 29:59.120
We have a mandate of any project we rely on. We have to either financially or through

29:59.120 --> 30:09.600
contributions give back. What's your product? So at the moment, it's mostly around consulting

30:09.600 --> 30:17.200
and education, but we're building two products, one that's developer facing. It's called developer

30:17.200 --> 30:23.600
tool chest. It's a way of collecting a bunch of tools that you use often and giving you easy

30:23.600 --> 30:30.400
access to it. So you can just contribute to it, anything, and you tag it in ways that you'd

30:30.400 --> 30:36.640
obviously want to find it later on. And then it's just like a search interface. And also allow easy

30:36.640 --> 30:42.000
discovery of other tools you might not know about. And then we have some plans for going forward.

30:42.000 --> 30:50.000
The other one is called our backyard. And that is a platform to help small businesses

30:52.080 --> 30:59.760
get in front of people. So it's easy to find big box stores because they have thousands of runs

30:59.760 --> 31:06.320
to spend on advertising and big signs and big buildings. Whereas a lot of small businesses

31:06.320 --> 31:12.720
run from their own little house and they don't have a bunch of money. And so the idea is that

31:12.720 --> 31:17.840
our backyard is literally what the name suggests. It's where you go to find small businesses in

31:17.840 --> 31:25.920
your own community and support local business in your own community. So it's got that good

31:25.920 --> 31:33.440
thing to it. But then down the line, we will look at how we can responsibly make some money from it.

31:33.440 --> 31:41.680
Because, of course, at some point, it needs to make a profit. But we want to do it responsibly.

31:41.680 --> 31:47.040
So privacy is extremely important to us. So we don't want to stick a bunch of advertising

31:47.040 --> 31:52.000
in front of you. We don't want to track you everywhere you go. But we'll find a business

31:52.000 --> 31:59.120
model that works. Maybe it's something as simple as if this service is valuable to you,

31:59.120 --> 32:05.120
to give money to it on a monthly basis. Maybe it's a business model like that. Kind of like

32:05.120 --> 32:11.520
Open Collective. Because it's also built open source. The whole platform is built in the open.

32:14.720 --> 32:21.680
But with that said, it's not easy. It's definitely not easy. And doing it in the

32:21.680 --> 32:30.640
African context brings its own challenges. I heard a talk on a podcast of a guy called

32:30.640 --> 32:36.000
Lex Friedman, where he spoke to a woman that she started a business in Lagos,

32:36.000 --> 32:42.480
and then she started a business in the US. And she was talking about how different the

32:42.480 --> 32:49.600
experience was between the two. And what it boiled down to was that in the United States,

32:49.600 --> 32:56.480
with all its problems, the system is set up for you to succeed. Whereas, in her words,

32:57.200 --> 33:03.600
in Africa, it's set up for you to fail. Because the infrastructure, the support,

33:04.160 --> 33:09.440
it's just not there. More often than not, she got where she did because she knew the

33:09.440 --> 33:15.280
mayor in the town and she could ask for a favor. Whereas if she didn't, you know,

33:15.280 --> 33:19.760
she might never have gotten electricity to her business and the business would have failed.

33:20.720 --> 33:24.560
All these kinds of things. So, I'm curious, because there's another thing,

33:25.520 --> 33:32.480
because I know you struggled with this. So, if you're in a first world country,

33:32.480 --> 33:38.160
and you want to experiment with something, so you want to create a newsletter, and then you want to

33:38.160 --> 33:43.120
put some aspect of it, maybe you want to allow people to post comments on your newsletter,

33:43.120 --> 33:48.400
but only if they're a paid member, for example. Now, there's an array of options to do that.

33:48.400 --> 33:54.640
You can use Substack. You can use Ghost. There's a bunch of things. But if you're from Africa,

33:55.200 --> 34:02.560
you're going to hit a problem. And that is because the only processor they support is Stripe.

34:02.560 --> 34:08.880
And we don't have access to Stripe in Africa, in the entire continent we don't. Now,

34:08.880 --> 34:14.160
Stripe offers this thing called Stripe Atlas. I don't know if you've heard about that.

34:17.840 --> 34:21.920
Yeah, they create an LLC for you in Delaware, in the United States.

34:21.920 --> 34:31.520
But the thing is, it costs $500 to get that set up, and then $100 per year to keep that LLC going.

34:31.520 --> 34:36.800
Now, if you just want to experiment with a newsletter, that's a massive investment of

34:36.800 --> 34:40.720
money for something you don't know if it's going to succeed, and where you're going to

34:40.720 --> 34:47.280
charge people probably like $2 a month for a subscription. So, with all that context that

34:47.280 --> 34:55.040
I've given now, what were the problems that you faced that made you, that put you in a position

34:55.040 --> 35:00.480
where you had to say, you know what, I'm going to have to stop this freelance thing for a while,

35:00.480 --> 35:06.720
and just get a paid job where I'm a little bit more certain of my salary?

35:08.240 --> 35:14.320
So, before I started working as a developer, I used to run a web hosting business

35:15.440 --> 35:23.440
for Hanger Branding for a few years. And the biggest problem I've faced was the changing,

35:23.440 --> 35:29.840
like changes in business environment in Zimbabwe. The regulations are always changing. It's very

35:29.840 --> 35:37.920
hard to plan for your business. And getting money into a bank account is very difficult,

35:37.920 --> 35:43.920
because I think our currency has changed. I think we've changed currencies like five, four or five

35:43.920 --> 35:48.640
times in the past few years. So, one minute we're using US dollars, next minute we're using

35:48.640 --> 35:56.880
something different. So, that lack of consistency just made it very difficult. So, there were

35:56.880 --> 36:02.080
problems that were bigger than me that affected the clients that I had. Everyone was affected by

36:02.080 --> 36:08.160
this business environment. So, you'd have situations where clients weren't able to pay me on time,

36:08.160 --> 36:12.480
or if they were able to pay me, I'd just have problems collecting the money. Because if you

36:12.480 --> 36:19.440
have a client outside Zimbabwe, getting money into Zimbabwe is very difficult because of these

36:19.440 --> 36:24.800
problems with our banking system and everything. So, that was the biggest problem for me is just

36:24.800 --> 36:33.040
moving money. I had cash flow problems because of the changes and lack of consistency.

36:33.040 --> 36:38.640
So, I'd say that was the first one. And then the second one, the second challenge I had is,

36:39.840 --> 36:47.200
we have a number of payment options here. We have mobile money, we have bank transfers, we have

36:47.200 --> 36:54.320
online payments from debit cards and credit cards. But getting support for all those is very

36:54.320 --> 37:01.440
difficult. For instance, mobile money is run by a few telecoms companies, or the biggest one is

37:01.440 --> 37:11.840
Ecocash. And they're not very open to providing their API to small businesses. So, if you're

37:11.840 --> 37:17.360
starting out and you want to accept Ecocash payments or mobile money payments, it's not very

37:17.360 --> 37:25.440
easy to get that. So, that's one of the first problems. And then the second one is the payment

37:25.440 --> 37:36.080
processes we have here charge very high fees, just like Stripe does, the yearly fees. So, it can go

37:36.080 --> 37:43.280
in the way, go against running the business because you end up paying more to these payment

37:43.280 --> 37:51.840
processes that you're actually taking in. And then the last straw for me was the payment process I

37:51.840 --> 37:58.720
was using at the time to shut down. No warning, no compensation, no communication, nothing.

37:58.720 --> 38:04.640
It just shut down one day and it just stopped working. So, migrating the business to a new

38:04.640 --> 38:08.000
payment process, it would have just taken too long. And you're like, hey, you know what,

38:08.000 --> 38:14.240
I don't need this. So, that's when I notified all my customers. I just gave them free service for

38:14.240 --> 38:20.960
about a year while I helped them move their websites to different hosting providers. And

38:22.880 --> 38:28.720
that's when I was really done. Then I started looking for a job. So, yeah, it's hard to run

38:28.720 --> 38:35.040
a business here in Africa because of infrastructure problems and the business environment is just not

38:35.040 --> 38:43.200
set up for, that doesn't set you up for success. So, getting a job was another challenge because

38:43.200 --> 38:49.360
economy in Zimbabwe is not great right now. And that was the first thing. And the second thing

38:49.360 --> 38:55.120
was the skills I had learned where I couldn't get a job for the skills I had. So, I was forced to

38:55.120 --> 39:03.040
get a remote job from international companies. So, that comes with its own challenges. But

39:03.040 --> 39:06.800
unfortunately, I did get a job. I have a job now. I'm happy. So, yeah.

39:09.440 --> 39:18.400
Oh, I'm glad to hear that. So, okay, let's step back into something else. There's a project that

39:18.400 --> 39:25.120
I believe you started. And I believe I saw the tweet when this idea started in your head

39:25.120 --> 39:32.160
that ended up being Pai Pai in a box. Yeah. Do you want to dig into that? Because that's

39:32.160 --> 39:38.080
really, really cool. I read about it a bit more today and it's really cool if you want to tell

39:38.080 --> 39:45.600
us more about that. So, what started this project is part of the problems we've been talking about,

39:45.600 --> 39:51.360
infrastructure problems here in Africa. You go to a meetup, you're running a workshop, you want

39:51.360 --> 39:56.560
people to install some packages, and then the internet goes out or the power goes out. So,

39:56.560 --> 40:01.520
that basically means you can't do anything. You just have to talk through what you would have done.

40:02.160 --> 40:08.240
So, I got to a point where I attend a lot of conferences and I attend meetups and workshops,

40:08.240 --> 40:16.960
and I do trainings at these events. And that was my biggest frustration that I didn't have

40:16.960 --> 40:23.120
a reliable internet access or reliable power to run the workshops I needed to run. So, I thought,

40:23.120 --> 40:32.080
hey, what could I do to allow people in the workshops, guest attendees to install the

40:32.080 --> 40:37.920
software and not be bothered by whether there's internet or not? And then I figured, what if

40:37.920 --> 40:44.480
I could download the packages I needed onto a little computer, build, make it a Wi-Fi hotspot,

40:44.480 --> 40:47.760
have everyone connect to it, and then they could download packages? So, that's when

40:48.720 --> 40:54.560
I started tweeting about it, asking people how I could go about it. I did some research and I

40:54.560 --> 41:00.880
figured it's actually not difficult because firstly, Raspberry Pi is an affordable computer.

41:00.880 --> 41:05.200
At the time, they're still available, they're still affordable. You can buy, I bought one,

41:05.200 --> 41:14.160
I got a very large, like the largest size SD card I could get. I think it was 256 gigs. And then I

41:14.160 --> 41:21.040
cloned the Python package repository. So, it's like the NPM package repository if you're from

41:21.040 --> 41:28.240
JavaScript world. So, that was about, the download was about 100 gigs. So, I downloaded the packages

41:28.240 --> 41:36.480
and I found some software online that can recreate the structure of PyPI, which is the Python package

41:36.480 --> 41:44.080
index. So, it recreated the structure and indexed the packages and then I put a web server in front

41:44.080 --> 41:51.280
of that and then I configured the Raspberry Pi to act as a Wi-Fi hotspot. So, you can now, using

41:51.280 --> 42:00.000
this tool, install, do a pip install package name from a local repository instead of going to the

42:00.000 --> 42:05.520
Python package index. You know, pip, the package manager can do that. It allows you to install from

42:06.000 --> 42:14.240
offline or local package repositories. So, whenever we'd have an event here at Zimbabwe, I'd do that.

42:14.240 --> 42:18.480
I'd set up the Raspberry Pi, everyone would connect to it and they'd run that one command,

42:18.480 --> 42:26.560
they'd be able to install the packages that they needed. It's a, you know, it's a simple device,

42:26.560 --> 42:32.640
but it's really went a long way in making sure I can teach the way I wanted to teach, you know,

42:32.640 --> 42:37.280
whether there's internet or there's power, we always had a little Wi-Fi connection that could

42:38.000 --> 42:43.200
allow people to install software. Yeah, yeah, that's super cool. So, do you put like a

42:43.200 --> 42:49.600
a SIM card in the Raspberry Pi and it uses that to connect to the internet, like mobile?

42:50.480 --> 42:57.840
No, so the Raspberry Pi, the model I have is the latest model. So, it has an Ethernet port

42:57.840 --> 43:04.240
and it has Wi-Fi as well. So, the way I have it set up is I connect it to the internet via the

43:04.240 --> 43:11.280
Ethernet port and then set up a Wi-Fi hotspot on its Wi-Fi adapter. So, I can download packages

43:11.280 --> 43:19.040
using Ethernet and then broadcast Wi-Fi network using the Wi-Fi adapter. Now, alternatively,

43:19.040 --> 43:24.320
you can download packages on your laptop and then transfer them onto its little SD card because it

43:24.320 --> 43:30.000
uses an SD card as a hard drive. So, you can set up everything, all the files you need on your

43:30.000 --> 43:36.480
computer on the SD card and then transfer that to the Raspberry Pi. So, it works just like a normal

43:36.480 --> 43:41.920
computer except without all the fancy bells and whistles you'd expect from a powerful desktop.

43:42.800 --> 43:49.520
Yeah, yeah, that's super interesting. I know there's another project. It's not meant for

43:49.520 --> 43:53.600
Python or anything like that, but it's called Internet in a Box. I don't know if you know about

43:53.600 --> 44:01.360
that. Yes, I came across it when I was working on this. It's a very similar project. They do

44:01.360 --> 44:10.480
basically everything else. It's a digital library of different websites and stuff.

44:10.480 --> 44:17.760
Yeah, like Wikipedia and that kind of stuff. So, if you're in a rural area, you can put that down

44:17.760 --> 44:23.200
somewhere and people can have access to it. And then, if you once a month just do an update

44:23.200 --> 44:28.880
from the internet to make sure you have the latest content, then people don't need internet

44:28.880 --> 44:34.800
access to be able to access all this, which is amazing. I mean, sometimes the thing that stands

44:34.800 --> 44:42.640
between you and success is just having access to that content. So, yeah, it's great. I'm actually

44:42.640 --> 44:48.320
thinking of doing something similar. When I started this, it was just a proof of concept to

44:48.320 --> 44:54.560
see if I could do it. But now, what I want to do is I want to take the same concept and use it to

44:54.560 --> 45:02.080
make my own internet in a box. So, I only do Stack Overflow and Wikipedia. So, I found

45:02.080 --> 45:08.880
a lab tool called Keywigs that allows you to do this very easily. It bundles all the software you

45:08.880 --> 45:16.640
need to serve up clothed content offline easily. So, you just download the content, install this

45:16.640 --> 45:22.320
software, and then it allows you to serve up some Wikipedia or Stack Overflow easily. So,

45:22.320 --> 45:30.080
that's the next thing I'm going to try. Yeah, that sounds really cool. Do you know if there exists

45:30.080 --> 45:38.080
a similar thing to this for NPM, like NPM in a box? I actually haven't heard anything like that.

45:38.720 --> 45:42.800
So, I wouldn't know. I once asked on my Twitter, I've been on you, but I didn't get any responses.

45:42.800 --> 45:46.880
So, I'm not sure if it's there or people just ignore me. I don't know.

45:46.880 --> 45:52.320
Yeah. Would it be, thinking about your experience creating

45:52.320 --> 45:58.720
PyPy in a box, do you think it would be a lot of the work you've done is transferable to

45:59.520 --> 46:05.680
creating something like NPM in a box? With what you've done, would that have a lot of

46:05.680 --> 46:10.880
the infrastructure just reusable for that, or is it very specific to PyPy?

46:10.880 --> 46:17.680
I think it is. The concepts, rather, are reusable because I use a lot of Python packages to do this,

46:17.680 --> 46:24.800
but I think the principles can be applied to NPM. I'm not sure how packaging works in the

46:24.800 --> 46:32.320
JavaScript world, but I imagine JavaScript packages take up much more space than the

46:32.320 --> 46:38.160
Python packages. So, you'd need to find a way to download packages that you can fit into Raspberry

46:38.160 --> 46:43.600
Pi and then a way to index them and then serve them up. So, probably, for serving them up,

46:43.600 --> 46:48.960
you could use a web server like Nginx or something, and then indexing them, I don't know. I'm sure

46:48.960 --> 46:54.720
there's something NPM specific that you could do, but you just need to find the right tools,

46:54.720 --> 47:01.520
but it should definitely be possible. Yeah. So, what do you use for indexing PyPy?

47:01.520 --> 47:06.000
Because I'm thinking, the name is just in my head now, it's hard again.

47:06.000 --> 47:13.920
So, there's this thing called PyPy server. You point it to where you have the Python packages

47:13.920 --> 47:20.400
downloaded. It runs through the list and then creates an index. That makes it easy for the

47:20.400 --> 47:25.920
PIP tool to find the package. You can find the package based on the name or its metadata.

47:25.920 --> 47:31.520
You can figure out what dependencies it depends on. So, indexing really is useful. It saves you

47:31.520 --> 47:37.280
a bunch of time instead of searching through the entire package repo every time you want to do a

47:37.280 --> 47:45.440
PIP install. Yeah. I wonder whether Algolia or something like that, I wonder if you can run that

47:46.560 --> 47:56.080
on a server with NPM and use Algolia to index the NPM registry. That'd be interesting.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.320
I'm really curious if this is possible. Yeah, it could be an interesting problem to

48:00.320 --> 48:07.600
solve. Yeah, for sure. Like you said, I'm sitting here and I was speaking to you and the only reason

48:07.600 --> 48:14.240
I can is because I'm plugged into a big battery because currently we're being load shed. So,

48:14.240 --> 48:21.840
we don't have electricity at the moment. So, I have a big battery that I'm plugged in and because

48:21.840 --> 48:29.120
of that, I still have internet access and I can actually speak to you. I only bought it this week

48:29.120 --> 48:35.440
and it was very expensive. I had to put money aside and thankfully, I have a business. So,

48:36.880 --> 48:44.160
I did some extra work for extra clients and so far, it seems like it was definitely a good buy,

48:44.160 --> 48:49.680
but it's not cheap and it's not something that's accessible to many people, unfortunately. So,

48:49.680 --> 48:53.040
there's a lot of people around me sitting without electricity right now. So,

48:53.040 --> 49:02.720
I did that recently, so I can relate. Yeah. So, I can totally see a situation where you're in the

49:02.720 --> 49:08.240
middle of a workshop and there goes the power and you're like, oh boy, now what do we do? So,

49:08.240 --> 49:13.520
being able to whip out a Raspberry Pi with NPM on it would be super useful. So, I think it's something

49:13.520 --> 49:20.720
that as Mechanical Ink should spend some time on and I might just need to tap your brain for some

49:20.720 --> 49:26.240
knowledge. Yeah, I'm happy to. I'd love to actually see that, because I know that would definitely

49:26.240 --> 49:31.040
have more of a use case here than the Python thing does, because there are generally more

49:31.040 --> 49:40.240
JavaScript developers around than Python ones. Interesting. So, what I also saw is, I think,

49:40.240 --> 49:45.360
maybe PyPy in a box presented an opportunity for yourself, because you recently gave a talk about

49:45.360 --> 49:52.480
it at the Ubuntu Summit in Prague. Yes. How was that experience? So, what happened is, interesting,

49:53.280 --> 49:59.200
I gave a talk about the same project in Namibia at the Python conference in 2020.

49:59.920 --> 50:06.160
When did COVID start? 2020. Yeah, so I gave a conference. Yeah, the last conference I attended

50:06.160 --> 50:12.640
was just before COVID started. So, in 2020, I gave a conference, a talk at Namibia, and one of the

50:12.640 --> 50:18.560
community managers at Canonical was in attendance at the conference. He heard the talk and, hey,

50:18.560 --> 50:23.520
that's actually a good idea. And so, this year, he invited me to speak at the Ubuntu Summit. So,

50:23.520 --> 50:30.560
the Ubuntu Summit is a Ubuntu conference that seeks to invite community members and Canonical

50:30.560 --> 50:36.000
staff, put them in a room together for a few days, and share stories about how people are using

50:36.000 --> 50:42.240
Ubuntu and Linux and open source in general. So, I got to present about how I was using Ubuntu on an

50:42.240 --> 50:49.280
Raspberry Pi to do that. So, giving that talk led to that opportunity to be invited to that conference.

50:49.280 --> 50:53.040
And it was my first time in Europe. I'd never been to Europe, so I got to travel to Europe,

50:53.920 --> 51:00.080
give the talk, meet fantastic people from the Canonical team. It was at a fantastic time.

51:02.160 --> 51:06.960
Yeah, it's always great. I remember the first time I went to the US when I started contracting

51:06.960 --> 51:16.000
at Mozilla. It was also like a complete culture shock. And you can understand how there's so many

51:17.120 --> 51:23.360
tech companies because everywhere around you, like if you sit in a little coffee shop and you're

51:23.360 --> 51:28.880
just talking, everybody around you are talking about their startup and about this problem they're

51:28.880 --> 51:35.440
having with this program. And so, there's this energy in the air that's very, very contagious.

51:35.440 --> 51:40.000
So, I was wondering with that conference that you were able to attend in Prague and now that

51:41.520 --> 51:47.760
we're slowly walking our way out of the pandemic and starting to... But we've also learned some

51:47.760 --> 51:53.680
lessons about the fact that in-person events are great, but it doesn't necessarily... The

51:53.680 --> 51:58.240
world doesn't have to come to a complete standstill if we can't get on a plane and fly somewhere.

51:58.240 --> 52:06.480
So, we can do a lot of these things virtually. So, do you think if we can install a more active

52:09.200 --> 52:17.920
conference circuit, so to speak, in Africa, do you think that would foster a more active startup

52:17.920 --> 52:25.440
culture? Because that's the one thing that I find is very, very active in Europe and in the US.

52:25.440 --> 52:32.320
And I think a lot of great ideas come out of just this concept of trying something and being

52:32.320 --> 52:37.440
willing to fail, but also being willing to pivot. But I do think, like I said, you have to have a

52:37.440 --> 52:45.680
culture, you have to have an active community that encourages this. So, do you think if we can

52:45.680 --> 52:51.520
somehow, maybe starting all virtually, because that's also cheaper than having to fly all over

52:51.520 --> 52:57.680
the place and also better for the environment, do you think if we can install this idea of having

52:57.680 --> 53:02.480
more Africa-focused conferences, speaking about stuff like what me and you have been talking

53:02.480 --> 53:08.560
about now, the challenges and possible solutions, do you think if we can kickstart something like

53:08.560 --> 53:13.680
that, that that'll, by its very nature, install this idea of a startup culture?

53:13.680 --> 53:24.640
I think it would, because we all have similar problems, similar challenges we face. And I think

53:24.640 --> 53:31.600
now physical conferences, like physical meetups, we actually work better than virtual ones, because

53:31.600 --> 53:39.280
I think the networking opportunity that gives you allows people to just share ideas and talk about

53:39.280 --> 53:44.000
problems. Some of the things that people talk about come up, even not in the conference talk,

53:44.000 --> 53:50.080
but in the hallway track, or in the dinners, or in the lunches, whatever. It's like we can share

53:50.080 --> 53:56.640
ideas and conferences or meetups are very good places to talk about stuff or to learn about stuff

53:56.640 --> 54:04.000
you don't really know. Because when you're to the conference, you can learn something you

54:04.000 --> 54:09.600
weren't aware that you didn't know. Like, oh, that could be really useful for this project that I'm

54:09.600 --> 54:18.560
trying to solve. It allows you to make connections and to learn stuff. So I definitely think

54:19.600 --> 54:26.240
that conferences would help, because we don't have enough conferences, I'd say, or meetups,

54:26.240 --> 54:32.720
because most of the conferences I've seen are enterprise conferences where companies are getting

54:32.720 --> 54:41.840
together. They're okay, but they have a bottom line goal most of the time. And I think we need

54:41.840 --> 54:48.400
more community-focused conferences that just allow people to meet and share ideas and figure out a

54:48.400 --> 54:55.200
way to solve common problems. So yeah, I think it would help. Yeah, 100% agree. Yeah, a lot of those

54:55.200 --> 55:02.080
others are more trying to sell you their products and services than really fostering a community of

55:02.080 --> 55:08.960
makers. So yeah, I agree. So you're an AWS certified cloud practitioner. By the way,

55:08.960 --> 55:17.440
congratulations on having achieved that. That's no small feat. But I do see that you also use

55:17.440 --> 55:24.640
a service called Devo. How do those differ or are they more similar than different?

55:24.640 --> 55:36.960
I'd say one is an abstraction over the other. So Devo is an enterprise solution.

55:38.320 --> 55:44.240
What their goal is to unify multiple clouds. So say you have a business, you want to put your

55:44.240 --> 55:49.600
business on the cloud, but you don't want to deal with the complexity of choosing a cloud or you

55:49.600 --> 55:55.360
want to put some information in one region or one cloud and whatnot, they take care of all that for

55:55.360 --> 56:00.320
you. So they just provide you with a platform, you upload your code, and then you can choose through

56:00.320 --> 56:03.840
a drop-down what cloud you want to put this on, what region you want to put this on, and then they

56:03.840 --> 56:09.360
take care of all that. So you could actually have an app that has some data in Azure, some data in

56:09.360 --> 56:15.200
Google, and then some data in AWS in a specific region. They can take care of that for you. So

56:15.200 --> 56:24.560
I'd say that's how they differ. But at the end of the day, Devo does use AWS under the hood. Now,

56:25.120 --> 56:35.280
if I were to release an app, develop an app, there'd be times where I choose Devo and other

56:35.280 --> 56:42.880
times where I prefer to use AWS or another service. So Devo is mostly focused on enterprise. So you'll

56:42.880 --> 56:47.680
find that their paid plans are quite pricey. I think they issued this plan, the last I checked

56:47.680 --> 56:54.640
was like $150 a month or something. But they had a very good free developer plan. So if I was just

56:54.640 --> 57:01.440
building a pit project that needed a home and URLs, load balancing, and a server, I'd use Devo.

57:01.440 --> 57:06.800
It's a very easy platform to use. You download the CLI, you Dockerize your project, you just push

57:06.800 --> 57:14.080
the basis. It's very similar to Heroku. So they have a nice platform, good documentation,

57:14.080 --> 57:22.240
really easy to set up Dockerized applications and give them an online presence. But I'd say

57:23.520 --> 57:31.360
AWS is, if I was running a business, I'd probably put my product on AWS or even Azure or any other

57:31.360 --> 57:39.200
cloud, because you get more options, more fine grain control over what you spend your money on,

57:39.200 --> 57:45.840
you know, AWS. So there's easy solutions to AWS. If you just want to get an application online,

57:45.840 --> 57:50.960
there's solutions, you know, things like Elastic Beanstalk, you know, you can use

57:50.960 --> 57:56.560
Elastic Beanstalk, just put up a website online and then Amazon will take care of auto scaling,

57:56.560 --> 58:02.560
load balancing, security, provisioning, and all that. Or if you have more skills,

58:02.560 --> 58:08.800
you can get a VPS. You can get a VPS from them and do all that yourself. So it really depends on

58:09.440 --> 58:13.840
what you want to do, you know, how much time you have and how much money you're willing to spend.

58:13.840 --> 58:18.960
Because obviously, AWS, like Elastic Beanstalk is more expensive because it's a managed service. So

58:20.320 --> 58:23.600
you get a lot of things out of the box and you pay more for it.

58:23.600 --> 58:35.200
Okay, interesting. So on that topic, I've spoken to somebody before, Chelsea Adams, and she

58:36.000 --> 58:42.240
also does quite a bit of the AWS kind of stuff, but she also does front end and that kind of thing,

58:42.240 --> 58:49.920
but she's well versed when it comes to AWS, for example. And I think one thing that she mentioned

58:49.920 --> 58:57.200
that I found interesting, and it's true, most, I don't want to say all because that would be

58:57.200 --> 59:06.640
unfair, but most of these bootcamps or even like longer term educational institutions that provide

59:06.640 --> 59:17.520
specifically education around front end development, they stop short of, okay,

59:17.520 --> 59:23.520
now I can build a React application, but how do I put it online? Maybe they'll show you how to do it

59:23.520 --> 59:28.880
with like using GitHub pages or something like that. But I mean, if you want to do a production

59:28.880 --> 59:34.400
app, that's not really, you know, the way you're going to go. And so the one thing that she

59:34.400 --> 59:44.000
mentioned is there's a hole there that needs to be filled in the sense that there's not really

59:44.000 --> 59:50.560
any good education, accessible, good education out there to teach front end developers, how do

59:50.560 --> 59:57.280
I put this app of mine online the right way? You know, it's easy to put it online, but how do I

59:57.280 --> 01:00:03.760
put it online the right way so that if I announced this on my social media network and some famous

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:11.200
person retweets my thing and 10,000 people hit my website, that is not going to go down. And also

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.240
that I'm not going to tomorrow morning wake up and somebody's going to say, why is there a bunch of

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:23.600
porn on your URL? Because somebody hacked your website. So do you have any like tips or good

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.760
resources or something that you can recommend to people if they want to like know how to do that

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:36.160
stuff the right way? I didn't know front end had this problem as well. I thought it was just a

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:44.000
Python problem. But yeah, deployment is hard, which is actually one of the reasons why I

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.880
got into DevOps. I wanted to learn more about deployment and how to do it and automate stuff to

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:58.480
make it easy. But in terms of general tips, I don't have any resources I can think of right now,

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:05.280
but I have a few tips that I'd like to give. Like there's certain things that I think

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.520
most people aren't taught in these boot camps about how to make deployments go well. The first

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:18.320
thing I think is to think about security from the get go. Don't start thinking about security

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.760
when you're ready to deploy. So that will help you avoid making mistakes that could later burn you.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.160
So you mentioned that you're setting up a website and putting porn. People can do that. And one of

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:37.120
the reasons why some of these things are possible is say you put up your code in Git. So first thing,

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:44.800
learn how to use Git correctly. If your project doesn't need to be open source,

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:51.360
don't make your code publicly available. Keep it private. That helps hide mistakes you may have

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:56.880
made. Whereas if your project is publicly available and people can see information,

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.880
sensitive information, you don't want them to see that. That gives them keys to doing bad stuff on

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:10.000
your website. But in a more general sense, I'd say that the first thing to watch out for is just

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:18.400
make sure you handle credentials correctly. Like don't hard code passwords and credentials into

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:24.880
your code. That's easy to do when you're just mucking around locally, but you can forget to

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:32.400
remove that stuff. So don't put credentials in the code. And if you're using environment files,

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.880
try and avoid adding them to Git. Don't track them. Don't push them up to GitHub, wherever

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.160
you're pushing your code. So try and keep your code separate from your credentials.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:50.560
So there are services you can use. You could use password managers to manage your passwords. You

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:59.920
can use password vaults that would inject the credentials into your environment while you have

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:07.760
it running locally, so that you never have your credentials available in an unencrypted text file,

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:15.120
for instance. So there's things like that. I think KeePass has an open source tool you can

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.120
install in your environments that can manage credentials for you. There's something called

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:26.560
HashiCorp Vault. You can install that on your server. It manages secrets for you. And then

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.240
once you're ready to deploy, I'd say make use of environment variables on the deployment server.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:39.280
So whatever service you're deploying to, put your passwords there, the secrets and credentials there

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:47.840
instead of hard coding. So that's the first thing that would help reduce the risk of being hacked.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:54.880
It's not the only thing, but it really helps. And then I'd say the second thing is,

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:05.520
if you can afford it, try and get a service that allows you to auto scale easily.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:14.560
If you look at cloud solutions like AWS or Azure, there are tools that allow you to auto scale. So

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:21.760
if you put up your website and it gets popular, all those auto scaling solutions will allow your

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.720
traffic, will keep your website running even if it gets hit by like 10,000 requests or a lot of

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:32.800
people start using it. It will cost you money, but you won't have to think about it because

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:40.240
it's done for you. So if you can afford it, look into something like that. And then I think the

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:49.440
last thing I'd say is try and make your deployments repeatable. And I know for front-end

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:54.160
developers, this might mean learning some skills that they may not generally want to learn, but

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:01.600
learn something about CI, CD and how that works. If you can get an automated deployment pipeline

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:10.960
going, do that because having that deploying code for you will allow you to run checks on your code

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:17.920
to make sure that the tool catches any errors you could introduce early before you actually do the

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:24.000
deployment. So you can look into that and try and make the deployments as automated and as repeatable

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:33.280
as possible. Yeah. So I think GitHub is doing a lot to make this more accessible through

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.760
GitHub, CI, CD, your GitHub actions and that kind of stuff. Do you use something like Terraform?

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.920
Not for the current project I work on, no. Okay. Yeah. I know it's some folks that Mozilla uses

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:54.640
Terraform and then Kubernetes, I think is one of the other things that people use. Yeah, I use

01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:02.800
Kubernetes, but not Terraform. Okay. Okay. Yeah. But yeah, I think those are all great tips and

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.640
I would highly recommend people look that up and I'll add links to all of these things

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:15.840
when we publish this episode. So in closing, something fun. In your bio on your website,

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:22.000
you said you like cutting wood. Yes. Tell me more about that. Tell me more about that.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:29.040
Okay. So software development is very stressful and you need an outlet to release that stress.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.080
Cutting wood is a very good outlet. Wood doesn't complain. Wood can take a beating. So

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:44.080
I like to cut wood. But on a serious note, it's very similar to software development. You need

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:50.000
to think about what you want to make. You need to design what you want to build. You need to choose

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:57.120
the right tools and you need to follow a logical sequence of steps to get to make whatever it is

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:03.920
you want to make. And so it's a very, I'd say it's a good hobby to pursue if you're in software

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.400
development because many of the skills you learn, you know, from developing software are easily

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:13.840
transferable to woodworking. You just need to find the right tools, determine what you want

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:20.400
to build. Like I don't make any fancy furniture or anything like that. I can't do that. I make very

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:27.600
simple tables and desks, you know, like flat things, not flat corners, you know, but it's a really

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.640
nice fulfilling feeling to work on something you actually built yourself. Yeah, for sure. And like

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:40.080
I said, if you're stressed, you can hammer it with all day and all night because you're probably

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:47.600
going to make something good out of it. I really enjoy doing that and watching videos of experienced

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:55.040
carpenters and woodworkers doing DIY stuff. I'm really heavily into DIY. I believe every person

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.720
should at least know how to fix something. Yeah, for sure. So I really enjoy watching that stuff

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.840
and trying it on my own when I have the time. Yeah, yeah. I love those videos of the people

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:11.840
that do the woodturning where they have, you know, those big fancy machines that like take this

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:20.160
rough piece of wood and they just turn it and it's this beautiful shapes and just these gradients

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:26.560
that the colors of the wood forms. And it's so meditative to watch that stuff. It's just beautiful.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.480
So I can imagine if, you know, if you can get to that point where you can actually do that

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.760
yourself, it'll be an amazing experience. But I think even starting with a pocket knife and a

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:43.440
piece of wood can be a nice start. Definitely, definitely. I have a friend who actually started

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:50.000
that way. You know, he used to make these little walking sticks and now he runs a business and

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:57.120
makes furniture. So you can start as a hobby and turn into a business. Yeah, for sure. That's great.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.240
Well, thank you so much for this conversation. I really, really enjoyed it. It was

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:10.480
lovely to talk to somebody in Africa that shares a lot of the pain that I go through as well.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:18.000
But I think you also have some unique challenges that we in South Africa might not always face.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.600
But still, I think there's a lot of opportunities and I think we should connect more

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.320
and cross-pollinate. And I'm definitely going to hit you up about the whole NPM in the box.

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:33.680
I'm definitely going to contact you. And let's chat about that and make that a thing. I think

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:40.160
that'll be super interesting to do, but also super useful. So thanks so much for the conversation and

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.920
have a lovely rest of your day. And all the best for the future. And I'm looking forward to seeing

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.000
all the wonderful things you do. Thanks a lot. Cheers.
