00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Welcome to the Mycelium Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,280
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,760
Hey, Buisile, thanks so much for joining me for the Mycelium Network Podcast.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,160
The pleasure is mine. I'm happy to be here.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,360
How's yours? How's your day been so far?

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
It's been a good day. It's been a good day. It's raining here in Zimbabwe,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,160
so you're always welcome. Yeah, that's very true. That's very true.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,000
So, I think let's just get this conversation right off to a start.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,480
So, I know you from way back in the day when we met at a Mozilla event, I believe it was.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,560
I think it might even have been something to do with Firefox OS still back in the day.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,720
Yeah, that was in Johannesburg. That is correct. That is correct.

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,760
And after that, I've been following you on Twitter and I've been seeing the conversations

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,680
you've been having and all the things you've been up to. And when I started this whole community

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,680
and I started the podcast, I've always meant to invite you. So, I'm glad that I finally did

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,080
and that you were available and that we can have this conversation. Because I do think that you

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,600
have an interesting perspective and that you have a good story to tell and I would love to

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,720
give you a voice. So, to get us started, tell us more about who you are, how you got into

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,760
development, where did you grow up, anything that in your early years that might have been a catalyst

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:49,760
to kickstart your career, kickstart your interest in tech. And then just as an aside at some point,

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,160
I'm always curious when people have like a pseudonym on the internet what the story

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,840
behind it is. And like on Github and Twitter, you have this pseudonym called Terra Maiar,

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,120
if I'm pronouncing it correctly. So, I'm curious if there's a story behind that.

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:14,160
Okay. All right. That's okay. Let me tell my story. So, I was raised in Zimbabwe.

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:26,160
I've always loved tech and computers. I've always been intrigued by how they work. I'd say I'm a

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:37,120
logical person, I think in a bullet point kind of way, like a very sequential way. Computers

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,960
work the same. So, I just understood them. And so, I've always loved computers. And I used to

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,000
go to my sister's workplace just to play with her computer back in the day. We didn't have a

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,720
computer. I didn't have a personal computer at home. So, the only computers I came across were

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,440
computers in people's workplaces. I would always visit friends and family's offices just to use

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,080
their computer. That's how I got to learn how to use a computer. And then, once I knew enough,

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,680
I started going to internet cafes, messing around on the internet, you know, started joining forums

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,840
and chat groups and things like that. And so, that's how my interest in computers was what it

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,920
peaked at that point, I'd say. And then after high school, I went to a polytechnic college,

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:37,200
I studied IT. So, I learned formally about computers and information technology. Unfortunately,

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,920
I wasn't able to graduate because of financial problems and some other personal reasons that

36
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,600
kept me from completing that course. But I still loved it. And I still carry that knowledge I gained

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:02,720
from them with me. So, after I finished or after college was done, I started contributing to open

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,240
source. That's when I started. I found Mozilla. I joined Mozilla community at first. I was just

39
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:15,280
doing translation. I worked on Firefox OS translation into Hindi, the language I speak here.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,920
And then from there, as I met more people, I got more and more involved in the community,

41
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:29,920
and then contributed to QA. We used to do QA testing for pre-release Firefox builds and even

42
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Firefox OS at some point. And then that was when I was introduced to programming because a lot of

43
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,800
the QA engineers at Mozilla used Python to automate the tests that they used to against the Firefox

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,720
or many of the internal Mozilla websites they were testing. So, that's when I was introduced to Python

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,960
and got interested, and I started learning it. So, I started learning. That was around 2013,

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,680
2014, I think. And yeah, that's when my Python journey started. And then after that,

47
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,240
after a few years, I learned Python. I watched some YouTube tutorials. I read some books. I

48
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,240
bought some courses, and I got good at it. But unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a job

49
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,080
because something the tech pros on YouTube don't tell you is when you're learning a

50
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,640
tool or programming language, you need to learn something that makes sense for where you are.

51
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:40,320
And there isn't a big market for Python here in Zimbabwe, so I learned that the hard way.

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,720
But yeah, after a while, I eventually found remote jobs. And that's how I got into

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,640
software development using Python. Okay. That's interesting. That is an interesting perspective

54
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,720
to think about not only which language, but which language is in demand where you live.

55
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:09,120
I guess that's to some extent true in South Africa as well. I don't know now. I've not been

56
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,840
super in touch with the workforce in South Africa for quite some time. But I know when I started,

57
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,200
Java was definitely the language du jour. If you wanted a job, you had to know Java.

58
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,200
That's why I always say I have a love-hate relationship with Java because I never

59
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,480
enjoyed the language. But I am grateful for the opportunities that it given me because it

60
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,880
introduced me to open source and it allowed me to get a job, a decent paying job, which allowed me

61
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:56,240
to explore some other avenues. But I definitely quickly discovered that for me, that wasn't the

62
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,120
language and especially not J2EE. The enterprise stuff was definitely not where my love and interest

63
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:13,360
lie. But I'm grateful for what it introduced me to. So is there a story behind TerraMajor

64
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,920
or is it just something you picked? Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention. So when I was

65
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,920
fooling around on the internet, I wanted to have a pseudonym I could use across all my socials.

66
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,640
Right. And the name is a pretty common name here in Africa. So most of the time when I try to use

67
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,720
the name, it'll be taken. So I had to come up with something unique, but that also spoke to the kind

68
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:47,600
of person I was. So TerraMajor is an acronym. I'd say it describes me in a sense. It stands for

69
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:55,520
Tremendously Exuberant, Risen, and Real Attitude. That's a terra. I think that's what I am,

70
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,800
I'd like to say. And then major is just like a major, like a title from an army.

71
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,720
Oh, okay. Someone who has that attitude and who's also a major. And I just felt it different

72
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:15,360
weirdly so that I would always be unique. That's very interesting. So I did that with us as young,

73
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,680
just straight out of college. And the name stuck. Unfortunately, I've built my brand, so to speak,

74
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,880
quote unquote, around that name. So I haven't really changed it. So you'll find most of my socials,

75
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,120
I'm TerraMajor on most of my socials. It's like GitHub, Twitter, everywhere.

76
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,840
That's very interesting. Yeah. I always like hearing the stories behind the names. So as you

77
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:45,520
mentioned, even though Python wasn't the language that you needed in Zimbabwe to get a job, it's

78
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,480
still a language that you learned. And I know that you love Python. That's what I can tell from

79
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,240
your tweets and all this stuff you do. And I have to say, if I had to pick a backend language,

80
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,520
other than Node, i.e. JavaScript, I would probably pick Python as well. I really love the syntax.

81
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:17,280
I really like the rules of Python. Are you thinking Python? It resonates with me very much.

82
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:25,360
But you, as somebody who uses Python as your main language, what is it about Python that attracted

83
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,720
you and what do you love about Python? Okay. So like I mentioned, firstly, I learned Python

84
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,240
because that's what all the cool engineers at Mozilla used. That's what first got me into Python.

85
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:46,000
But then as I learned, it was really easy for me to learn. Unlike languages like C++ or Java,

86
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,720
it read like English. It's very straightforward. You can pick up a Python program and figure out

87
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,560
what it does, even when you're not very experienced with programming. So that was what got me

88
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,360
interested in Python. But really what made me love the language as much as I do is the community.

89
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,840
It is a fantastic community. And as someone who was finding their way, I was on my own. I didn't

90
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,360
have a college degree. I didn't have a lot of support here. So I had to lean on the Python

91
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,520
community to basically get mentorship, get opportunities. And the community was fantastic.

92
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,360
Very friendly people, very helpful, and very accommodating. So that's what really

93
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:42,080
made me like the language as much as I do. But another thing is, it's a bit of, it's really

94
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:49,440
sentimental. Because I learned Python, and then I couldn't get a job. So I had to make a choice.

95
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,200
Because either I pick up a language like Java, or one of the.NET languages that are common here,

96
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,560
even wanted to get a job, or I could just stick it out and not give up and just keep pushing

97
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,440
until I got the job. Because I already put in the time to learn this language. So that's what I did.

98
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,280
I chose the second option. You know what? You have already put in this work. Just see it through.

99
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:20,560
So I went through a very difficult phase where I forced myself to learn enough Python to get a job.

100
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,400
That was my goal. I was like, you know what? Just get a job that way you can use Python, and then

101
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,840
that way I won't feel like a failure for learning it. And so it's one of those things where I just

102
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,360
had to stick through with it. I had to learn the language. I had to learn the language.

103
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:48,160
I had to make it work. So I did that. I got the job. And now I'm actually trying to move away from

104
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,640
Python and learn different languages. I don't want to be the Python guy. I just want to be able to

105
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,720
code in Python and other languages. Is there any other language specifically that you're thinking

106
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:11,680
about? Go and Rust on my radar. Yeah, those are good ones. I always mean to learn Rust, but

107
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,960
JavaScript evolves so fast that I'm finding it hard enough to keep up with JavaScript.

108
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,560
Exactly. But I'm just like, oh, my goodness, what's this new thing in JavaScript today? Okay,

109
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,680
wait, let me just figure this one out first before I try a new language. But at some point,

110
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,640
I'd like to learn Rust because I think some of the backend stuff that I'm doing,

111
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,600
especially the one side project I'm working on, if that kicks off and is successful,

112
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,040
I think it would be beneficial if I have the backend written in Rust as opposed to in Node.

113
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,560
I think Rust will allow me to scale much, much better than doing Node. Because with Rust,

114
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,520
if I understand correctly, I'm going to be much closer to the metal instead of having to go

115
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,560
through a translation layer that then speaks to the metal, which is always a good thing if you

116
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:15,120
want to eke out that extra bit of performance. That's basically how I learn. I put myself in a

117
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,360
situation where I'm like, okay, I'm going to do this project and I'm going to do it in Rust,

118
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:27,520
and now I have no choice. I have to learn it. I don't know. That's just how I learn. So,

119
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,560
I have to think which area I want to go into. Let's dig into community a little bit.

120
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,080
Among the many things I do is, well, I've started this community called Mercedes Network,

121
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:54,320
but I'm also the community manager for MDN Web Docs at Mozilla. So, I'm more and more involved

122
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,920
in everything community. One of the reasons for it is, like you said, I think it's often

123
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:10,960
the differentiator and the enabler for a lot of people where you don't feel alone.

124
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,800
Because I think oftentimes it's not easy to give up, but you're more likely to give up if

125
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,440
you don't have a community that either holds you accountable or simply inspires you or both.

126
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:32,400
So, what are your feelings? That's how I think about community. What is important to you

127
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:43,040
about community? Well, it's two things really. Sharing of skills and opportunities. When you're

128
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,280
learning on your own, when you're self-taught, or when you're just figuring stuff out from doing a

129
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:55,200
bunch of tutorials online, you really don't know what you don't know. It's beneficial to be part

130
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,840
of a community with people who are more experienced than you because they can help you see the things

131
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,280
or figure out the things you're supposed to know that you're not aware that you don't know.

132
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,720
So, that helps a lot. And it helps also, like you mentioned, to see people doing the stuff you want

133
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,360
to do in the real world and actually making an impact using the stuff you're learning. So,

134
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,720
it gives you the motivation to work towards a goal to be like them. Like I mentioned, I learned

135
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,920
Python because the cool engineers at Mozilla were using it and it looked cool and I liked that.

136
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,120
I wanted to be like them and then that's what got me involved. And then along the way, as I was

137
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,720
learning, I had people in the community I could reach out to for help when I needed it. And these

138
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,120
are people who are leaders in respecting different fields. So, I knew I was always getting the right

139
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,760
kind of guidance and the right kind of information. And it helped to have that. Unlike where you just

140
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,320
have to Google like on Stack Overflow or something, it helped to have that human connection.

141
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:10,160
Yeah, for sure. I totally agree. So, then on a slightly related but tougher topic,

142
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,960
I'd just like to get your input. So, I recently learned that of all contributions to open source,

143
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:26,000
only 17% comes from Africa. That blew my mind because that's a very, very small number

144
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:36,320
if you take into account how many people are on this continent. So, my one question is,

145
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:47,760
why do you think are holding people back from it? And then what role can open source play

146
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,800
in lifting people up and creating opportunity? Because I strongly believe open source has

147
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:00,720
tremendous possibility to open up doors for people. And I think you've experienced it through

148
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,520
the whole Mozilla thing and you mentioned getting into open source early. So, what are your thoughts

149
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,880
on those topics? Why do you think there's such a small number of people contributing to open

150
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:18,560
source? And what can we do about that? Man, this one is a tricky one because I think

151
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:30,960
it's to do with lack of access. So, I'd say there's poorly developed infrastructure

152
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:39,520
that plays a role. Lack of skills to effectively contribute to some open source project. And

153
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,680
I guess this also falls under infrastructure is that internet access is not widely distributed,

154
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:54,720
I mean, evenly distributed in Africa. So, you'll find that in landlocked countries, generally,

155
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,160
the internet tends to be slower because they don't have a lot of inland fiber connections. So,

156
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,480
because it's slower, they use technologies like satellite, UHF and whatnot. These are

157
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,440
slow and expensive. So, internet access for the most part is not... A lot of people have access to

158
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,600
high speed internet and if they do have it, it's expensive. That's the first problem. In most of

159
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,120
Africa, there is, of course, the power of problems and a lot of infrastructure problems. Then that

160
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,800
aside, I think the second reason why we don't have a lot of contributions in open source is

161
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:45,120
time. I'd say one has to be privileged, in a sense, to be able to contribute to open source.

162
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,160
I don't like saying this, but I'll say it here, because you need to have time. You're willing to

163
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,920
give away basically for free because you're not being compensated for the time to work on something.

164
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,920
So, not a lot of people have that time because most people, especially people from disadvantaged

165
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:09,760
backgrounds, they're more focused on putting food on the table. So, they're doing paid work.

166
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:20,160
So, that's the second thing. Then I think the third thing would be skills. So, we, Africa,

167
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:28,240
in general, hasn't had a lot of time to develop skill and talent as much as the West or Asia has.

168
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,080
So, we're still playing catch up with the rest of the world. So, there's still a skills gap

169
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,240
that needs to be filled. I think once that is filled, we'll have developers, our community

170
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,240
members of the community in positions where they can contribute better. So, you'll find that most

171
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,360
of the contributions to open source, I think, don't quote me on this, but I think you'll find

172
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,000
that most of them come from economies that generally perform better than the rest of the

173
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,560
world. Economies that generally perform better, like Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, or Kenya.

174
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,400
So, the better infrastructure, better economies, and better levels of education, and better access

175
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:17,440
to hardware, and these opportunities. You have big tech companies setting up lots of startups.

176
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:26,160
So, it's a very difficult problem, but I think there's definitely lots of opportunity in

177
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:35,360
contributing to open source. I gained a lot from working in open source. I learned a lot of things

178
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,680
that I wouldn't otherwise have learned just from reading books or watching video tutorials. I've

179
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,280
had opportunities that came as a result of that, but the unfortunate truth is that it's not easy

180
00:20:47,280 --> 00:21:00,400
for everyone to get into it. I also sometimes wonder, because in the few interactions I've had

181
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:09,040
where during Hectorbofist, we as a community worked on this project that's ongoing, but

182
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:18,000
we kind of focused on it. It was incredible to find how unfriendly a lot of open source

183
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,520
tools and stuff is if you're on a Windows machine, for example, as opposed to a Mac or even Linux.

184
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,320
I think in Africa, it's probably more prevalent for people to have Windows machines than it is

185
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:43,440
to have Macs, for sure Macs. Maybe a lot of people don't know about Linux and also don't know which

186
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,360
are the more user-friendly installations of those that has a more Windows-like experience,

187
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,280
but will give you a better... Then, of course, Windows has come a long way in the sense of

188
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:03,120
a Windows subsystem for Linux, but you need to run the very latest version of Windows. That

189
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,560
sometimes means you have to have a pretty decent machine, so if you can't afford the expensive

190
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,720
computer, you can't run the latest Windows, and so you don't have access to WSL. There you go.

191
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,400
I think that might be another problem. You mentioned hardware access being one of the

192
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:32,720
problems. I wonder if something like an incubator for open source in Africa would go some way

193
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,960
towards this, because what I'm thinking is it's a means for young, and this is not young in age,

194
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:47,200
young and experienced people, to have a starting point where they get paid a decent enough salary

195
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:56,320
to work on open source, and through that, they then can get introduced to more opportunities.

196
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,520
So, the incubator serves as an on-ramp into the industry, so it takes people in,

197
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,840
it skills them up, and through skilling them up, they get paid, but they also contribute

198
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,040
to open source projects, which again, benefits a whole large part of the economy, because

199
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:21,280
everybody depends on open source these days, but then it gets them to a point where they can then

200
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,000
leave the incubator and either start their own thing or join a company, because now they've

201
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,960
experienced, and they could contribute to open source, because like you said, they can still

202
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,360
put food on the table, because they're actually getting paid to do that. What do you think about

203
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:45,280
something like that? I actually think it's a good idea, and I'd really prefer it if this came from

204
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:57,840
the highest level, say, have governments introduce open source policies, that would drive demand for

205
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,920
open source software. Say, for instance, the government were to stipulate that all government

206
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:12,080
departments would use open source operating systems and open source software, so that would

207
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,480
mean you'd have to have people skilled in installing these operating systems, in managing

208
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,360
these operating systems, and using the software, and it would save them money, which is a good

209
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,600
thing for government, because most of these tools are free, open source is free, and then it would

210
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:36,560
then create demand for people with skills in using or handling open source software. And then

211
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:43,120
these incubators would then have a pipeline, like you draw in the talent, you train the talent,

212
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,840
and you have somewhere to move that talent to, because there's demand on the other side.

213
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,680
So I think it would be to be a really good thing for all parties involved. Open source is free,

214
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:01,200
so that cuts costs, it creates opportunities for people using it, and then it's a win-win for

215
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:11,600
everyone. Yeah, yeah. I think it's a very good idea for governments to adopt this. My experience

216
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:30,240
is that it's a hard place to start. It almost feels like industry needs to, I don't know how

217
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,520
exactly this would work, but they have to kind of put pressure on the government to adopt these

218
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:43,840
things, because I'm not sure that the governments even know. They just pay the licensing fee they've

219
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,840
been paying for 20 years because it's what they've been doing. I don't know if there's enough.

220
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,120
There's a company in South Africa called Open Up, and they do quite a bit of this, where they

221
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:02,800
actually interface with municipalities and stuff like this, and they are very much into opening

222
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,240
up data, but also the use of open source and that kind of stuff. So I think it's kind of like an

223
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,160
education kind of thing, where there needs to be these companies that show government the benefits

224
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:21,600
of open source, and show the possibility of creating jobs and developing talent, and maybe

225
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:31,040
through creating something. Exactly, exactly. And maybe through setting an example, they'd be more

226
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,640
willing to adopt it, and you'd probably have to start on a small scale. You might have to start

227
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,760
with your own municipality and getting them to adopt some open source software, and then them

228
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,000
going to their leaders and saying, hey, my goodness, look, we've been using this thing that we learned

229
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,760
from these other guys, and it's saving us so much money, and there's a bunch of people that's being

230
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,200
trained, that knows how to run these things, and then maybe it goes up the chain and up the chain,

231
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,040
and eventually it gets adopted wider. I think there are some Asian countries that's actually

232
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:07,920
doing a really good job with this. For some reason, Taiwan always comes to my mind, but I'm not sure

233
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:13,920
if it's them who has really adopted a complete, and I think even South America, like Brazil and

234
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,960
them, I think they've also adopted open source software quite heavily. So I think there's scope

235
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,600
for that, and I do think that in the end of the day, that would be a good thing, but I do think

236
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:34,240
industry will need to set an example and offer proof that it's not just talk, it's for real,

237
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,200
like the benefits are real. But yeah, I think that that might be something that

238
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:48,160
would be nice if one can get a couple of companies together to try this out and see what one can do.

239
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:54,960
I think there are some education, some places doing education in South Africa, that is kind of

240
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,520
got this idea, but again, there you sit with the problem of the monetary problem, whereas

241
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,280
you're studying, so you're not earning anything yet. And so you have to, and that's definitely

242
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,200
a massive problem. I mean, unemployment in South Africa is something like 50%. So if you have an

243
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,560
unemployment rate of 50%, people don't have a lot of free time to give away of their precious time

244
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:28,160
that they have. So you have to incentivize them monetarily as well. So on that topic, yep.

245
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:35,840
I just want to say, this has a positive effect on people actually involved in work, that actually

246
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:42,800
use the software, because say a municipality needs a certain feature, they could have their employees

247
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:50,320
build the feature and then release it back into open source. So I mean, it's a hard problem to

248
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:58,880
solve, but it has lots of benefits if it would be implemented right. Yeah, no, for sure. And I mean,

249
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,640
and talking about that, I know you were a freelancer. I think you recently took a full-time

250
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:16,720
position. Yeah. Am I correct there? Okay, cool. Yeah. So to dig into that a little bit. So

251
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,480
in the beginning of this year, I officially started my own company. It's an open startup,

252
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,840
which means we are fully transparent in terms of income, in terms of what we pay people,

253
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,560
who our employees are. If the employee is okay with it, of course, we're not going to publish

254
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,400
their stuff publicly if they don't want us to do that. But so far, everybody's fine with that.

255
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:48,960
But our expenses, everything is open. And of course, we are heavily invested in open source.

256
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,960
The company is completely based around open source. We give back to open source.

257
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,120
We have a mandate of any project we rely on. We have to either financially or through

258
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:09,600
contributions give back. What's your product? So at the moment, it's mostly around consulting

259
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:17,200
and education, but we're building two products, one that's developer facing. It's called developer

260
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,600
tool chest. It's a way of collecting a bunch of tools that you use often and giving you easy

261
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,400
access to it. So you can just contribute to it, anything, and you tag it in ways that you'd

262
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,640
obviously want to find it later on. And then it's just like a search interface. And also allow easy

263
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,000
discovery of other tools you might not know about. And then we have some plans for going forward.

264
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The other one is called our backyard. And that is a platform to help small businesses

265
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,760
get in front of people. So it's easy to find big box stores because they have thousands of runs

266
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,320
to spend on advertising and big signs and big buildings. Whereas a lot of small businesses

267
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:12,720
run from their own little house and they don't have a bunch of money. And so the idea is that

268
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,840
our backyard is literally what the name suggests. It's where you go to find small businesses in

269
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:25,920
your own community and support local business in your own community. So it's got that good

270
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:33,440
thing to it. But then down the line, we will look at how we can responsibly make some money from it.

271
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:41,680
Because, of course, at some point, it needs to make a profit. But we want to do it responsibly.

272
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,040
So privacy is extremely important to us. So we don't want to stick a bunch of advertising

273
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,000
in front of you. We don't want to track you everywhere you go. But we'll find a business

274
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,120
model that works. Maybe it's something as simple as if this service is valuable to you,

275
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,120
to give money to it on a monthly basis. Maybe it's a business model like that. Kind of like

276
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,520
Open Collective. Because it's also built open source. The whole platform is built in the open.

277
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,680
But with that said, it's not easy. It's definitely not easy. And doing it in the

278
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:30,640
African context brings its own challenges. I heard a talk on a podcast of a guy called

279
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,000
Lex Friedman, where he spoke to a woman that she started a business in Lagos,

280
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,480
and then she started a business in the US. And she was talking about how different the

281
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,600
experience was between the two. And what it boiled down to was that in the United States,

282
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,480
with all its problems, the system is set up for you to succeed. Whereas, in her words,

283
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,600
in Africa, it's set up for you to fail. Because the infrastructure, the support,

284
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,440
it's just not there. More often than not, she got where she did because she knew the

285
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,280
mayor in the town and she could ask for a favor. Whereas if she didn't, you know,

286
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,760
she might never have gotten electricity to her business and the business would have failed.

287
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,560
All these kinds of things. So, I'm curious, because there's another thing,

288
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:32,480
because I know you struggled with this. So, if you're in a first world country,

289
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,160
and you want to experiment with something, so you want to create a newsletter, and then you want to

290
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,120
put some aspect of it, maybe you want to allow people to post comments on your newsletter,

291
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,400
but only if they're a paid member, for example. Now, there's an array of options to do that.

292
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:54,640
You can use Substack. You can use Ghost. There's a bunch of things. But if you're from Africa,

293
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:02,560
you're going to hit a problem. And that is because the only processor they support is Stripe.

294
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,880
And we don't have access to Stripe in Africa, in the entire continent we don't. Now,

295
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,160
Stripe offers this thing called Stripe Atlas. I don't know if you've heard about that.

296
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,920
Yeah, they create an LLC for you in Delaware, in the United States.

297
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:31,520
But the thing is, it costs $500 to get that set up, and then $100 per year to keep that LLC going.

298
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,800
Now, if you just want to experiment with a newsletter, that's a massive investment of

299
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,720
money for something you don't know if it's going to succeed, and where you're going to

300
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:47,280
charge people probably like $2 a month for a subscription. So, with all that context that

301
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:55,040
I've given now, what were the problems that you faced that made you, that put you in a position

302
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,480
where you had to say, you know what, I'm going to have to stop this freelance thing for a while,

303
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,720
and just get a paid job where I'm a little bit more certain of my salary?

304
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,320
So, before I started working as a developer, I used to run a web hosting business

305
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:23,440
for Hanger Branding for a few years. And the biggest problem I've faced was the changing,

306
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,840
like changes in business environment in Zimbabwe. The regulations are always changing. It's very

307
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:37,920
hard to plan for your business. And getting money into a bank account is very difficult,

308
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,920
because I think our currency has changed. I think we've changed currencies like five, four or five

309
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,640
times in the past few years. So, one minute we're using US dollars, next minute we're using

310
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:56,880
something different. So, that lack of consistency just made it very difficult. So, there were

311
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,080
problems that were bigger than me that affected the clients that I had. Everyone was affected by

312
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,160
this business environment. So, you'd have situations where clients weren't able to pay me on time,

313
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,480
or if they were able to pay me, I'd just have problems collecting the money. Because if you

314
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,440
have a client outside Zimbabwe, getting money into Zimbabwe is very difficult because of these

315
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,800
problems with our banking system and everything. So, that was the biggest problem for me is just

316
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:33,040
moving money. I had cash flow problems because of the changes and lack of consistency.

317
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,640
So, I'd say that was the first one. And then the second one, the second challenge I had is,

318
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:47,200
we have a number of payment options here. We have mobile money, we have bank transfers, we have

319
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,320
online payments from debit cards and credit cards. But getting support for all those is very

320
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:01,440
difficult. For instance, mobile money is run by a few telecoms companies, or the biggest one is

321
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:11,840
Ecocash. And they're not very open to providing their API to small businesses. So, if you're

322
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:17,360
starting out and you want to accept Ecocash payments or mobile money payments, it's not very

323
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:25,440
easy to get that. So, that's one of the first problems. And then the second one is the payment

324
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:36,080
processes we have here charge very high fees, just like Stripe does, the yearly fees. So, it can go

325
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:43,280
in the way, go against running the business because you end up paying more to these payment

326
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,840
processes that you're actually taking in. And then the last straw for me was the payment process I

327
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,720
was using at the time to shut down. No warning, no compensation, no communication, nothing.

328
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,640
It just shut down one day and it just stopped working. So, migrating the business to a new

329
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,000
payment process, it would have just taken too long. And you're like, hey, you know what,

330
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,240
I don't need this. So, that's when I notified all my customers. I just gave them free service for

331
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:20,960
about a year while I helped them move their websites to different hosting providers. And

332
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,720
that's when I was really done. Then I started looking for a job. So, yeah, it's hard to run

333
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,040
a business here in Africa because of infrastructure problems and the business environment is just not

334
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:43,200
set up for, that doesn't set you up for success. So, getting a job was another challenge because

335
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,360
economy in Zimbabwe is not great right now. And that was the first thing. And the second thing

336
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,120
was the skills I had learned where I couldn't get a job for the skills I had. So, I was forced to

337
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:03,040
get a remote job from international companies. So, that comes with its own challenges. But

338
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,800
unfortunately, I did get a job. I have a job now. I'm happy. So, yeah.

339
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:18,400
Oh, I'm glad to hear that. So, okay, let's step back into something else. There's a project that

340
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,120
I believe you started. And I believe I saw the tweet when this idea started in your head

341
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:32,160
that ended up being Pai Pai in a box. Yeah. Do you want to dig into that? Because that's

342
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,080
really, really cool. I read about it a bit more today and it's really cool if you want to tell

343
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:45,600
us more about that. So, what started this project is part of the problems we've been talking about,

344
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:51,360
infrastructure problems here in Africa. You go to a meetup, you're running a workshop, you want

345
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,560
people to install some packages, and then the internet goes out or the power goes out. So,

346
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,520
that basically means you can't do anything. You just have to talk through what you would have done.

347
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,240
So, I got to a point where I attend a lot of conferences and I attend meetups and workshops,

348
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:16,960
and I do trainings at these events. And that was my biggest frustration that I didn't have

349
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,120
a reliable internet access or reliable power to run the workshops I needed to run. So, I thought,

350
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:32,080
hey, what could I do to allow people in the workshops, guest attendees to install the

351
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,920
software and not be bothered by whether there's internet or not? And then I figured, what if

352
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,480
I could download the packages I needed onto a little computer, build, make it a Wi-Fi hotspot,

353
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,760
have everyone connect to it, and then they could download packages? So, that's when

354
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,560
I started tweeting about it, asking people how I could go about it. I did some research and I

355
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,880
figured it's actually not difficult because firstly, Raspberry Pi is an affordable computer.

356
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,200
At the time, they're still available, they're still affordable. You can buy, I bought one,

357
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:14,160
I got a very large, like the largest size SD card I could get. I think it was 256 gigs. And then I

358
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,040
cloned the Python package repository. So, it's like the NPM package repository if you're from

359
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:28,240
JavaScript world. So, that was about, the download was about 100 gigs. So, I downloaded the packages

360
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:36,480
and I found some software online that can recreate the structure of PyPI, which is the Python package

361
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:44,080
index. So, it recreated the structure and indexed the packages and then I put a web server in front

362
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:51,280
of that and then I configured the Raspberry Pi to act as a Wi-Fi hotspot. So, you can now, using

363
00:41:51,280 --> 00:42:00,000
this tool, install, do a pip install package name from a local repository instead of going to the

364
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,520
Python package index. You know, pip, the package manager can do that. It allows you to install from

365
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,240
offline or local package repositories. So, whenever we'd have an event here at Zimbabwe, I'd do that.

366
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,480
I'd set up the Raspberry Pi, everyone would connect to it and they'd run that one command,

367
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:26,560
they'd be able to install the packages that they needed. It's a, you know, it's a simple device,

368
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,640
but it's really went a long way in making sure I can teach the way I wanted to teach, you know,

369
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,280
whether there's internet or there's power, we always had a little Wi-Fi connection that could

370
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,200
allow people to install software. Yeah, yeah, that's super cool. So, do you put like a

371
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,600
a SIM card in the Raspberry Pi and it uses that to connect to the internet, like mobile?

372
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:57,840
No, so the Raspberry Pi, the model I have is the latest model. So, it has an Ethernet port

373
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:04,240
and it has Wi-Fi as well. So, the way I have it set up is I connect it to the internet via the

374
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:11,280
Ethernet port and then set up a Wi-Fi hotspot on its Wi-Fi adapter. So, I can download packages

375
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:19,040
using Ethernet and then broadcast Wi-Fi network using the Wi-Fi adapter. Now, alternatively,

376
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,320
you can download packages on your laptop and then transfer them onto its little SD card because it

377
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:30,000
uses an SD card as a hard drive. So, you can set up everything, all the files you need on your

378
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,480
computer on the SD card and then transfer that to the Raspberry Pi. So, it works just like a normal

379
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,920
computer except without all the fancy bells and whistles you'd expect from a powerful desktop.

380
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,520
Yeah, yeah, that's super interesting. I know there's another project. It's not meant for

381
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,600
Python or anything like that, but it's called Internet in a Box. I don't know if you know about

382
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:01,360
that. Yes, I came across it when I was working on this. It's a very similar project. They do

383
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:10,480
basically everything else. It's a digital library of different websites and stuff.

384
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,760
Yeah, like Wikipedia and that kind of stuff. So, if you're in a rural area, you can put that down

385
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,200
somewhere and people can have access to it. And then, if you once a month just do an update

386
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,880
from the internet to make sure you have the latest content, then people don't need internet

387
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,800
access to be able to access all this, which is amazing. I mean, sometimes the thing that stands

388
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:42,640
between you and success is just having access to that content. So, yeah, it's great. I'm actually

389
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,320
thinking of doing something similar. When I started this, it was just a proof of concept to

390
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:54,560
see if I could do it. But now, what I want to do is I want to take the same concept and use it to

391
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:02,080
make my own internet in a box. So, I only do Stack Overflow and Wikipedia. So, I found

392
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:08,880
a lab tool called Keywigs that allows you to do this very easily. It bundles all the software you

393
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:16,640
need to serve up clothed content offline easily. So, you just download the content, install this

394
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,320
software, and then it allows you to serve up some Wikipedia or Stack Overflow easily. So,

395
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:30,080
that's the next thing I'm going to try. Yeah, that sounds really cool. Do you know if there exists

396
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:38,080
a similar thing to this for NPM, like NPM in a box? I actually haven't heard anything like that.

397
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,800
So, I wouldn't know. I once asked on my Twitter, I've been on you, but I didn't get any responses.

398
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,880
So, I'm not sure if it's there or people just ignore me. I don't know.

399
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,320
Yeah. Would it be, thinking about your experience creating

400
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:58,720
PyPy in a box, do you think it would be a lot of the work you've done is transferable to

401
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,680
creating something like NPM in a box? With what you've done, would that have a lot of

402
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,880
the infrastructure just reusable for that, or is it very specific to PyPy?

403
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,680
I think it is. The concepts, rather, are reusable because I use a lot of Python packages to do this,

404
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,800
but I think the principles can be applied to NPM. I'm not sure how packaging works in the

405
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:32,320
JavaScript world, but I imagine JavaScript packages take up much more space than the

406
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:38,160
Python packages. So, you'd need to find a way to download packages that you can fit into Raspberry

407
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,600
Pi and then a way to index them and then serve them up. So, probably, for serving them up,

408
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,960
you could use a web server like Nginx or something, and then indexing them, I don't know. I'm sure

409
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,720
there's something NPM specific that you could do, but you just need to find the right tools,

410
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:01,520
but it should definitely be possible. Yeah. So, what do you use for indexing PyPy?

411
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:06,000
Because I'm thinking, the name is just in my head now, it's hard again.

412
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,920
So, there's this thing called PyPy server. You point it to where you have the Python packages

413
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,400
downloaded. It runs through the list and then creates an index. That makes it easy for the

414
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,920
PIP tool to find the package. You can find the package based on the name or its metadata.

415
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:31,520
You can figure out what dependencies it depends on. So, indexing really is useful. It saves you

416
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,280
a bunch of time instead of searching through the entire package repo every time you want to do a

417
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:45,440
PIP install. Yeah. I wonder whether Algolia or something like that, I wonder if you can run that

418
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:56,080
on a server with NPM and use Algolia to index the NPM registry. That'd be interesting.

419
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,320
I'm really curious if this is possible. Yeah, it could be an interesting problem to

420
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:07,600
solve. Yeah, for sure. Like you said, I'm sitting here and I was speaking to you and the only reason

421
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:14,240
I can is because I'm plugged into a big battery because currently we're being load shed. So,

422
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:21,840
we don't have electricity at the moment. So, I have a big battery that I'm plugged in and because

423
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:29,120
of that, I still have internet access and I can actually speak to you. I only bought it this week

424
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:35,440
and it was very expensive. I had to put money aside and thankfully, I have a business. So,

425
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:44,160
I did some extra work for extra clients and so far, it seems like it was definitely a good buy,

426
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,680
but it's not cheap and it's not something that's accessible to many people, unfortunately. So,

427
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,040
there's a lot of people around me sitting without electricity right now. So,

428
00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:02,720
I did that recently, so I can relate. Yeah. So, I can totally see a situation where you're in the

429
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,240
middle of a workshop and there goes the power and you're like, oh boy, now what do we do? So,

430
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,520
being able to whip out a Raspberry Pi with NPM on it would be super useful. So, I think it's something

431
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:20,720
that as Mechanical Ink should spend some time on and I might just need to tap your brain for some

432
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,240
knowledge. Yeah, I'm happy to. I'd love to actually see that, because I know that would definitely

433
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,040
have more of a use case here than the Python thing does, because there are generally more

434
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:40,240
JavaScript developers around than Python ones. Interesting. So, what I also saw is, I think,

435
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,360
maybe PyPy in a box presented an opportunity for yourself, because you recently gave a talk about

436
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:52,480
it at the Ubuntu Summit in Prague. Yes. How was that experience? So, what happened is, interesting,

437
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,200
I gave a talk about the same project in Namibia at the Python conference in 2020.

438
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,160
When did COVID start? 2020. Yeah, so I gave a conference. Yeah, the last conference I attended

439
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:12,640
was just before COVID started. So, in 2020, I gave a conference, a talk at Namibia, and one of the

440
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,560
community managers at Canonical was in attendance at the conference. He heard the talk and, hey,

441
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,520
that's actually a good idea. And so, this year, he invited me to speak at the Ubuntu Summit. So,

442
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:30,560
the Ubuntu Summit is a Ubuntu conference that seeks to invite community members and Canonical

443
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,000
staff, put them in a room together for a few days, and share stories about how people are using

444
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,240
Ubuntu and Linux and open source in general. So, I got to present about how I was using Ubuntu on an

445
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:49,280
Raspberry Pi to do that. So, giving that talk led to that opportunity to be invited to that conference.

446
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,040
And it was my first time in Europe. I'd never been to Europe, so I got to travel to Europe,

447
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:00,080
give the talk, meet fantastic people from the Canonical team. It was at a fantastic time.

448
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,960
Yeah, it's always great. I remember the first time I went to the US when I started contracting

449
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:16,000
at Mozilla. It was also like a complete culture shock. And you can understand how there's so many

450
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:23,360
tech companies because everywhere around you, like if you sit in a little coffee shop and you're

451
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,880
just talking, everybody around you are talking about their startup and about this problem they're

452
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,440
having with this program. And so, there's this energy in the air that's very, very contagious.

453
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,000
So, I was wondering with that conference that you were able to attend in Prague and now that

454
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,760
we're slowly walking our way out of the pandemic and starting to... But we've also learned some

455
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,680
lessons about the fact that in-person events are great, but it doesn't necessarily... The

456
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,240
world doesn't have to come to a complete standstill if we can't get on a plane and fly somewhere.

457
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:06,480
So, we can do a lot of these things virtually. So, do you think if we can install a more active

458
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:17,920
conference circuit, so to speak, in Africa, do you think that would foster a more active startup

459
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:25,440
culture? Because that's the one thing that I find is very, very active in Europe and in the US.

460
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:32,320
And I think a lot of great ideas come out of just this concept of trying something and being

461
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:37,440
willing to fail, but also being willing to pivot. But I do think, like I said, you have to have a

462
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:45,680
culture, you have to have an active community that encourages this. So, do you think if we can

463
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,520
somehow, maybe starting all virtually, because that's also cheaper than having to fly all over

464
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,680
the place and also better for the environment, do you think if we can install this idea of having

465
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,480
more Africa-focused conferences, speaking about stuff like what me and you have been talking

466
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,560
about now, the challenges and possible solutions, do you think if we can kickstart something like

467
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,680
that, that that'll, by its very nature, install this idea of a startup culture?

468
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:24,640
I think it would, because we all have similar problems, similar challenges we face. And I think

469
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,600
now physical conferences, like physical meetups, we actually work better than virtual ones, because

470
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:39,280
I think the networking opportunity that gives you allows people to just share ideas and talk about

471
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,000
problems. Some of the things that people talk about come up, even not in the conference talk,

472
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,080
but in the hallway track, or in the dinners, or in the lunches, whatever. It's like we can share

473
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:56,640
ideas and conferences or meetups are very good places to talk about stuff or to learn about stuff

474
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:04,000
you don't really know. Because when you're to the conference, you can learn something you

475
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,600
weren't aware that you didn't know. Like, oh, that could be really useful for this project that I'm

476
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:18,560
trying to solve. It allows you to make connections and to learn stuff. So I definitely think

477
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:26,240
that conferences would help, because we don't have enough conferences, I'd say, or meetups,

478
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:32,720
because most of the conferences I've seen are enterprise conferences where companies are getting

479
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:41,840
together. They're okay, but they have a bottom line goal most of the time. And I think we need

480
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:48,400
more community-focused conferences that just allow people to meet and share ideas and figure out a

481
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:55,200
way to solve common problems. So yeah, I think it would help. Yeah, 100% agree. Yeah, a lot of those

482
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:02,080
others are more trying to sell you their products and services than really fostering a community of

483
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:08,960
makers. So yeah, I agree. So you're an AWS certified cloud practitioner. By the way,

484
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:17,440
congratulations on having achieved that. That's no small feat. But I do see that you also use

485
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:24,640
a service called Devo. How do those differ or are they more similar than different?

486
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:36,960
I'd say one is an abstraction over the other. So Devo is an enterprise solution.

487
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:44,240
What their goal is to unify multiple clouds. So say you have a business, you want to put your

488
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,600
business on the cloud, but you don't want to deal with the complexity of choosing a cloud or you

489
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:55,360
want to put some information in one region or one cloud and whatnot, they take care of all that for

490
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:00,320
you. So they just provide you with a platform, you upload your code, and then you can choose through

491
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,840
a drop-down what cloud you want to put this on, what region you want to put this on, and then they

492
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:09,360
take care of all that. So you could actually have an app that has some data in Azure, some data in

493
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:15,200
Google, and then some data in AWS in a specific region. They can take care of that for you. So

494
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:24,560
I'd say that's how they differ. But at the end of the day, Devo does use AWS under the hood. Now,

495
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:35,280
if I were to release an app, develop an app, there'd be times where I choose Devo and other

496
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:42,880
times where I prefer to use AWS or another service. So Devo is mostly focused on enterprise. So you'll

497
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,680
find that their paid plans are quite pricey. I think they issued this plan, the last I checked

498
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:54,640
was like $150 a month or something. But they had a very good free developer plan. So if I was just

499
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:01,440
building a pit project that needed a home and URLs, load balancing, and a server, I'd use Devo.

500
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,800
It's a very easy platform to use. You download the CLI, you Dockerize your project, you just push

501
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:14,080
the basis. It's very similar to Heroku. So they have a nice platform, good documentation,

502
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:22,240
really easy to set up Dockerized applications and give them an online presence. But I'd say

503
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:31,360
AWS is, if I was running a business, I'd probably put my product on AWS or even Azure or any other

504
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:39,200
cloud, because you get more options, more fine grain control over what you spend your money on,

505
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:45,840
you know, AWS. So there's easy solutions to AWS. If you just want to get an application online,

506
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,960
there's solutions, you know, things like Elastic Beanstalk, you know, you can use

507
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,560
Elastic Beanstalk, just put up a website online and then Amazon will take care of auto scaling,

508
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:02,560
load balancing, security, provisioning, and all that. Or if you have more skills,

509
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:08,800
you can get a VPS. You can get a VPS from them and do all that yourself. So it really depends on

510
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,840
what you want to do, you know, how much time you have and how much money you're willing to spend.

511
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,960
Because obviously, AWS, like Elastic Beanstalk is more expensive because it's a managed service. So

512
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,600
you get a lot of things out of the box and you pay more for it.

513
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:35,200
Okay, interesting. So on that topic, I've spoken to somebody before, Chelsea Adams, and she

514
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,240
also does quite a bit of the AWS kind of stuff, but she also does front end and that kind of thing,

515
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:49,920
but she's well versed when it comes to AWS, for example. And I think one thing that she mentioned

516
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:57,200
that I found interesting, and it's true, most, I don't want to say all because that would be

517
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:06,640
unfair, but most of these bootcamps or even like longer term educational institutions that provide

518
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:17,520
specifically education around front end development, they stop short of, okay,

519
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:23,520
now I can build a React application, but how do I put it online? Maybe they'll show you how to do it

520
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,880
with like using GitHub pages or something like that. But I mean, if you want to do a production

521
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,400
app, that's not really, you know, the way you're going to go. And so the one thing that she

522
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:44,000
mentioned is there's a hole there that needs to be filled in the sense that there's not really

523
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,560
any good education, accessible, good education out there to teach front end developers, how do

524
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:57,280
I put this app of mine online the right way? You know, it's easy to put it online, but how do I

525
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,760
put it online the right way so that if I announced this on my social media network and some famous

526
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:11,200
person retweets my thing and 10,000 people hit my website, that is not going to go down. And also

527
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,240
that I'm not going to tomorrow morning wake up and somebody's going to say, why is there a bunch of

528
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:23,600
porn on your URL? Because somebody hacked your website. So do you have any like tips or good

529
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:29,760
resources or something that you can recommend to people if they want to like know how to do that

530
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:36,160
stuff the right way? I didn't know front end had this problem as well. I thought it was just a

531
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:44,000
Python problem. But yeah, deployment is hard, which is actually one of the reasons why I

532
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,880
got into DevOps. I wanted to learn more about deployment and how to do it and automate stuff to

533
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:58,480
make it easy. But in terms of general tips, I don't have any resources I can think of right now,

534
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:05,280
but I have a few tips that I'd like to give. Like there's certain things that I think

535
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,520
most people aren't taught in these boot camps about how to make deployments go well. The first

536
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:18,320
thing I think is to think about security from the get go. Don't start thinking about security

537
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:23,760
when you're ready to deploy. So that will help you avoid making mistakes that could later burn you.

538
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:30,160
So you mentioned that you're setting up a website and putting porn. People can do that. And one of

539
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:37,120
the reasons why some of these things are possible is say you put up your code in Git. So first thing,

540
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:44,800
learn how to use Git correctly. If your project doesn't need to be open source,

541
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:51,360
don't make your code publicly available. Keep it private. That helps hide mistakes you may have

542
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:56,880
made. Whereas if your project is publicly available and people can see information,

543
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,880
sensitive information, you don't want them to see that. That gives them keys to doing bad stuff on

544
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:10,000
your website. But in a more general sense, I'd say that the first thing to watch out for is just

545
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:18,400
make sure you handle credentials correctly. Like don't hard code passwords and credentials into

546
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:24,880
your code. That's easy to do when you're just mucking around locally, but you can forget to

547
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:32,400
remove that stuff. So don't put credentials in the code. And if you're using environment files,

548
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,880
try and avoid adding them to Git. Don't track them. Don't push them up to GitHub, wherever

549
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,160
you're pushing your code. So try and keep your code separate from your credentials.

550
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:50,560
So there are services you can use. You could use password managers to manage your passwords. You

551
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:59,920
can use password vaults that would inject the credentials into your environment while you have

552
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:07,760
it running locally, so that you never have your credentials available in an unencrypted text file,

553
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:15,120
for instance. So there's things like that. I think KeePass has an open source tool you can

554
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:19,120
install in your environments that can manage credentials for you. There's something called

555
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:26,560
HashiCorp Vault. You can install that on your server. It manages secrets for you. And then

556
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:32,240
once you're ready to deploy, I'd say make use of environment variables on the deployment server.

557
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:39,280
So whatever service you're deploying to, put your passwords there, the secrets and credentials there

558
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:47,840
instead of hard coding. So that's the first thing that would help reduce the risk of being hacked.

559
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:54,880
It's not the only thing, but it really helps. And then I'd say the second thing is,

560
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:05,520
if you can afford it, try and get a service that allows you to auto scale easily.

561
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:14,560
If you look at cloud solutions like AWS or Azure, there are tools that allow you to auto scale. So

562
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:21,760
if you put up your website and it gets popular, all those auto scaling solutions will allow your

563
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,720
traffic, will keep your website running even if it gets hit by like 10,000 requests or a lot of

564
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:32,800
people start using it. It will cost you money, but you won't have to think about it because

565
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:40,240
it's done for you. So if you can afford it, look into something like that. And then I think the

566
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:49,440
last thing I'd say is try and make your deployments repeatable. And I know for front-end

567
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,160
developers, this might mean learning some skills that they may not generally want to learn, but

568
01:04:54,160 --> 01:05:01,600
learn something about CI, CD and how that works. If you can get an automated deployment pipeline

569
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:10,960
going, do that because having that deploying code for you will allow you to run checks on your code

570
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:17,920
to make sure that the tool catches any errors you could introduce early before you actually do the

571
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:24,000
deployment. So you can look into that and try and make the deployments as automated and as repeatable

572
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:33,280
as possible. Yeah. So I think GitHub is doing a lot to make this more accessible through

573
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,760
GitHub, CI, CD, your GitHub actions and that kind of stuff. Do you use something like Terraform?

574
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:47,920
Not for the current project I work on, no. Okay. Yeah. I know it's some folks that Mozilla uses

575
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:54,640
Terraform and then Kubernetes, I think is one of the other things that people use. Yeah, I use

576
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:02,800
Kubernetes, but not Terraform. Okay. Okay. Yeah. But yeah, I think those are all great tips and

577
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:06,640
I would highly recommend people look that up and I'll add links to all of these things

578
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:15,840
when we publish this episode. So in closing, something fun. In your bio on your website,

579
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:22,000
you said you like cutting wood. Yes. Tell me more about that. Tell me more about that.

580
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:29,040
Okay. So software development is very stressful and you need an outlet to release that stress.

581
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,080
Cutting wood is a very good outlet. Wood doesn't complain. Wood can take a beating. So

582
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:44,080
I like to cut wood. But on a serious note, it's very similar to software development. You need

583
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:50,000
to think about what you want to make. You need to design what you want to build. You need to choose

584
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:57,120
the right tools and you need to follow a logical sequence of steps to get to make whatever it is

585
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:03,920
you want to make. And so it's a very, I'd say it's a good hobby to pursue if you're in software

586
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,400
development because many of the skills you learn, you know, from developing software are easily

587
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,840
transferable to woodworking. You just need to find the right tools, determine what you want

588
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:20,400
to build. Like I don't make any fancy furniture or anything like that. I can't do that. I make very

589
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:27,600
simple tables and desks, you know, like flat things, not flat corners, you know, but it's a really

590
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:34,640
nice fulfilling feeling to work on something you actually built yourself. Yeah, for sure. And like

591
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:40,080
I said, if you're stressed, you can hammer it with all day and all night because you're probably

592
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:47,600
going to make something good out of it. I really enjoy doing that and watching videos of experienced

593
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:55,040
carpenters and woodworkers doing DIY stuff. I'm really heavily into DIY. I believe every person

594
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,720
should at least know how to fix something. Yeah, for sure. So I really enjoy watching that stuff

595
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,840
and trying it on my own when I have the time. Yeah, yeah. I love those videos of the people

596
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:11,840
that do the woodturning where they have, you know, those big fancy machines that like take this

597
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:20,160
rough piece of wood and they just turn it and it's this beautiful shapes and just these gradients

598
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:26,560
that the colors of the wood forms. And it's so meditative to watch that stuff. It's just beautiful.

599
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:32,480
So I can imagine if, you know, if you can get to that point where you can actually do that

600
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,760
yourself, it'll be an amazing experience. But I think even starting with a pocket knife and a

601
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:43,440
piece of wood can be a nice start. Definitely, definitely. I have a friend who actually started

602
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:50,000
that way. You know, he used to make these little walking sticks and now he runs a business and

603
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,120
makes furniture. So you can start as a hobby and turn into a business. Yeah, for sure. That's great.

604
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,240
Well, thank you so much for this conversation. I really, really enjoyed it. It was

605
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:10,480
lovely to talk to somebody in Africa that shares a lot of the pain that I go through as well.

606
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:18,000
But I think you also have some unique challenges that we in South Africa might not always face.

607
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,600
But still, I think there's a lot of opportunities and I think we should connect more

608
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,320
and cross-pollinate. And I'm definitely going to hit you up about the whole NPM in the box.

609
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:33,680
I'm definitely going to contact you. And let's chat about that and make that a thing. I think

610
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:40,160
that'll be super interesting to do, but also super useful. So thanks so much for the conversation and

611
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,920
have a lovely rest of your day. And all the best for the future. And I'm looking forward to seeing

612
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,000
all the wonderful things you do. Thanks a lot. Cheers.
