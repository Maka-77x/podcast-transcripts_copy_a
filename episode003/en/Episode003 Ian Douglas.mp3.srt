00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Welcome to the Moxilion Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,520
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,640
Today we are joined by Ian.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,920
He's a developer advocate at Postman, the world's leading API platform.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,920
And according to his getup profile, Ian also considers himself a maker, teacher, lifelong

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,560
learner and family man.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Welcome, Ian, and thanks so much for joining me on the podcast today.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,200
Yeah, thanks for having me today.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,520
It's a pleasure.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,200
So I gave a brief introduction there, but I've looked up a little bit of all the things

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
you've done.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,680
So there's quite a lot to tell.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,200
Can you give us a bit about your background and who you are?

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Sure.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
I've been in the tech industry for about 26 years.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,760
I studied computer engineering in Canada, and I moved to the United States in the year

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:02,120
2000, mostly to get into more professional web development work and moved to Southern

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
California.

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,040
I lived there for a number of years, moved out to Colorado about almost a decade ago

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,880
and really love Colorado, it's pretty great out here.

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,000
But I've spent most of my career as a backend developer, but I've transitioned through various

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,040
kinds of stages as a developer.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,400
I've done DevOps duties, I've done QA testing, I've done everything from racking

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,920
servers, actually putting them in the server racks, all the way up to front end development.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,720
So when people talk about full stack development, I envision I can literally do everything from

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,160
running the network lines into the servers, system administration on the servers, installing

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:48,800
all the software all the way up through JavaScript in the browser and everything in between.

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,480
I ran a web hosting business for a number of years for small startups that really got

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,360
my interest in working at startups.

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,440
So a lot of my career has been small early stage companies.

31
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,960
But for the last, gosh, eight or nine years now, I've been doing career coaching for people

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,760
and just helping them understand how to get into the tech industry and how to find jobs

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,320
in the tech industry and focusing a lot on mentorship and education.

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,520
So over the last eight years or so, I've really pivoted a lot of my role into more of the

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,200
developer advocacy and developer education side of things and working on a lot of technical

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
curriculum.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Nice.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,080
That fits perfectly for our audience, both the people we speak to and the people who

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,520
listen to the podcast.

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,560
So I had a look at your GitHub profile and through that and your LinkedIn, I discovered

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,560
that you are behind the website, takeinterview.guide.

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,720
And this looks like an exceptionally good resource for our audience.

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,080
So for those who do not know about it, which includes me, can you please tell us more about

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,720
this resource?

45
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,840
So about eight years ago, when I started kind of down the journey of becoming kind of like

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,260
the idea of a career coach, I was mentoring for a code school in Colorado called the Turing

47
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,320
School of Software and Design.

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
And I mentored for them for about three years.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,000
We'll see just career development, how to build a resume, how to get an interview, how

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,120
to really stand out to a company.

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Throughout my career, I kind of progressed from senior engineer into the management side

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
and then back again.

53
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,160
So I've gone back and forth between management and hands-on contributor, all the way up to

54
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,820
like director of engineering type of roles.

55
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,480
And so I had a lot of perspective on how to really stand out to a hiring manager, what

56
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,440
I look for in resumes and things like that.

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,120
So I was turning around and teaching that to other people.

58
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
And then the school turned around and offered me a job as an instructor.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,360
And so I was actually teaching their backend software program for almost four years, but

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,060
also still helping with a lot of career development.

61
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,700
But by then they had hired a whole team of people to do the career development side.

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,200
And when I left there about a year ago, I wanted to still do a lot more around just

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,680
the scalability of making this information known to a wider audience.

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,440
So I put together the website tech interview guide.

65
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,800
It's been up for quite a few years now, but I've been gradually adding content to it.

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,560
And a year ago I decided, you know what, I'm going to try live streaming.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,520
So I live stream twice a week and you can find all that information on the website as

68
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,380
far as when I live stream.

69
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,740
But I live stream just career advice.

70
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,360
We do resume reviews.

71
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,880
We talk about what kinds of projects you should build, how to really stand out to companies,

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,320
you know, what goes into a good resume or CV, what should you leave out, stuff like

73
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
that.

74
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,120
And how to evaluate job postings, all kinds of fun stuff on the live stream.

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,760
And so yeah, so the website is kind of an, it's a start of that information base.

76
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,480
And then I kind of branch out from there into an email newsletter, YouTube channel with

77
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,300
lots of archive videos, as well as information to the live stream.

78
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,420
So however you want to consume content.

79
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,520
If you're a reader, there's lots to read.

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,120
If you just want audio, there's an audio podcast.

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,400
If you want videos, you can go to YouTube.

82
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,080
And if you want to interact live, you can come over to live stream.

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,840
So I want to try to cater to everybody's learning style for however you want or need to consume

84
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,920
that content.

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
I try to make that available for you.

86
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,480
I think that's actually critical.

87
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,160
Like for me, as I slowly start pivoting toward the education areas, that is something that

88
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,200
I definitely have top of mind is that there are so many different ways that people like

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,340
to learn.

90
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,940
And oftentimes you find a platform would focus on only one specific thing.

91
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,160
So then you kind of have to supplement the one resource with another resource with another

92
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
resource.

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,320
And then it becomes a little overwhelming.

94
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,220
I find when I speak to people, that's often a thing that I mentioned is one, I find it

95
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,240
hard to find a resource that caters to how I like to learn.

96
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,960
And two, there's so much that I don't know where to begin.

97
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,280
And once I started, I quickly get lost in the forest and I don't know, I lose my way.

98
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,640
So that is really interesting.

99
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,840
I love that you do that.

100
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,280
I also noticed on your Linktree page that you have got a interview.

101
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
I think maybe it's you that's running it or not sure, but it's an interview prep discord

102
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
server.

103
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeah, that's part of the techinterview.guide website as well.

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,200
So the discord server is really for the community to hang out, talk about projects.

105
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,360
I do resume reviews through the discord server as well.

106
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,160
But also I tell people, if you want to ask a question anonymously, you can DM me on all

107
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,800
these platforms, LinkedIn, Twitter, you know, discord and so on.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,720
And I put those questions in an anonymized way into a particular channel in that discord

109
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,820
server that I can draw from during a live stream.

110
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,640
Sometimes I can say, hey, things got a little quiet, people aren't chatting, or sometimes

111
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,760
I'll start the stream while people are joining the stream and I'll just go grab a random

112
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,520
question out of that anonymous questions channel and I'll answer that live on the stream.

113
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,000
And then I go back and I like clip those sections out and make smaller YouTube videos out of

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,540
just the question and the answer and things like that.

115
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,560
So the discord server is really just a place to support one another in the job hunt.

116
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,680
It's still a pretty small community, but at least on the discord side, we have about a

117
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,120
thousand people following on Twitch and we've got several hundred on YouTube.

118
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,320
And so more people are interacting kind of live on the live stream than, than they do

119
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,960
on the discord server, but that's okay.

120
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,640
Again, I just want to make it available for people that want that avenue of, of extra

121
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
help.

122
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Hmm.

123
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Yeah, that's awesome.

124
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
That's really great.

125
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,440
I think it will be a great place for the community that I'm also fostering to go for sure.

126
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,200
Because on the Mycelium Network one, we don't have specific like support for that part of

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,760
the getting into tech thing.

128
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,280
So I think it would be great for people to join that.

129
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,000
So we'll provide links to all these things in the show notes.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,160
So as a mentor, as a teacher, what advice would you give to folks new to the industry?

131
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,320
Like for early stage web developers, maybe how they can, you know, what they should,

132
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,480
shouldn't do and how to keep themselves motivated because I find that people start off being

133
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:25,160
super excited and then they kind of, it's like they hit molasses and they slow down.

134
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,320
What do you do when you hit those, those, those moments where it just feels like you're

135
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,000
getting nowhere?

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,320
I think it's important to understand when you're becoming unproductive in that struggle.

137
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,700
And when I taught, we would talk about productive struggle and unproductive struggle.

138
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,000
Productive struggle is where you're trying different things and you're gradually making

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,320
progress on a solution to something.

140
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,920
Unproductive struggle is where you find yourself kind of working in circles where you, you

141
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,580
find yourself trying something over and over again that you've already tried and you're

142
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,360
hoping for a different outcome this time, or you're trying to change too many things

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,400
and now it broke and you don't know why and you don't know which change made it.

144
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,160
So I think it's important to be patient with yourself.

145
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
You're still learning.

146
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,900
It's important to be patient.

147
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,800
It's important to give yourself, you know, kind of grace and flexibility of I'm still

148
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
learning.

149
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,020
It's okay that this is not working, but when you start facing that unproductive struggle,

150
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,540
that's the time to reach out to someone for help.

151
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,820
That's where you need to come to a realization that trying this, the way that I'm doing it

152
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,640
and the direction that I'm going, I'm not making progress.

153
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,920
I really need to ask somebody for help and have a community that you can reach out to

154
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,160
where you can ask for advice and say, I've tried this and I've tried this.

155
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
I've tried this.

156
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,960
None of this has worked.

157
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,640
What else can I do?

158
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,320
And I think that that's the important differentiation because especially with a lot of people that

159
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,320
are trying to learn remotely right now, they feel very alone and it's easy to give up when

160
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,080
you feel alone and that's why it's important to have a community of people around you that

161
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,520
can help you and support you in your learning goals and what you're trying to learn and

162
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:15,160
what you're trying to do and having that community be people who are also going through what

163
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
you're going through.

164
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000
So not just a community of people that can just hand you the answers, but people that

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,200
can work with you through the answer to try to understand why that's the answer.

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
That's the important part.

167
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,360
As an instructor, I had to be careful not to just give my students the answer.

168
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,680
I had to sort of coach them to find the answer themselves and say, well, what if you tried

169
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,440
this or what if you tried, you know, this and just kind of like point them in the right

170
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,480
direction and kind of give them a bit of a push.

171
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,660
Self-motivation is hard though, especially when you're learning online and you're learning

172
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:53,360
by yourself, it can feel very hard to stay motivated because programming is hard.

173
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,480
The initial learning curve is, it can be difficult if you pick up those concepts quickly, it

174
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,240
starts to feel easy, but everybody's going to hit a struggle at some point.

175
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
I still struggle.

176
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,960
I've been doing this for 26 years and I still run into problems and I'm still Googling answers

177
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:14,320
and looking at documentation on how do I do that date format thing again in this language

178
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,320
or that language or, you know, we all do, we all do, you know, nobody's got everything

179
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,560
memorized all the time.

180
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,920
And I think just understanding that things are constantly going to change in tech.

181
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,520
And so what you learned this year could change next year.

182
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,840
It could change five years from now.

183
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Like the way that I did programming 25, 26, you know, even 30 years ago when I started

184
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,440
college is completely different now.

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,520
We did a lot of low level programming, a lot of C and assembly and I haven't touched C

186
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,040
or assembly in many, many years.

187
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,400
I've dabbled in it a little bit when it comes to internet of things for controlling things

188
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,280
like the lights and stuff behind me or little motor circuits and things like that.

189
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,240
But I don't have to program at such a low level anymore and especially with a lot of

190
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,760
high level languages like Python and JavaScript and C sharp and so on that are out.

191
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,760
It makes it a lot easier to get into coding and see some really quick progress because

192
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,880
of the high level languages and what they offer.

193
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,140
But it's also very easy to get stuck if you don't understand the fundamentals.

194
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,480
So stick with it.

195
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,240
Know when to reach out for help and then find a good community that can, that can help guide

196
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,640
you to an answer, not just handy the answer.

197
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Yeah.

198
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Yeah.

199
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
That's good advice.

200
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,160
I have to constantly stop myself.

201
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,040
When people struggle with something, it's almost as if you feel their pain and you just wanted

202
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
to go away.

203
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,880
So you're just like, you just want to give them the answer, but you know that in the

204
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:44,080
long term that doesn't, that's actually worse than kind of guiding them into answering the

205
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
question themselves.

206
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:52,440
And I think that for me, I had somebody that's not a very good friend of mine who, when I

207
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,760
started about 11 years ago or so, would do that.

208
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,440
If I went to him for advice, he would kind of hint at what the possible answer could

209
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,080
be, but vaguely enough that I'd have to figure it out.

210
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,480
But at the same time, he would back that up with, I know you can do this.

211
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,440
Just think about it a little more and then if you still get stuck, come back to me.

212
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,560
But usually just that little morsel and that encouragement, that belief in me, you can

213
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,560
do this.

214
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,520
Just think about it for a second.

215
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,480
Those two things combined really made a difference.

216
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,320
And then when you find the answer, it's that moment when you just want to jump up and show

217
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
everybody, look, it works.

218
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
For sure.

219
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
For sure.

220
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Yeah, that's great.

221
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,880
And then you want to tell everybody about how you did it.

222
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,240
And I think those moments, I used to do that a lot more than I do these days, and I want

223
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,480
to get back to that is when you're in that moment where you're excited about this thing

224
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,480
you struggled with and then figured out, write about that, put all that excitement and all

225
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,000
that knowledge down somewhere, even if it's really, really rough, because then you can

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,640
go back and once you've calmed down and everything, you can read over it and format it nicely

227
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
and put a blog post.

228
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,080
Because I promise you, this is going to help a bunch of other people that run into the

229
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,160
same problem.

230
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,600
Talk through how you thought about this, your thinking process.

231
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,520
I think that's what a lot of instructional information misses for me is talking through

232
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,160
the thinking process.

233
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,920
Not just, this is the code you need to type out to make this thing happen, but how did

234
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,320
I come up with this code that makes this thing happen?

235
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,760
How did I reason about it?

236
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
What was I thinking?

237
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,120
What did I try that didn't work?

238
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,080
That is also important.

239
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:45,320
So yeah, I think it's great to don't give the answer.

240
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,360
Another good point about that, about writing up your experience, those make really good

241
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,160
blog posts on Medium or Dev2, all those kinds of platforms where other people are also trying

242
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,000
to learn and being able to document your journey also shows a good progression of your skill

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,800
over time as well.

244
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,200
Sometimes that can be the self-encouragement of, look how far I've gotten in the past year.

245
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,960
Look at all the things that I've done or even the past several months.

246
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,600
Look at the progress that I've made.

247
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,800
I think that that's important to do.

248
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,000
But from an employer's point of view, it's also nice for us to be able to see your progress

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,800
and how you've learned and what you've learned and so on.

250
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
But here's another tip.

251
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,320
If you really want to stand out to employers, take those blog posts, make a five minute

252
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,320
lightning talk about it and go to a local meetup and say, this is my experience with

253
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
such and such.

254
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,560
If you go to that meetup and you give a talk that says, here's how to use technology, whatever,

255
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,320
you're going to get a hundred people telling you why you're wrong.

256
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,280
If you go to that meetup and say, this was my experience learning this and this is how

257
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,560
I applied it, nobody can argue with experience.

258
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,300
At best they can come and say, next time try this, next time you could maybe try this or

259
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
try that.

260
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,240
And they're going to give you encouragement and they're going to give you other ideas

261
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,760
to kind of take that to the next sort of level and next steps.

262
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,680
But that also makes really good exposure for what we call discoverability of you as someone

263
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,120
in technology.

264
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,080
That's what employers are going to be looking for.

265
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,200
They want to find a way to find you.

266
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,240
And if they have an employee go back and say, hey, you know what, I heard this guy, Ian,

267
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,560
talking to this meetup, they're learning this and that.

268
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,120
They seem kind of clever and they worked on a pretty interesting project.

269
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,700
Now you've got people talking about you within a company or people are going to come up and

270
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,720
introduce you.

271
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,440
And if you end that lightning talk with like, by the way, I'm looking for a job.

272
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,840
People are going to approach you and say like, hey, we've got openings, right?

273
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,360
And now you've got people introducing you who have a potential opening at a company

274
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,680
who can maybe submit your application and so on.

275
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,600
And so it makes for very good networking as well to try to get those jobs intact.

276
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
Yeah, I totally agree.

277
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,960
And that is definitely a good way to get into it because I think in the beginning, your

278
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,360
CV is just going to drown in the pool of CVs.

279
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:11,320
I know it's some of the clients that I've worked with when they've advertised a position.

280
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,640
I mean, they get in the order of three, 400 applications.

281
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,540
It's so hard to stand out in such a large cohort.

282
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,920
But if somebody comes and says, by the way, so-and-so has applied and I've personally

283
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,720
seen them do some really good stuff on GitHub, I would really be sure to interview that person.

284
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
That helps you a lot.

285
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,600
And I think that's where contributing to open source is also can really be impactful.

286
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,480
I've had people contact me and say, I saw this and that contribution you made on this

287
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,120
and that open source project.

288
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,040
And it was really cool to see that.

289
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,480
Are you open to changing roles?

290
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,440
Because I currently see you here.

291
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,200
So that happens just naturally.

292
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,480
I didn't even have to go look for an opportunity.

293
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,440
The opportunity came my way and that is rare in this world.

294
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,680
Yeah.

295
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,040
Another good point about CVs and resumes, the way that you build your CV and resume

296
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,520
to stand out is to find out what that company cares about and customize your resume for

297
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
them.

298
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,160
So a common piece of advice that I give on my live stream is make a CV, like make a really,

299
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
really big CV.

300
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,120
Put every project, every technology, give me lots of bullet points about all the things

301
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,960
that you've done, all the things that you learned in that project.

302
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,520
Now you're not going to submit this big giant CV to anybody, but you're going to document

303
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
everything.

304
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,960
And this is going to kind of grow over time.

305
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,640
And so as you find work or you work on new projects, you're going to continue to add

306
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,440
to this.

307
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,020
There's a riddle that I learned as a child that basically says, how do you make a sculpture

308
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,040
of an elephant?

309
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,800
You start with a giant block of stone and you chip away everything that doesn't look

310
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,240
like an elephant.

311
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,480
And you can take the same approach with a CV where how do you look like the best candidate

312
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
for a job?

313
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,560
You start with an enormous CV of all of this information and you chip away everything that

314
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,400
doesn't make you look like the best candidate.

315
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,480
And so you take away the projects that that company doesn't care about.

316
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,540
You take away the technologies that that company doesn't care about.

317
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,600
You take away, you know, bullet points of previous jobs and so on so that you it's a

318
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,360
lot easier to just go in and delete things.

319
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,120
And so you make a copy of that big resume and you start taking away everything that

320
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,880
that company is not going to be impressed about, or it's not going to stand out to them

321
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,040
as much.

322
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,240
If they're looking for a Python developer who knows JavaScript and you know both of

323
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,520
those technologies, but they're looking for a Python developer who maybe also knows JavaScript,

324
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,440
then you're going to promote more Python projects and you're going to list Python as a primary

325
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,540
skill.

326
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,920
You also know JavaScript.

327
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,840
And so you might include one JavaScript project to kind of back that up if you've got that

328
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
range of technology.

329
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,300
Now, if you're new in tech, you're not going to have that breadth of knowledge and that's

330
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,080
okay too, but you can focus on the primary skills that they want and highly tailor that

331
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,720
CV to the kinds of projects that that company is going to care about.

332
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,400
And then, you know, you can bring that back down to like a one page, maybe at most a two

333
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,840
page CV and submit that because companies want to see in a hurry, are you going to provide

334
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,740
value and what kind of impact are you going to have at my company?

335
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,400
You want them to see that impact in a way that says, oh, I want that person on my team.

336
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,760
I want them to come here and do that too.

337
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,280
And so you have to be careful when you're writing up those bullet points of not just

338
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
saying, I did this, I did this, I did this.

339
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,680
It's like, okay, but what impact did that have?

340
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,360
Tell me what the result of doing that was.

341
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Like I wrote, you know, certain number of software tests.

342
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,960
It's like, okay, but how did that help?

343
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,920
Well, that increased our test coverage by 15%.

344
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,840
I did, you know, I refactored a bunch of code and that made it 5% faster.

345
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,320
Tell me the impact of what you did because that kind of stuff is going to stand out a

346
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,200
lot more to recruiters and hiring managers as well as seeing that impact.

347
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,480
But that highly tailored resume is going to stand out much more than people who are just

348
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,880
putting together a single CV and sending that to everybody hoping that, you know, it's like

349
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,920
casting the net and hoping you catch a fish, right?

350
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,040
You want to be very targeted with, I want to apply at this company.

351
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
This is what they care about.

352
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,720
Let me take all the stuff out of the CV, make a customized CV for them and submit that.

353
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,760
You're way more likely to get a phone call, especially then if you can also get people

354
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,360
in the company to say, Hey, I heard them talk at a meetup or I saw some open source by them

355
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,920
and get them to say your name.

356
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,140
They're far more likely to call you and get you into that interview.

357
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,000
And then it's up to you to actually pass the interview.

358
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yeah.

359
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

360
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah, for sure.

361
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,400
I remember when I applied for a job at Mozilla, I went as far as using their branding, like

362
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,600
their color scheme and the fonts and stuff they used.

363
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I made sure that I used the same color scheme and stuff like that.

364
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
And they called it out.

365
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,080
Like when they said, they said your cover letter was what made us look at you.

366
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,560
And then the rest followed on from there.

367
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,560
But that it was like in this sea of CVs, there was this one that was like, Oh, wait, that

368
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,040
looks like something we made.

369
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,600
It's like, Oh, wow, this guy actually looked at us and did the branding and everything.

370
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Yeah.

371
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
I saw someone do that.

372
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,640
Just this past week, somebody submitted a resume to look at and it was gray with light

373
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,040
green accents and so on.

374
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,640
Like it was kind of a medium gray with a little bit of white, but a lot of like green accents.

375
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,960
They were applying to Spotify and those are the colors that they use in their app.

376
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Oh, perfect.

377
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,800
And so it like stood out perfectly because it looked like the Spotify, like they didn't

378
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,080
lay it out to look like the Spotify app, of course, but they were using the same color

379
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
scheme.

380
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,480
Those kinds of things really stand out and let a company know, like I did this on purpose

381
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,960
because I care about your company.

382
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,360
Another tip that I often give people, if you're unsure what kinds of projects to build to

383
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,480
put on your CV, if you can find those companies where you want to apply, go see if they have

384
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,320
a technology or an API or something like that, that you can build into your project and put

385
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,120
that project on your resume because it looks a lot more impressive to say, Hey, I built

386
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,640
this with your tool or something.

387
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,580
It can also change that introduction a little bit from I'm Ian and I have these technical

388
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,920
skills to I'm Ian, I'm a user of your software and I like it so much.

389
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,880
I want to come work at your company and be a part of that.

390
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,520
It changes that introduction.

391
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,260
Now as an entry level developer, you don't often have like a, you know, a huge amount

392
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,120
of projects or a huge amount of time to just build dozens and dozens of projects.

393
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,960
But if you can find these little bits of technologies or libraries or something that a company

394
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,520
builds and uses themselves, something that they've open sourced, see if you can add that

395
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,800
to an existing project or you know, a couple of existing projects and put those projects

396
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,440
on your resume for it or CV for that company.

397
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,920
It'll really stand out to them to let them see like, Oh, you built like the three projects

398
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,280
that you put on your CV all incorporate our different technologies.

399
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,280
That's great.

400
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,220
Clearly you want to work at this company because you're targeting that kind of stuff for us

401
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,220
to see.

402
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,080
Yeah, that's great advice.

403
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,280
So like you said, you've been in the tech industry for a very, very long time.

404
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,360
What keeps you motivated?

405
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,680
What keeps you in this industry?

406
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,720
I almost left tech, honestly, back in 2010, I burned out pretty hard.

407
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,160
I was working at a startup where I was working a lot of hours and I was talking to management

408
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,200
at the time about, you know, like, Hey, I'm working on this really critical piece.

409
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
I'm the only one that knows it.

410
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,560
I need help on this so that I can like take time off and, you know, like stay recharged

411
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
and whatever.

412
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,920
And I just wasn't getting the help.

413
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,320
And so I burned out really hard.

414
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,360
I almost left tech, but I think what keeps me going is just my curiosity of how does

415
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
that work?

416
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
I want to know how that works.

417
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,520
I want to go build that myself.

418
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,280
And like even these, you know, I've, for those that are just listening, I've got a lot of

419
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,160
internet of things, lights kind of on a wall behind me.

420
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,040
And I've been learning how to program those through different APIs.

421
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,840
And part of it is just diving in on like, how does that work?

422
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Can I do that too?

423
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,500
Like, what would it take?

424
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,780
And just having that kind of curiosity of, you know what, even if I can't figure out

425
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,400
how to control these lights over a Bluetooth kind of thing, because the Bluetooth library

426
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,520
doesn't exist for this particular light, I would have to like go write my own Bluetooth

427
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
libraries.

428
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,880
Like that's a lot of low level code that I'm not sure I'm very well equipped to get into.

429
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,840
But it's going to be fun just exploring the process a little bit just to find out like,

430
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,080
can I turn them on or off with Bluetooth?

431
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,560
Like that would be enough to satisfy that curiosity and then I'll move on to the next

432
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
thing.

433
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,800
But in tech, there's so much change.

434
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,280
Like there's always going to be new, new languages, new frameworks, new libraries, new ways of

435
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,280
doing things, everything from, you know, what's, you know, what's been happening over the past

436
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,900
few years with web three and blockchain, you know, like things are drastically changing

437
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,080
around the tech industry and there's so much to learn all the time.

438
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,160
Now it doesn't necessarily mean that every technology that comes out is going to be great

439
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
and fantastic.

440
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,440
And you, you know, you go what we say, you go all in learning a particular thing, but

441
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,360
you can dabble in it just to see, do I like this or, you know, do I want to understand

442
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,040
it just enough?

443
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,200
An example with this is I've been primarily a backend developer.

444
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,600
I do consider myself full stack.

445
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,460
I'm not great at JavaScript on the front end.

446
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,760
So I wanted to take a course to learn react, not because I want to become a react developer,

447
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,800
but I wanted to understand how does react work?

448
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,120
Like what is a component?

449
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,640
Like when I hear people talk about react, I wanted to educate myself a little bit on

450
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,200
what is this technology and what are these words that they're saying.

451
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,800
And so I took a small react course just to learn about it and, and do a couple of small

452
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,000
projects and like, I'm not going to put react on my resume because I don't want to react

453
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,400
job and I can't speak enough to it in depth to go get a job doing react development.

454
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,880
But now I understand some of the technologies and some of the mechanisms of how it passes

455
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,460
data around and uses these components.

456
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,560
And so for me, what motivates me is knowing there's always something new right around

457
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,760
the corner.

458
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,280
And so in six months time, there's going to be something new in another six months time.

459
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,320
There's going to be something new that I can go explore just to learn a little bit, just

460
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,760
to see if I like that.

461
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,080
And over the course of my career, I've actually pivoted my career a little bit based on the

462
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,040
things that I wanted to go learn.

463
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,000
I'll dive in and I'll go explore that topic.

464
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,040
And then I might go find a job doing that.

465
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,800
I might go find a company doing that thing and explore what would it take to get a job

466
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,440
at that company, build out some projects that will stand out to that company.

467
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,960
And then I go get a job at that company and I'll work there for a year or two until that

468
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,680
curiosity is completely satisfied.

469
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,360
And then think about, okay, what else do I want to do?

470
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
What do I want to do next?

471
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,400
And that's what I love about technology.

472
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,920
It's a giant choose your own adventure where you get to choose what you do next.

473
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,040
And you don't have to feel like you have to stay in any particular area.

474
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,040
I hear from a lot of people like, well, should I get a QA job just to get into a company?

475
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,420
And then how do I transition into a programmer's job from there?

476
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,240
Because some people think that once you're in QA, you can only do QA.

477
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
It's like, no.

478
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,040
What you do is you start in a QA role and then when you go apply for that software role,

479
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,400
you make it sound like I did that on purpose because now I can write better software.

480
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,120
I understand now how all of these systems talk and communicate and how to test things

481
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,440
thoroughly.

482
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,560
I did that on purpose to make me a better developer and now I'm ready for a full-time

483
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,160
developer job.

484
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,980
And you obviously need to still be programming and stuff like that to show those skills,

485
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,240
but you can pivot from one thing to another.

486
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,280
You just have to have a story to tell about why you did that with intention to make you

487
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,160
better for this next role and why that's going to help bring value to that company in that

488
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
role.

489
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:51,360
Talking about career change and trajectories and all that kind of stuff, in your career,

490
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,360
maybe it was early on, maybe it was a key moment later on in your career.

491
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:04,400
Can you perhaps call out a person or event that happened that changed the trajectory

492
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,760
that your career was going in?

493
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,880
I think the one piece of advice that stood out to me most, and it didn't really change

494
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,360
the trajectory of what I did, but it did to some degree and really got me into doing more

495
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,760
mentorship.

496
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,560
When I was working at a company called SendGrid, which is now owned by Twilio, one of the founders

497
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,920
of the company is named Isaac Saldana, amazing guy, really, really friendly, really fantastic

498
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,920
person.

499
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,200
Gave me a piece of advice because he saw that I was taking on too much work because I was

500
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,760
so curious and I was so willing to jump in and dive in on different things.

501
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,680
He sat me down one day and said, Ian, humans are not scalable.

502
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,400
We built systems to be scalable.

503
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,160
We do automation to be scalable.

504
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,660
Computers are scalable, but humans are not.

505
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:57,400
You need to be careful with your time and you need to teach other people what you know.

506
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,560
This is basically what I learned from the conversation.

507
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,160
He didn't tell me go mentor people and go teach people, but he's saying you as a person

508
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,800
you have finite amount of hours in a day to get your work done.

509
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,040
You need to find a way of balancing what you do.

510
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:18,040
I realized from that what I needed to do was replicate what I know in other people so that

511
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,440
they can help and learning to trust that when I teach someone else to do something that

512
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,080
I need to be okay with just trusting that they're going to do the best job they can.

513
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,880
If something happens and needs to be cleaned up or whatever needs to be fixed or optimized

514
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,480
or something, then I can help optimize it beyond that, but I need to at least give them

515
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,760
the space and what we call agency to actually go do that.

516
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,120
That really kickstarted this whole idea of becoming a mentor.

517
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,600
It changed a lot of the trajectory of what I was doing at SendGrid at the time, which

518
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,920
then got me interested in becoming a manager, so I started exploring the management track

519
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
more.

520
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,160
I had been a manager previously, but this really got me into like, okay, I want to go

521
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,720
explore full-time management so that I can help coach other people's career direction

522
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,480
and so on from within a company of this is how you're applying your knowledge, but we

523
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,640
also need your knowledge in this or that area and really helping people kind of define and

524
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,360
refine what they wanted to do.

525
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:24,560
It really sent me on this journey about taking what I know and sharing it with other people

526
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,680
and then finding joy in their success because as a manager, you don't have that hands-on

527
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,880
contribution anymore of like, look what I did.

528
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,360
Your hands-on contribution is now, look what my team did.

529
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,720
You have to motivate them and learn what it takes to motivate other people and that inherent

530
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,360
motivation is very tricky sometimes.

531
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,760
Being a people manager is a very different skill set than being a hands-on programmer,

532
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,120
and so I went back and forth.

533
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,240
As I would do management, I would miss programming, so I got back into programming, then I missed

534
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,800
doing management, so I got back into management, and so I went back and forth.

535
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,020
Then when I got into education, I'm like, okay, this is the best of both worlds because

536
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:05,840
now I'm managing a room of junior developers and I also get to coach them, but I also get

537
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,600
to do programming and teach them the programming concepts and how to shape that career.

538
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,000
That's what really set me on this track of like, okay, this is who I am.

539
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm an educator.

540
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
This is who I am now and really helped to find that in myself.

541
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
Yeah, that's great.

542
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,760
I think that's a very healthy description of a manager's role.

543
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,240
I think a lot of people have the idea of what it means to be a manager completely wrong.

544
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,460
They kind of see it more as almost like a status thing like, oh, I'm manager, so I get

545
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,800
to boss people around.

546
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,560
It's like, no, no, no, no.

547
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,520
A true manager empowers others to be the best they can be.

548
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,960
You're not trying to be the hero.

549
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,160
I think that's also a thing that I've sometimes run into where people have a hard time handing

550
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,720
over something or bringing somebody else in because they want to be the one that made

551
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
the thing happen.

552
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,800
In sports, oftentimes the person who assists is way more important than the one who put

553
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,080
the ball through the hoop.

554
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,160
It's important to work as a team to reach that angle.

555
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:19,120
I think that's a very healthy approach and I wish more managers would have that approach.

556
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,480
Sort of in line with that, somebody said this and it's not 100% true, but they say don't

557
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,960
make people who want to be a manager a manager.

558
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,900
Look at what they do and if they inherently have managerial skills, offer them the opportunity

559
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,880
to explore the position.

560
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:45,860
So I think sometimes people who want to manage do it from a place of good like what you said,

561
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:52,280
but sometimes you do get people who think getting into a managerial is a way to control

562
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
people.

563
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,240
It's like just more control, so you have to be careful because that quickly creates unhealthy

564
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,320
working relationships.

565
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,640
Awesome.

566
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,040
So when you're not writing code, solving problems, what do you like to do in your spare slash

567
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,240
free time?

568
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,840
My free time right now, I'm spending a lot of time honestly on the techinterview.guide

569
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,560
website and rebuilding some of the content there.

570
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:24,920
I'm splitting a current newsletter that explores common questions that you'll face in an interview,

571
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,840
but explaining them from a hiring manager's point of view of why we ask those kinds of

572
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
questions.

573
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,720
I'm teaching you how to answer it perfectly, but it does let you understand why that question

574
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,440
is important to us.

575
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,680
There's a lot of content out there already on how to answer those things perfectly, but

576
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,440
I wanted to explore it from the perspective of this is why we ask these kinds of questions.

577
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,120
But I've had so many questions over the past year of live streaming around like how do

578
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,760
I prepare for interviews, how do I stand out in interviews, and just what is the interview

579
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,080
process that I decided I was going to split the one newsletter into four different newsletters.

580
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,720
So currently my free time is mostly encompassing, rebuilding a lot of that content.

581
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,080
But I also love video gaming.

582
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:09,400
I'm a big fan of exploratory kind of RPGs where you can just wander around the world

583
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
and so on.

584
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
I love video gaming with my kids.

585
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,400
I've got a Labrador Retriever that I like to get outside with and play with, but it's

586
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,360
a lot of family time, water parks, and there's lots to do in Colorado, lots of trips up to

587
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,240
the mountains and things like that.

588
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Yeah.

589
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Yeah, that's for sure.

590
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,600
I have a friend that also lives in Colorado, and I constantly see his stuff on Twitter

591
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:39,240
and Instagram, and I'm like, holy cow, it's like you have all the things.

592
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,480
In summer you have these beautiful hikes, and winter you like ice climbing, and canoeing,

593
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
and all these kinds of things.

594
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,840
It's like an amazing place to live.

595
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,000
A cousin of mine also lived in Denver, Colorado for a while.

596
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,840
She's in Hawaii now, which is like, oh, in Hawaii?

597
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,400
That's where you live now?

598
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
That's great.

599
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,560
But yeah, she as well, she was like, it's such a nice place to live.

600
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,960
The people are super nice, and there's just so much variety.

601
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,560
You can't get bored really.

602
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Yeah.

603
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Yeah.

604
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
It's really great here.

605
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
There's so much to do.

606
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,280
So yeah, whether we're going out for family bike rides or just a trip up to the mountains

607
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,800
or go on a road trip or something, there's lots to see and do around here.

608
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,600
Yeah, for sure.

609
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,400
Well, thanks so much, Ian, for joining me today.

610
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,200
This was really great to talk to you.

611
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,360
I think in closing, I'd like to know a little more about Postman.

612
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:34,080
I know what Postman is in essence, but I've never had anybody really explain to me exactly

613
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,920
what is Postman and how do developers use Postman?

614
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
Great question.

615
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,720
So Postman started as a way to test APIs, and specifically for RESTful APIs.

616
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,060
It started as a client of, let me put in this URL, let me go call that API and see the response

617
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,180
and so on.

618
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,720
Just as a way of understanding how do I then go implement this in my code.

619
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,600
So it was a way to sort of test that out.

620
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,760
But over the years, we've expanded it quite a bit.

621
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,600
We're up to version nine of the software now, and it does so much more now.

622
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,840
So we still have that testing component.

623
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,800
That's what we're most well known for, but we're actually a whole API platform where

624
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,520
you can go design and develop your API inside of the platform where you can go in and say,

625
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,720
I want to build a RESTful API that looks like this, and you can define all those endpoints.

626
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,000
And then it'll go build all those collections of requests that even if you haven't developed

627
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,980
the actual API yet, you can still plan and design what you want that developer experience

628
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,460
or the user experience to be.

629
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,120
Build out your documentation, build out all that test code.

630
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,360
And now you can use all of that as a test-driven approach or behavior-driven approach to actually

631
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,160
then go build the software yourself.

632
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,280
Some of what the application will now do is actually generate some scaffold code for you

633
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,880
for like Python, Go, Java, and JavaScript backends where it'll get you started on how

634
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,720
to go build that code.

635
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,120
But on the client side, when you build out all the documentation, it'll also build out

636
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:12,320
client snippets of lots of different languages, lots of different frameworks.

637
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,920
Like there's three or four different ways of how to call this in JavaScript if you want

638
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,640
to use fetch, or if you want to use jQuery, and so on.

639
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,000
Or if you want to use Python, you want to use the request library, and so on.

640
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,600
And so it'll also generate client-side code if you want to go build like an SDK or something.

641
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,380
Now you've got snippets of code to actually go call those endpoints.

642
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:35,320
And so the platform does quite a lot for both the consumer of the API, but also the producer

643
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,520
of the API.

644
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,160
And so a lot of what I'm doing is curriculum development, is teaching workshops about how

645
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,400
to do these deeper concepts within Postman and how to do these things.

646
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,280
So we have a whole program called Postman Space Camp, where we dive into these more

647
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,920
advanced topics of how to use the software at these deeper levels and how to understand

648
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,040
what is contract validation testing within an API.

649
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:01,360
Well, to start with that, you have to know what an API contract is.

650
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,880
But we've also done a lot of things around OpenAPI, which is the newer version of Swagger.

651
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,240
People are more familiar with the term Swagger.

652
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,600
OpenAPI is now the new version of Swagger, basically.

653
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,480
And so just a lot of education around what is OpenAPI?

654
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,320
What does it mean to be an API-first company?

655
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,040
So we're doing a lot of education around that.

656
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,000
So we've got lots of blog content, lots of video content.

657
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,640
We also live stream as a team almost every week as a developer relations team just to

658
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,880
help educate people on, here's a problem that we want to solve.

659
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,200
How can we solve that in Postman?

660
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,160
And we explore different APIs or we'll explore a technology like, what are webhooks?

661
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,360
Let's go explore what webhooks are and how we can use that inside of Postman.

662
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,680
And so we often do a lot of partnership kinds of things with different companies on the

663
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,040
live stream just to kind of hear about their APIs as well.

664
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,880
But as an application, we have both a desktop app and a web app that you can use.

665
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,600
And they all do the exact same thing as far as like building out the collections and so

666
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
on.

667
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,800
There are different limitations on both.

668
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,400
That's why we have both.

669
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,200
And yeah, we have quite a growing group of folks using it.

670
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,320
We just passed 20 million users on the platform a couple of months ago, so we're pretty excited

671
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,240
about how many people are using Postman on a regular basis now, almost to the point where

672
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,240
I'm actually starting to see it show up on resumes as a skill of, you know, I use Postman

673
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,960
for API consumption or API production and starting to see that showing up now as a skill

674
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
on our resume.

675
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
That's very cool.

676
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,840
Yeah, I'm glad I asked because I had no idea about the production side.

677
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,720
I thought it was just like, oh, it's a mock API thing.

678
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,080
It's like, no, no, it's more truth than that.

679
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
That's awesome.

680
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Yep.

681
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Thanks so much for sharing this.

682
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
This is really useful.

683
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:57,840
I will spread the word about Postman and that it's more than just a way to mock APIs.

684
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,160
And thanks so much again, Ian, for joining me on your Saturday.

685
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,840
