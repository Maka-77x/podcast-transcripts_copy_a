00:00.000 --> 00:06.680
Welcome to the Moxilion Network Podcast, a podcast all about early stage web developers

00:06.680 --> 00:10.520
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.640
Today we are joined by Ian.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.920
He's a developer advocate at Postman, the world's leading API platform.

00:16.920 --> 00:21.920
And according to his getup profile, Ian also considers himself a maker, teacher, lifelong

00:21.920 --> 00:23.560
learner and family man.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.560
Welcome, Ian, and thanks so much for joining me on the podcast today.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.200
Yeah, thanks for having me today.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.520
It's a pleasure.

00:31.520 --> 00:36.200
So I gave a brief introduction there, but I've looked up a little bit of all the things

00:36.200 --> 00:37.200
you've done.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.680
So there's quite a lot to tell.

00:38.680 --> 00:42.200
Can you give us a bit about your background and who you are?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.200
Sure.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.280
I've been in the tech industry for about 26 years.

00:47.280 --> 00:53.760
I studied computer engineering in Canada, and I moved to the United States in the year

00:53.760 --> 01:02.120
2000, mostly to get into more professional web development work and moved to Southern

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
California.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.040
I lived there for a number of years, moved out to Colorado about almost a decade ago

01:08.040 --> 01:10.880
and really love Colorado, it's pretty great out here.

01:10.880 --> 01:16.000
But I've spent most of my career as a backend developer, but I've transitioned through various

01:16.000 --> 01:18.040
kinds of stages as a developer.

01:18.040 --> 01:23.400
I've done DevOps duties, I've done QA testing, I've done everything from racking

01:23.400 --> 01:29.920
servers, actually putting them in the server racks, all the way up to front end development.

01:29.920 --> 01:35.720
So when people talk about full stack development, I envision I can literally do everything from

01:35.720 --> 01:41.160
running the network lines into the servers, system administration on the servers, installing

01:41.160 --> 01:48.800
all the software all the way up through JavaScript in the browser and everything in between.

01:48.800 --> 01:53.480
I ran a web hosting business for a number of years for small startups that really got

01:53.480 --> 01:55.360
my interest in working at startups.

01:55.360 --> 02:00.440
So a lot of my career has been small early stage companies.

02:00.440 --> 02:05.960
But for the last, gosh, eight or nine years now, I've been doing career coaching for people

02:05.960 --> 02:11.760
and just helping them understand how to get into the tech industry and how to find jobs

02:11.760 --> 02:16.320
in the tech industry and focusing a lot on mentorship and education.

02:16.320 --> 02:22.520
So over the last eight years or so, I've really pivoted a lot of my role into more of the

02:22.520 --> 02:26.200
developer advocacy and developer education side of things and working on a lot of technical

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
curriculum.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
Nice.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.080
That fits perfectly for our audience, both the people we speak to and the people who

02:33.080 --> 02:35.520
listen to the podcast.

02:35.520 --> 02:40.560
So I had a look at your GitHub profile and through that and your LinkedIn, I discovered

02:40.560 --> 02:44.560
that you are behind the website, takeinterview.guide.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.720
And this looks like an exceptionally good resource for our audience.

02:48.720 --> 02:54.080
So for those who do not know about it, which includes me, can you please tell us more about

02:54.080 --> 02:55.720
this resource?

02:55.720 --> 03:01.840
So about eight years ago, when I started kind of down the journey of becoming kind of like

03:01.840 --> 03:08.260
the idea of a career coach, I was mentoring for a code school in Colorado called the Turing

03:08.260 --> 03:10.320
School of Software and Design.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.320
And I mentored for them for about three years.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.000
We'll see just career development, how to build a resume, how to get an interview, how

03:16.000 --> 03:21.120
to really stand out to a company.

03:21.120 --> 03:26.120
Throughout my career, I kind of progressed from senior engineer into the management side

03:26.120 --> 03:27.120
and then back again.

03:27.120 --> 03:32.160
So I've gone back and forth between management and hands-on contributor, all the way up to

03:32.160 --> 03:34.820
like director of engineering type of roles.

03:34.820 --> 03:40.480
And so I had a lot of perspective on how to really stand out to a hiring manager, what

03:40.480 --> 03:42.440
I look for in resumes and things like that.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.120
So I was turning around and teaching that to other people.

03:45.120 --> 03:49.280
And then the school turned around and offered me a job as an instructor.

03:49.280 --> 03:54.360
And so I was actually teaching their backend software program for almost four years, but

03:54.360 --> 03:57.060
also still helping with a lot of career development.

03:57.060 --> 04:00.700
But by then they had hired a whole team of people to do the career development side.

04:00.700 --> 04:06.200
And when I left there about a year ago, I wanted to still do a lot more around just

04:06.200 --> 04:10.680
the scalability of making this information known to a wider audience.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.440
So I put together the website tech interview guide.

04:12.440 --> 04:17.800
It's been up for quite a few years now, but I've been gradually adding content to it.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.560
And a year ago I decided, you know what, I'm going to try live streaming.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.520
So I live stream twice a week and you can find all that information on the website as

04:24.520 --> 04:26.380
far as when I live stream.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.740
But I live stream just career advice.

04:28.740 --> 04:30.360
We do resume reviews.

04:30.360 --> 04:35.880
We talk about what kinds of projects you should build, how to really stand out to companies,

04:35.880 --> 04:41.320
you know, what goes into a good resume or CV, what should you leave out, stuff like

04:41.320 --> 04:42.320
that.

04:42.320 --> 04:48.120
And how to evaluate job postings, all kinds of fun stuff on the live stream.

04:48.120 --> 04:54.760
And so yeah, so the website is kind of an, it's a start of that information base.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.480
And then I kind of branch out from there into an email newsletter, YouTube channel with

04:58.480 --> 05:02.300
lots of archive videos, as well as information to the live stream.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.420
So however you want to consume content.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.520
If you're a reader, there's lots to read.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.120
If you just want audio, there's an audio podcast.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.400
If you want videos, you can go to YouTube.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.080
And if you want to interact live, you can come over to live stream.

05:14.080 --> 05:19.840
So I want to try to cater to everybody's learning style for however you want or need to consume

05:19.840 --> 05:20.920
that content.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.920
I try to make that available for you.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.480
I think that's actually critical.

05:25.480 --> 05:31.160
Like for me, as I slowly start pivoting toward the education areas, that is something that

05:31.160 --> 05:35.200
I definitely have top of mind is that there are so many different ways that people like

05:35.200 --> 05:36.340
to learn.

05:36.340 --> 05:40.940
And oftentimes you find a platform would focus on only one specific thing.

05:40.940 --> 05:45.160
So then you kind of have to supplement the one resource with another resource with another

05:45.160 --> 05:46.160
resource.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.320
And then it becomes a little overwhelming.

05:47.320 --> 05:54.220
I find when I speak to people, that's often a thing that I mentioned is one, I find it

05:54.220 --> 05:58.240
hard to find a resource that caters to how I like to learn.

05:58.240 --> 06:01.960
And two, there's so much that I don't know where to begin.

06:01.960 --> 06:08.280
And once I started, I quickly get lost in the forest and I don't know, I lose my way.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.640
So that is really interesting.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.840
I love that you do that.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.280
I also noticed on your Linktree page that you have got a interview.

06:15.280 --> 06:19.600
I think maybe it's you that's running it or not sure, but it's an interview prep discord

06:19.600 --> 06:20.600
server.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.800
Yeah, that's part of the techinterview.guide website as well.

06:23.800 --> 06:30.200
So the discord server is really for the community to hang out, talk about projects.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.360
I do resume reviews through the discord server as well.

06:34.360 --> 06:39.160
But also I tell people, if you want to ask a question anonymously, you can DM me on all

06:39.160 --> 06:42.800
these platforms, LinkedIn, Twitter, you know, discord and so on.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.720
And I put those questions in an anonymized way into a particular channel in that discord

06:47.720 --> 06:50.820
server that I can draw from during a live stream.

06:50.820 --> 06:54.640
Sometimes I can say, hey, things got a little quiet, people aren't chatting, or sometimes

06:54.640 --> 06:58.760
I'll start the stream while people are joining the stream and I'll just go grab a random

06:58.760 --> 07:05.520
question out of that anonymous questions channel and I'll answer that live on the stream.

07:05.520 --> 07:10.000
And then I go back and I like clip those sections out and make smaller YouTube videos out of

07:10.000 --> 07:12.540
just the question and the answer and things like that.

07:12.540 --> 07:17.560
So the discord server is really just a place to support one another in the job hunt.

07:17.560 --> 07:21.680
It's still a pretty small community, but at least on the discord side, we have about a

07:21.680 --> 07:26.120
thousand people following on Twitch and we've got several hundred on YouTube.

07:26.120 --> 07:30.320
And so more people are interacting kind of live on the live stream than, than they do

07:30.320 --> 07:31.960
on the discord server, but that's okay.

07:31.960 --> 07:36.640
Again, I just want to make it available for people that want that avenue of, of extra

07:36.640 --> 07:37.640
help.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.640
Hmm.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.640
Yeah, that's awesome.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.640
That's really great.

07:40.640 --> 07:47.440
I think it will be a great place for the community that I'm also fostering to go for sure.

07:47.440 --> 07:54.200
Because on the Mycelium Network one, we don't have specific like support for that part of

07:54.200 --> 07:55.760
the getting into tech thing.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.280
So I think it would be great for people to join that.

07:58.280 --> 08:02.000
So we'll provide links to all these things in the show notes.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.160
So as a mentor, as a teacher, what advice would you give to folks new to the industry?

08:08.160 --> 08:13.320
Like for early stage web developers, maybe how they can, you know, what they should,

08:13.320 --> 08:18.480
shouldn't do and how to keep themselves motivated because I find that people start off being

08:18.480 --> 08:25.160
super excited and then they kind of, it's like they hit molasses and they slow down.

08:25.160 --> 08:29.320
What do you do when you hit those, those, those moments where it just feels like you're

08:29.320 --> 08:31.000
getting nowhere?

08:31.000 --> 08:39.320
I think it's important to understand when you're becoming unproductive in that struggle.

08:39.320 --> 08:43.700
And when I taught, we would talk about productive struggle and unproductive struggle.

08:43.700 --> 08:48.000
Productive struggle is where you're trying different things and you're gradually making

08:48.000 --> 08:51.320
progress on a solution to something.

08:51.320 --> 08:54.920
Unproductive struggle is where you find yourself kind of working in circles where you, you

08:54.920 --> 08:59.580
find yourself trying something over and over again that you've already tried and you're

08:59.580 --> 09:03.360
hoping for a different outcome this time, or you're trying to change too many things

09:03.360 --> 09:07.400
and now it broke and you don't know why and you don't know which change made it.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.160
So I think it's important to be patient with yourself.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.160
You're still learning.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.900
It's important to be patient.

09:12.900 --> 09:19.800
It's important to give yourself, you know, kind of grace and flexibility of I'm still

09:19.800 --> 09:20.800
learning.

09:20.800 --> 09:27.020
It's okay that this is not working, but when you start facing that unproductive struggle,

09:27.020 --> 09:29.540
that's the time to reach out to someone for help.

09:29.540 --> 09:34.820
That's where you need to come to a realization that trying this, the way that I'm doing it

09:34.820 --> 09:38.640
and the direction that I'm going, I'm not making progress.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.920
I really need to ask somebody for help and have a community that you can reach out to

09:41.920 --> 09:46.160
where you can ask for advice and say, I've tried this and I've tried this.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.160
I've tried this.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.960
None of this has worked.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.640
What else can I do?

09:50.640 --> 09:55.320
And I think that that's the important differentiation because especially with a lot of people that

09:55.320 --> 10:00.320
are trying to learn remotely right now, they feel very alone and it's easy to give up when

10:00.320 --> 10:04.080
you feel alone and that's why it's important to have a community of people around you that

10:04.080 --> 10:08.520
can help you and support you in your learning goals and what you're trying to learn and

10:08.520 --> 10:15.160
what you're trying to do and having that community be people who are also going through what

10:15.160 --> 10:16.160
you're going through.

10:16.160 --> 10:20.000
So not just a community of people that can just hand you the answers, but people that

10:20.000 --> 10:25.200
can work with you through the answer to try to understand why that's the answer.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.600
That's the important part.

10:26.600 --> 10:31.360
As an instructor, I had to be careful not to just give my students the answer.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.680
I had to sort of coach them to find the answer themselves and say, well, what if you tried

10:35.680 --> 10:39.440
this or what if you tried, you know, this and just kind of like point them in the right

10:39.440 --> 10:42.480
direction and kind of give them a bit of a push.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.660
Self-motivation is hard though, especially when you're learning online and you're learning

10:46.660 --> 10:53.360
by yourself, it can feel very hard to stay motivated because programming is hard.

10:53.360 --> 10:59.480
The initial learning curve is, it can be difficult if you pick up those concepts quickly, it

10:59.480 --> 11:03.240
starts to feel easy, but everybody's going to hit a struggle at some point.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.240
I still struggle.

11:04.240 --> 11:08.960
I've been doing this for 26 years and I still run into problems and I'm still Googling answers

11:08.960 --> 11:14.320
and looking at documentation on how do I do that date format thing again in this language

11:14.320 --> 11:19.320
or that language or, you know, we all do, we all do, you know, nobody's got everything

11:19.320 --> 11:21.560
memorized all the time.

11:21.560 --> 11:25.920
And I think just understanding that things are constantly going to change in tech.

11:25.920 --> 11:29.520
And so what you learned this year could change next year.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.840
It could change five years from now.

11:31.840 --> 11:36.440
Like the way that I did programming 25, 26, you know, even 30 years ago when I started

11:36.440 --> 11:39.440
college is completely different now.

11:39.440 --> 11:43.520
We did a lot of low level programming, a lot of C and assembly and I haven't touched C

11:43.520 --> 11:46.040
or assembly in many, many years.

11:46.040 --> 11:50.400
I've dabbled in it a little bit when it comes to internet of things for controlling things

11:50.400 --> 11:54.280
like the lights and stuff behind me or little motor circuits and things like that.

11:54.280 --> 11:59.240
But I don't have to program at such a low level anymore and especially with a lot of

11:59.240 --> 12:03.760
high level languages like Python and JavaScript and C sharp and so on that are out.

12:03.760 --> 12:09.760
It makes it a lot easier to get into coding and see some really quick progress because

12:09.760 --> 12:12.880
of the high level languages and what they offer.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.140
But it's also very easy to get stuck if you don't understand the fundamentals.

12:16.140 --> 12:17.480
So stick with it.

12:17.480 --> 12:21.240
Know when to reach out for help and then find a good community that can, that can help guide

12:21.240 --> 12:23.640
you to an answer, not just handy the answer.

12:23.640 --> 12:24.640
Yeah.

12:24.640 --> 12:25.640
Yeah.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.640
That's good advice.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.160
I have to constantly stop myself.

12:29.160 --> 12:34.040
When people struggle with something, it's almost as if you feel their pain and you just wanted

12:34.040 --> 12:35.040
to go away.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.880
So you're just like, you just want to give them the answer, but you know that in the

12:37.880 --> 12:44.080
long term that doesn't, that's actually worse than kind of guiding them into answering the

12:44.080 --> 12:45.080
question themselves.

12:45.080 --> 12:52.440
And I think that for me, I had somebody that's not a very good friend of mine who, when I

12:52.440 --> 12:55.760
started about 11 years ago or so, would do that.

12:55.760 --> 13:02.440
If I went to him for advice, he would kind of hint at what the possible answer could

13:02.440 --> 13:06.080
be, but vaguely enough that I'd have to figure it out.

13:06.080 --> 13:12.480
But at the same time, he would back that up with, I know you can do this.

13:12.480 --> 13:17.440
Just think about it a little more and then if you still get stuck, come back to me.

13:17.440 --> 13:24.560
But usually just that little morsel and that encouragement, that belief in me, you can

13:24.560 --> 13:25.560
do this.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.520
Just think about it for a second.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.480
Those two things combined really made a difference.

13:29.480 --> 13:34.320
And then when you find the answer, it's that moment when you just want to jump up and show

13:34.320 --> 13:35.320
everybody, look, it works.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.320
For sure.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.320
For sure.

13:37.320 --> 13:38.320
Yeah, that's great.

13:38.320 --> 13:41.880
And then you want to tell everybody about how you did it.

13:41.880 --> 13:46.240
And I think those moments, I used to do that a lot more than I do these days, and I want

13:46.240 --> 13:50.480
to get back to that is when you're in that moment where you're excited about this thing

13:50.480 --> 13:56.480
you struggled with and then figured out, write about that, put all that excitement and all

13:56.480 --> 14:02.000
that knowledge down somewhere, even if it's really, really rough, because then you can

14:02.000 --> 14:06.640
go back and once you've calmed down and everything, you can read over it and format it nicely

14:06.640 --> 14:07.640
and put a blog post.

14:07.640 --> 14:11.080
Because I promise you, this is going to help a bunch of other people that run into the

14:11.080 --> 14:13.160
same problem.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.600
Talk through how you thought about this, your thinking process.

14:15.600 --> 14:21.520
I think that's what a lot of instructional information misses for me is talking through

14:21.520 --> 14:23.160
the thinking process.

14:23.160 --> 14:27.920
Not just, this is the code you need to type out to make this thing happen, but how did

14:27.920 --> 14:31.320
I come up with this code that makes this thing happen?

14:31.320 --> 14:32.760
How did I reason about it?

14:32.760 --> 14:33.760
What was I thinking?

14:33.760 --> 14:36.120
What did I try that didn't work?

14:36.120 --> 14:38.080
That is also important.

14:38.080 --> 14:45.320
So yeah, I think it's great to don't give the answer.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.360
Another good point about that, about writing up your experience, those make really good

14:48.360 --> 14:54.160
blog posts on Medium or Dev2, all those kinds of platforms where other people are also trying

14:54.160 --> 15:00.000
to learn and being able to document your journey also shows a good progression of your skill

15:00.000 --> 15:01.800
over time as well.

15:01.800 --> 15:06.200
Sometimes that can be the self-encouragement of, look how far I've gotten in the past year.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.960
Look at all the things that I've done or even the past several months.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.600
Look at the progress that I've made.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.800
I think that that's important to do.

15:13.800 --> 15:18.000
But from an employer's point of view, it's also nice for us to be able to see your progress

15:18.000 --> 15:20.800
and how you've learned and what you've learned and so on.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.800
But here's another tip.

15:21.800 --> 15:26.320
If you really want to stand out to employers, take those blog posts, make a five minute

15:26.320 --> 15:31.320
lightning talk about it and go to a local meetup and say, this is my experience with

15:31.320 --> 15:32.320
such and such.

15:32.320 --> 15:38.560
If you go to that meetup and you give a talk that says, here's how to use technology, whatever,

15:38.560 --> 15:41.320
you're going to get a hundred people telling you why you're wrong.

15:41.320 --> 15:46.280
If you go to that meetup and say, this was my experience learning this and this is how

15:46.280 --> 15:51.560
I applied it, nobody can argue with experience.

15:51.560 --> 15:56.300
At best they can come and say, next time try this, next time you could maybe try this or

15:56.300 --> 15:57.300
try that.

15:57.300 --> 16:00.240
And they're going to give you encouragement and they're going to give you other ideas

16:00.240 --> 16:05.760
to kind of take that to the next sort of level and next steps.

16:05.760 --> 16:11.680
But that also makes really good exposure for what we call discoverability of you as someone

16:11.680 --> 16:14.120
in technology.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.080
That's what employers are going to be looking for.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.200
They want to find a way to find you.

16:19.200 --> 16:24.240
And if they have an employee go back and say, hey, you know what, I heard this guy, Ian,

16:24.240 --> 16:27.560
talking to this meetup, they're learning this and that.

16:27.560 --> 16:31.120
They seem kind of clever and they worked on a pretty interesting project.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.700
Now you've got people talking about you within a company or people are going to come up and

16:34.700 --> 16:35.720
introduce you.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.440
And if you end that lightning talk with like, by the way, I'm looking for a job.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.840
People are going to approach you and say like, hey, we've got openings, right?

16:42.840 --> 16:47.360
And now you've got people introducing you who have a potential opening at a company

16:47.360 --> 16:50.680
who can maybe submit your application and so on.

16:50.680 --> 16:55.600
And so it makes for very good networking as well to try to get those jobs intact.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.920
Yeah, I totally agree.

16:57.920 --> 17:02.960
And that is definitely a good way to get into it because I think in the beginning, your

17:02.960 --> 17:06.360
CV is just going to drown in the pool of CVs.

17:06.360 --> 17:11.320
I know it's some of the clients that I've worked with when they've advertised a position.

17:11.320 --> 17:15.640
I mean, they get in the order of three, 400 applications.

17:15.640 --> 17:20.540
It's so hard to stand out in such a large cohort.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.920
But if somebody comes and says, by the way, so-and-so has applied and I've personally

17:24.920 --> 17:30.720
seen them do some really good stuff on GitHub, I would really be sure to interview that person.

17:30.720 --> 17:31.920
That helps you a lot.

17:31.920 --> 17:37.600
And I think that's where contributing to open source is also can really be impactful.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.480
I've had people contact me and say, I saw this and that contribution you made on this

17:41.480 --> 17:43.120
and that open source project.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.040
And it was really cool to see that.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.480
Are you open to changing roles?

17:47.480 --> 17:49.440
Because I currently see you here.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.200
So that happens just naturally.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.480
I didn't even have to go look for an opportunity.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.440
The opportunity came my way and that is rare in this world.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.680
Yeah.

17:58.680 --> 18:03.040
Another good point about CVs and resumes, the way that you build your CV and resume

18:03.040 --> 18:08.520
to stand out is to find out what that company cares about and customize your resume for

18:08.520 --> 18:09.520
them.

18:09.520 --> 18:16.160
So a common piece of advice that I give on my live stream is make a CV, like make a really,

18:16.160 --> 18:17.160
really big CV.

18:17.160 --> 18:21.120
Put every project, every technology, give me lots of bullet points about all the things

18:21.120 --> 18:24.960
that you've done, all the things that you learned in that project.

18:24.960 --> 18:29.520
Now you're not going to submit this big giant CV to anybody, but you're going to document

18:29.520 --> 18:30.520
everything.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.960
And this is going to kind of grow over time.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.640
And so as you find work or you work on new projects, you're going to continue to add

18:35.640 --> 18:37.440
to this.

18:37.440 --> 18:42.020
There's a riddle that I learned as a child that basically says, how do you make a sculpture

18:42.020 --> 18:44.040
of an elephant?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.800
You start with a giant block of stone and you chip away everything that doesn't look

18:46.800 --> 18:48.240
like an elephant.

18:48.240 --> 18:52.480
And you can take the same approach with a CV where how do you look like the best candidate

18:52.480 --> 18:53.480
for a job?

18:53.480 --> 18:58.560
You start with an enormous CV of all of this information and you chip away everything that

18:58.560 --> 19:00.400
doesn't make you look like the best candidate.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.480
And so you take away the projects that that company doesn't care about.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.540
You take away the technologies that that company doesn't care about.

19:06.540 --> 19:11.600
You take away, you know, bullet points of previous jobs and so on so that you it's a

19:11.600 --> 19:13.360
lot easier to just go in and delete things.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.120
And so you make a copy of that big resume and you start taking away everything that

19:17.120 --> 19:20.880
that company is not going to be impressed about, or it's not going to stand out to them

19:20.880 --> 19:22.040
as much.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.240
If they're looking for a Python developer who knows JavaScript and you know both of

19:25.240 --> 19:30.520
those technologies, but they're looking for a Python developer who maybe also knows JavaScript,

19:30.520 --> 19:34.440
then you're going to promote more Python projects and you're going to list Python as a primary

19:34.440 --> 19:35.540
skill.

19:35.540 --> 19:36.920
You also know JavaScript.

19:36.920 --> 19:41.840
And so you might include one JavaScript project to kind of back that up if you've got that

19:41.840 --> 19:42.840
range of technology.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.300
Now, if you're new in tech, you're not going to have that breadth of knowledge and that's

19:46.300 --> 19:51.080
okay too, but you can focus on the primary skills that they want and highly tailor that

19:51.080 --> 19:55.720
CV to the kinds of projects that that company is going to care about.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.400
And then, you know, you can bring that back down to like a one page, maybe at most a two

19:59.400 --> 20:05.840
page CV and submit that because companies want to see in a hurry, are you going to provide

20:05.840 --> 20:09.740
value and what kind of impact are you going to have at my company?

20:09.740 --> 20:15.400
You want them to see that impact in a way that says, oh, I want that person on my team.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.760
I want them to come here and do that too.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.280
And so you have to be careful when you're writing up those bullet points of not just

20:21.280 --> 20:23.520
saying, I did this, I did this, I did this.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.680
It's like, okay, but what impact did that have?

20:26.680 --> 20:29.360
Tell me what the result of doing that was.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.360
Like I wrote, you know, certain number of software tests.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.960
It's like, okay, but how did that help?

20:33.960 --> 20:37.920
Well, that increased our test coverage by 15%.

20:37.920 --> 20:44.840
I did, you know, I refactored a bunch of code and that made it 5% faster.

20:44.840 --> 20:49.320
Tell me the impact of what you did because that kind of stuff is going to stand out a

20:49.320 --> 20:53.200
lot more to recruiters and hiring managers as well as seeing that impact.

20:53.200 --> 20:58.480
But that highly tailored resume is going to stand out much more than people who are just

20:58.480 --> 21:03.880
putting together a single CV and sending that to everybody hoping that, you know, it's like

21:03.880 --> 21:06.920
casting the net and hoping you catch a fish, right?

21:06.920 --> 21:11.040
You want to be very targeted with, I want to apply at this company.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.040
This is what they care about.

21:12.040 --> 21:16.720
Let me take all the stuff out of the CV, make a customized CV for them and submit that.

21:16.720 --> 21:20.760
You're way more likely to get a phone call, especially then if you can also get people

21:20.760 --> 21:25.360
in the company to say, Hey, I heard them talk at a meetup or I saw some open source by them

21:25.360 --> 21:26.920
and get them to say your name.

21:26.920 --> 21:30.140
They're far more likely to call you and get you into that interview.

21:30.140 --> 21:33.000
And then it's up to you to actually pass the interview.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Yeah.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, for sure.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.400
I remember when I applied for a job at Mozilla, I went as far as using their branding, like

21:42.400 --> 21:44.600
their color scheme and the fonts and stuff they used.

21:44.600 --> 21:48.600
I made sure that I used the same color scheme and stuff like that.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.600
And they called it out.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.080
Like when they said, they said your cover letter was what made us look at you.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.560
And then the rest followed on from there.

21:56.560 --> 22:01.560
But that it was like in this sea of CVs, there was this one that was like, Oh, wait, that

22:01.560 --> 22:03.040
looks like something we made.

22:03.040 --> 22:07.600
It's like, Oh, wow, this guy actually looked at us and did the branding and everything.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.600
Yeah.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.600
I saw someone do that.

22:09.600 --> 22:14.640
Just this past week, somebody submitted a resume to look at and it was gray with light

22:14.640 --> 22:17.040
green accents and so on.

22:17.040 --> 22:22.640
Like it was kind of a medium gray with a little bit of white, but a lot of like green accents.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.960
They were applying to Spotify and those are the colors that they use in their app.

22:25.960 --> 22:26.960
Oh, perfect.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.800
And so it like stood out perfectly because it looked like the Spotify, like they didn't

22:30.800 --> 22:34.080
lay it out to look like the Spotify app, of course, but they were using the same color

22:34.080 --> 22:35.080
scheme.

22:35.080 --> 22:39.480
Those kinds of things really stand out and let a company know, like I did this on purpose

22:39.480 --> 22:41.960
because I care about your company.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.360
Another tip that I often give people, if you're unsure what kinds of projects to build to

22:45.360 --> 22:50.480
put on your CV, if you can find those companies where you want to apply, go see if they have

22:50.480 --> 22:55.320
a technology or an API or something like that, that you can build into your project and put

22:55.320 --> 22:59.120
that project on your resume because it looks a lot more impressive to say, Hey, I built

22:59.120 --> 23:01.640
this with your tool or something.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.580
It can also change that introduction a little bit from I'm Ian and I have these technical

23:05.580 --> 23:09.920
skills to I'm Ian, I'm a user of your software and I like it so much.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.880
I want to come work at your company and be a part of that.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.520
It changes that introduction.

23:14.520 --> 23:19.260
Now as an entry level developer, you don't often have like a, you know, a huge amount

23:19.260 --> 23:23.120
of projects or a huge amount of time to just build dozens and dozens of projects.

23:23.120 --> 23:28.960
But if you can find these little bits of technologies or libraries or something that a company

23:28.960 --> 23:33.520
builds and uses themselves, something that they've open sourced, see if you can add that

23:33.520 --> 23:38.800
to an existing project or you know, a couple of existing projects and put those projects

23:38.800 --> 23:42.440
on your resume for it or CV for that company.

23:42.440 --> 23:46.920
It'll really stand out to them to let them see like, Oh, you built like the three projects

23:46.920 --> 23:50.280
that you put on your CV all incorporate our different technologies.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.280
That's great.

23:51.280 --> 23:55.220
Clearly you want to work at this company because you're targeting that kind of stuff for us

23:55.220 --> 23:56.220
to see.

23:56.220 --> 24:00.080
Yeah, that's great advice.

24:00.080 --> 24:04.280
So like you said, you've been in the tech industry for a very, very long time.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.360
What keeps you motivated?

24:05.360 --> 24:08.680
What keeps you in this industry?

24:08.680 --> 24:13.720
I almost left tech, honestly, back in 2010, I burned out pretty hard.

24:13.720 --> 24:19.160
I was working at a startup where I was working a lot of hours and I was talking to management

24:19.160 --> 24:22.200
at the time about, you know, like, Hey, I'm working on this really critical piece.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.480
I'm the only one that knows it.

24:23.480 --> 24:28.560
I need help on this so that I can like take time off and, you know, like stay recharged

24:28.560 --> 24:29.560
and whatever.

24:29.560 --> 24:30.920
And I just wasn't getting the help.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.320
And so I burned out really hard.

24:32.320 --> 24:38.360
I almost left tech, but I think what keeps me going is just my curiosity of how does

24:38.360 --> 24:39.360
that work?

24:39.360 --> 24:40.360
I want to know how that works.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.520
I want to go build that myself.

24:42.520 --> 24:47.280
And like even these, you know, I've, for those that are just listening, I've got a lot of

24:47.280 --> 24:50.160
internet of things, lights kind of on a wall behind me.

24:50.160 --> 24:54.040
And I've been learning how to program those through different APIs.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.840
And part of it is just diving in on like, how does that work?

24:56.840 --> 24:57.840
Can I do that too?

24:57.840 --> 24:59.500
Like, what would it take?

24:59.500 --> 25:03.780
And just having that kind of curiosity of, you know what, even if I can't figure out

25:03.780 --> 25:08.400
how to control these lights over a Bluetooth kind of thing, because the Bluetooth library

25:08.400 --> 25:12.520
doesn't exist for this particular light, I would have to like go write my own Bluetooth

25:12.520 --> 25:13.520
libraries.

25:13.520 --> 25:17.880
Like that's a lot of low level code that I'm not sure I'm very well equipped to get into.

25:17.880 --> 25:22.840
But it's going to be fun just exploring the process a little bit just to find out like,

25:22.840 --> 25:25.080
can I turn them on or off with Bluetooth?

25:25.080 --> 25:28.560
Like that would be enough to satisfy that curiosity and then I'll move on to the next

25:28.560 --> 25:29.560
thing.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.800
But in tech, there's so much change.

25:31.800 --> 25:36.280
Like there's always going to be new, new languages, new frameworks, new libraries, new ways of

25:36.280 --> 25:41.280
doing things, everything from, you know, what's, you know, what's been happening over the past

25:41.280 --> 25:45.900
few years with web three and blockchain, you know, like things are drastically changing

25:45.900 --> 25:49.080
around the tech industry and there's so much to learn all the time.

25:49.080 --> 25:53.160
Now it doesn't necessarily mean that every technology that comes out is going to be great

25:53.160 --> 25:54.160
and fantastic.

25:54.160 --> 25:59.440
And you, you know, you go what we say, you go all in learning a particular thing, but

25:59.440 --> 26:04.360
you can dabble in it just to see, do I like this or, you know, do I want to understand

26:04.360 --> 26:06.040
it just enough?

26:06.040 --> 26:09.200
An example with this is I've been primarily a backend developer.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.600
I do consider myself full stack.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.460
I'm not great at JavaScript on the front end.

26:13.460 --> 26:18.760
So I wanted to take a course to learn react, not because I want to become a react developer,

26:18.760 --> 26:21.800
but I wanted to understand how does react work?

26:21.800 --> 26:23.120
Like what is a component?

26:23.120 --> 26:27.640
Like when I hear people talk about react, I wanted to educate myself a little bit on

26:27.640 --> 26:31.200
what is this technology and what are these words that they're saying.

26:31.200 --> 26:36.800
And so I took a small react course just to learn about it and, and do a couple of small

26:36.800 --> 26:43.000
projects and like, I'm not going to put react on my resume because I don't want to react

26:43.000 --> 26:49.400
job and I can't speak enough to it in depth to go get a job doing react development.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.880
But now I understand some of the technologies and some of the mechanisms of how it passes

26:53.880 --> 26:56.460
data around and uses these components.

26:56.460 --> 27:00.560
And so for me, what motivates me is knowing there's always something new right around

27:00.560 --> 27:01.760
the corner.

27:01.760 --> 27:05.280
And so in six months time, there's going to be something new in another six months time.

27:05.280 --> 27:09.320
There's going to be something new that I can go explore just to learn a little bit, just

27:09.320 --> 27:10.760
to see if I like that.

27:10.760 --> 27:15.080
And over the course of my career, I've actually pivoted my career a little bit based on the

27:15.080 --> 27:17.040
things that I wanted to go learn.

27:17.040 --> 27:20.000
I'll dive in and I'll go explore that topic.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.040
And then I might go find a job doing that.

27:23.040 --> 27:28.800
I might go find a company doing that thing and explore what would it take to get a job

27:28.800 --> 27:32.440
at that company, build out some projects that will stand out to that company.

27:32.440 --> 27:36.960
And then I go get a job at that company and I'll work there for a year or two until that

27:36.960 --> 27:39.680
curiosity is completely satisfied.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.360
And then think about, okay, what else do I want to do?

27:42.360 --> 27:43.360
What do I want to do next?

27:43.360 --> 27:45.400
And that's what I love about technology.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.920
It's a giant choose your own adventure where you get to choose what you do next.

27:49.920 --> 27:54.040
And you don't have to feel like you have to stay in any particular area.

27:54.040 --> 27:59.040
I hear from a lot of people like, well, should I get a QA job just to get into a company?

27:59.040 --> 28:02.420
And then how do I transition into a programmer's job from there?

28:02.420 --> 28:06.240
Because some people think that once you're in QA, you can only do QA.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.240
It's like, no.

28:07.240 --> 28:11.040
What you do is you start in a QA role and then when you go apply for that software role,

28:11.040 --> 28:15.400
you make it sound like I did that on purpose because now I can write better software.

28:15.400 --> 28:20.120
I understand now how all of these systems talk and communicate and how to test things

28:20.120 --> 28:21.440
thoroughly.

28:21.440 --> 28:25.560
I did that on purpose to make me a better developer and now I'm ready for a full-time

28:25.560 --> 28:27.160
developer job.

28:27.160 --> 28:31.980
And you obviously need to still be programming and stuff like that to show those skills,

28:31.980 --> 28:34.240
but you can pivot from one thing to another.

28:34.240 --> 28:39.280
You just have to have a story to tell about why you did that with intention to make you

28:39.280 --> 28:44.160
better for this next role and why that's going to help bring value to that company in that

28:44.160 --> 28:45.160
role.

28:45.160 --> 28:51.360
Talking about career change and trajectories and all that kind of stuff, in your career,

28:51.360 --> 28:56.360
maybe it was early on, maybe it was a key moment later on in your career.

28:56.360 --> 29:04.400
Can you perhaps call out a person or event that happened that changed the trajectory

29:04.400 --> 29:07.760
that your career was going in?

29:07.760 --> 29:12.880
I think the one piece of advice that stood out to me most, and it didn't really change

29:12.880 --> 29:18.360
the trajectory of what I did, but it did to some degree and really got me into doing more

29:18.360 --> 29:19.760
mentorship.

29:19.760 --> 29:24.560
When I was working at a company called SendGrid, which is now owned by Twilio, one of the founders

29:24.560 --> 29:30.920
of the company is named Isaac Saldana, amazing guy, really, really friendly, really fantastic

29:30.920 --> 29:31.920
person.

29:31.920 --> 29:36.200
Gave me a piece of advice because he saw that I was taking on too much work because I was

29:36.200 --> 29:40.760
so curious and I was so willing to jump in and dive in on different things.

29:40.760 --> 29:44.680
He sat me down one day and said, Ian, humans are not scalable.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.400
We built systems to be scalable.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.160
We do automation to be scalable.

29:49.160 --> 29:51.660
Computers are scalable, but humans are not.

29:51.660 --> 29:57.400
You need to be careful with your time and you need to teach other people what you know.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.560
This is basically what I learned from the conversation.

29:59.560 --> 30:05.160
He didn't tell me go mentor people and go teach people, but he's saying you as a person

30:05.160 --> 30:09.800
you have finite amount of hours in a day to get your work done.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.040
You need to find a way of balancing what you do.

30:12.040 --> 30:18.040
I realized from that what I needed to do was replicate what I know in other people so that

30:18.040 --> 30:23.440
they can help and learning to trust that when I teach someone else to do something that

30:23.440 --> 30:28.080
I need to be okay with just trusting that they're going to do the best job they can.

30:28.080 --> 30:31.880
If something happens and needs to be cleaned up or whatever needs to be fixed or optimized

30:31.880 --> 30:36.480
or something, then I can help optimize it beyond that, but I need to at least give them

30:36.480 --> 30:41.760
the space and what we call agency to actually go do that.

30:41.760 --> 30:47.120
That really kickstarted this whole idea of becoming a mentor.

30:47.120 --> 30:52.600
It changed a lot of the trajectory of what I was doing at SendGrid at the time, which

30:52.600 --> 30:57.920
then got me interested in becoming a manager, so I started exploring the management track

30:57.920 --> 30:58.920
more.

30:58.920 --> 31:03.160
I had been a manager previously, but this really got me into like, okay, I want to go

31:03.160 --> 31:07.720
explore full-time management so that I can help coach other people's career direction

31:07.720 --> 31:12.480
and so on from within a company of this is how you're applying your knowledge, but we

31:12.480 --> 31:16.640
also need your knowledge in this or that area and really helping people kind of define and

31:16.640 --> 31:18.360
refine what they wanted to do.

31:18.360 --> 31:24.560
It really sent me on this journey about taking what I know and sharing it with other people

31:24.560 --> 31:29.680
and then finding joy in their success because as a manager, you don't have that hands-on

31:29.680 --> 31:32.880
contribution anymore of like, look what I did.

31:32.880 --> 31:37.360
Your hands-on contribution is now, look what my team did.

31:37.360 --> 31:41.720
You have to motivate them and learn what it takes to motivate other people and that inherent

31:41.720 --> 31:44.360
motivation is very tricky sometimes.

31:44.360 --> 31:48.760
Being a people manager is a very different skill set than being a hands-on programmer,

31:48.760 --> 31:50.120
and so I went back and forth.

31:50.120 --> 31:53.240
As I would do management, I would miss programming, so I got back into programming, then I missed

31:53.240 --> 31:56.800
doing management, so I got back into management, and so I went back and forth.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.020
Then when I got into education, I'm like, okay, this is the best of both worlds because

32:00.020 --> 32:05.840
now I'm managing a room of junior developers and I also get to coach them, but I also get

32:05.840 --> 32:10.600
to do programming and teach them the programming concepts and how to shape that career.

32:10.600 --> 32:15.000
That's what really set me on this track of like, okay, this is who I am.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
I'm an educator.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
This is who I am now and really helped to find that in myself.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.960
Yeah, that's great.

32:21.960 --> 32:25.760
I think that's a very healthy description of a manager's role.

32:25.760 --> 32:31.240
I think a lot of people have the idea of what it means to be a manager completely wrong.

32:31.240 --> 32:36.460
They kind of see it more as almost like a status thing like, oh, I'm manager, so I get

32:36.460 --> 32:37.800
to boss people around.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.560
It's like, no, no, no, no.

32:39.560 --> 32:45.520
A true manager empowers others to be the best they can be.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.960
You're not trying to be the hero.

32:46.960 --> 32:53.160
I think that's also a thing that I've sometimes run into where people have a hard time handing

32:53.160 --> 32:58.720
over something or bringing somebody else in because they want to be the one that made

32:58.720 --> 33:00.720
the thing happen.

33:00.720 --> 33:05.800
In sports, oftentimes the person who assists is way more important than the one who put

33:05.800 --> 33:08.080
the ball through the hoop.

33:08.080 --> 33:12.160
It's important to work as a team to reach that angle.

33:12.160 --> 33:19.120
I think that's a very healthy approach and I wish more managers would have that approach.

33:19.120 --> 33:24.480
Sort of in line with that, somebody said this and it's not 100% true, but they say don't

33:24.480 --> 33:28.960
make people who want to be a manager a manager.

33:28.960 --> 33:34.900
Look at what they do and if they inherently have managerial skills, offer them the opportunity

33:34.900 --> 33:37.880
to explore the position.

33:37.880 --> 33:45.860
So I think sometimes people who want to manage do it from a place of good like what you said,

33:45.860 --> 33:52.280
but sometimes you do get people who think getting into a managerial is a way to control

33:52.280 --> 33:53.280
people.

33:53.280 --> 33:58.240
It's like just more control, so you have to be careful because that quickly creates unhealthy

33:58.240 --> 34:00.320
working relationships.

34:00.320 --> 34:02.640
Awesome.

34:02.640 --> 34:08.040
So when you're not writing code, solving problems, what do you like to do in your spare slash

34:08.040 --> 34:10.240
free time?

34:10.240 --> 34:14.840
My free time right now, I'm spending a lot of time honestly on the techinterview.guide

34:14.840 --> 34:17.560
website and rebuilding some of the content there.

34:17.560 --> 34:24.920
I'm splitting a current newsletter that explores common questions that you'll face in an interview,

34:24.920 --> 34:28.840
but explaining them from a hiring manager's point of view of why we ask those kinds of

34:28.840 --> 34:29.840
questions.

34:29.840 --> 34:33.720
I'm teaching you how to answer it perfectly, but it does let you understand why that question

34:33.720 --> 34:35.440
is important to us.

34:35.440 --> 34:38.680
There's a lot of content out there already on how to answer those things perfectly, but

34:38.680 --> 34:43.440
I wanted to explore it from the perspective of this is why we ask these kinds of questions.

34:43.440 --> 34:47.120
But I've had so many questions over the past year of live streaming around like how do

34:47.120 --> 34:51.760
I prepare for interviews, how do I stand out in interviews, and just what is the interview

34:51.760 --> 34:56.080
process that I decided I was going to split the one newsletter into four different newsletters.

34:56.080 --> 35:01.720
So currently my free time is mostly encompassing, rebuilding a lot of that content.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.080
But I also love video gaming.

35:03.080 --> 35:09.400
I'm a big fan of exploratory kind of RPGs where you can just wander around the world

35:09.400 --> 35:10.400
and so on.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.000
I love video gaming with my kids.

35:12.000 --> 35:17.400
I've got a Labrador Retriever that I like to get outside with and play with, but it's

35:17.400 --> 35:23.360
a lot of family time, water parks, and there's lots to do in Colorado, lots of trips up to

35:23.360 --> 35:25.240
the mountains and things like that.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.240
Yeah.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.240
Yeah, that's for sure.

35:27.240 --> 35:32.600
I have a friend that also lives in Colorado, and I constantly see his stuff on Twitter

35:32.600 --> 35:39.240
and Instagram, and I'm like, holy cow, it's like you have all the things.

35:39.240 --> 35:44.480
In summer you have these beautiful hikes, and winter you like ice climbing, and canoeing,

35:44.480 --> 35:45.480
and all these kinds of things.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.840
It's like an amazing place to live.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.000
A cousin of mine also lived in Denver, Colorado for a while.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.840
She's in Hawaii now, which is like, oh, in Hawaii?

35:53.840 --> 35:55.400
That's where you live now?

35:55.400 --> 35:56.400
That's great.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.560
But yeah, she as well, she was like, it's such a nice place to live.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.960
The people are super nice, and there's just so much variety.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.560
You can't get bored really.

36:04.560 --> 36:05.560
Yeah.

36:05.560 --> 36:06.560
Yeah.

36:06.560 --> 36:07.560
It's really great here.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.560
There's so much to do.

36:08.560 --> 36:12.280
So yeah, whether we're going out for family bike rides or just a trip up to the mountains

36:12.280 --> 36:16.800
or go on a road trip or something, there's lots to see and do around here.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.600
Yeah, for sure.

36:18.600 --> 36:21.400
Well, thanks so much, Ian, for joining me today.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.200
This was really great to talk to you.

36:23.200 --> 36:27.360
I think in closing, I'd like to know a little more about Postman.

36:27.360 --> 36:34.080
I know what Postman is in essence, but I've never had anybody really explain to me exactly

36:34.080 --> 36:38.920
what is Postman and how do developers use Postman?

36:38.920 --> 36:39.920
Great question.

36:39.920 --> 36:46.720
So Postman started as a way to test APIs, and specifically for RESTful APIs.

36:46.720 --> 36:52.060
It started as a client of, let me put in this URL, let me go call that API and see the response

36:52.060 --> 36:53.180
and so on.

36:53.180 --> 36:57.720
Just as a way of understanding how do I then go implement this in my code.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.600
So it was a way to sort of test that out.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.760
But over the years, we've expanded it quite a bit.

37:02.760 --> 37:08.600
We're up to version nine of the software now, and it does so much more now.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.840
So we still have that testing component.

37:10.840 --> 37:14.800
That's what we're most well known for, but we're actually a whole API platform where

37:14.800 --> 37:20.520
you can go design and develop your API inside of the platform where you can go in and say,

37:20.520 --> 37:25.720
I want to build a RESTful API that looks like this, and you can define all those endpoints.

37:25.720 --> 37:31.000
And then it'll go build all those collections of requests that even if you haven't developed

37:31.000 --> 37:35.980
the actual API yet, you can still plan and design what you want that developer experience

37:35.980 --> 37:38.460
or the user experience to be.

37:38.460 --> 37:41.120
Build out your documentation, build out all that test code.

37:41.120 --> 37:45.360
And now you can use all of that as a test-driven approach or behavior-driven approach to actually

37:45.360 --> 37:48.160
then go build the software yourself.

37:48.160 --> 37:53.280
Some of what the application will now do is actually generate some scaffold code for you

37:53.280 --> 38:00.880
for like Python, Go, Java, and JavaScript backends where it'll get you started on how

38:00.880 --> 38:02.720
to go build that code.

38:02.720 --> 38:06.120
But on the client side, when you build out all the documentation, it'll also build out

38:06.120 --> 38:12.320
client snippets of lots of different languages, lots of different frameworks.

38:12.320 --> 38:15.920
Like there's three or four different ways of how to call this in JavaScript if you want

38:15.920 --> 38:18.640
to use fetch, or if you want to use jQuery, and so on.

38:18.640 --> 38:22.000
Or if you want to use Python, you want to use the request library, and so on.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.600
And so it'll also generate client-side code if you want to go build like an SDK or something.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.380
Now you've got snippets of code to actually go call those endpoints.

38:30.380 --> 38:35.320
And so the platform does quite a lot for both the consumer of the API, but also the producer

38:35.320 --> 38:36.520
of the API.

38:36.520 --> 38:41.160
And so a lot of what I'm doing is curriculum development, is teaching workshops about how

38:41.160 --> 38:44.400
to do these deeper concepts within Postman and how to do these things.

38:44.400 --> 38:49.280
So we have a whole program called Postman Space Camp, where we dive into these more

38:49.280 --> 38:54.920
advanced topics of how to use the software at these deeper levels and how to understand

38:54.920 --> 38:58.040
what is contract validation testing within an API.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.360
Well, to start with that, you have to know what an API contract is.

39:01.360 --> 39:05.880
But we've also done a lot of things around OpenAPI, which is the newer version of Swagger.

39:05.880 --> 39:09.240
People are more familiar with the term Swagger.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.600
OpenAPI is now the new version of Swagger, basically.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.480
And so just a lot of education around what is OpenAPI?

39:16.480 --> 39:19.320
What does it mean to be an API-first company?

39:19.320 --> 39:21.040
So we're doing a lot of education around that.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.000
So we've got lots of blog content, lots of video content.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.640
We also live stream as a team almost every week as a developer relations team just to

39:28.640 --> 39:31.880
help educate people on, here's a problem that we want to solve.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.200
How can we solve that in Postman?

39:34.200 --> 39:39.160
And we explore different APIs or we'll explore a technology like, what are webhooks?

39:39.160 --> 39:44.360
Let's go explore what webhooks are and how we can use that inside of Postman.

39:44.360 --> 39:50.680
And so we often do a lot of partnership kinds of things with different companies on the

39:50.680 --> 39:54.040
live stream just to kind of hear about their APIs as well.

39:54.040 --> 39:58.880
But as an application, we have both a desktop app and a web app that you can use.

39:58.880 --> 40:03.600
And they all do the exact same thing as far as like building out the collections and so

40:03.600 --> 40:04.600
on.

40:04.600 --> 40:05.800
There are different limitations on both.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.400
That's why we have both.

40:07.400 --> 40:12.200
And yeah, we have quite a growing group of folks using it.

40:12.200 --> 40:17.320
We just passed 20 million users on the platform a couple of months ago, so we're pretty excited

40:17.320 --> 40:21.240
about how many people are using Postman on a regular basis now, almost to the point where

40:21.240 --> 40:26.240
I'm actually starting to see it show up on resumes as a skill of, you know, I use Postman

40:26.240 --> 40:31.960
for API consumption or API production and starting to see that showing up now as a skill

40:31.960 --> 40:32.960
on our resume.

40:32.960 --> 40:33.960
That's very cool.

40:33.960 --> 40:38.840
Yeah, I'm glad I asked because I had no idea about the production side.

40:38.840 --> 40:42.720
I thought it was just like, oh, it's a mock API thing.

40:42.720 --> 40:45.080
It's like, no, no, it's more truth than that.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.080
That's awesome.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.080
Yep.

40:47.080 --> 40:50.080
Thanks so much for sharing this.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.080
This is really useful.

40:51.080 --> 40:57.840
I will spread the word about Postman and that it's more than just a way to mock APIs.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.160
And thanks so much again, Ian, for joining me on your Saturday.

41:01.160 --> 41:02.840
I really appreciate it.

41:02.840 --> 41:08.680
