00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Welcome to the Marseillean Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

00:06.640 --> 00:09.760
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.200
Hey, Alvin.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.000
Thank you so much for joining me today on this Thursday.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.880
I'm always supposed to be on track for time this week.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.880
Thanks so much for joining me.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.440
I'm really looking forward to our conversation.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.440
I am too.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.440
Thank you so much for having me on.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.440
Yeah, pleasure.

00:24.440 --> 00:29.640
So, as I start with all my guests, I'm not going to tell your story.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.000
I think you can do it better than I can.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.800
So instead of that, I'm going to give you the floor and take as much time as you need,

00:35.800 --> 00:36.800
as I always say.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.400
Go as far back into your history as you'd like and bring us up to the current day and

00:40.400 --> 00:42.760
just tell us a bit more about you.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.760
For sure.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.480
So, hey, I'm Alvin.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.880
I've been in the industry for a while.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.520
Primarily, I worked as a front-end type person.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.720
So I was always driven by the same idea of like, how can I make like things that look

00:57.720 --> 01:04.680
and feel nice to the user so that whether it's beautiful, fun, entertaining.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.520
And that took like a few forms, I guess.

01:07.520 --> 01:15.600
I worked on games, I worked on data visualizations, I worked on most recently designed systems.

01:15.600 --> 01:21.720
And now, a new sort of turn in my career is I've been, since the month of May this year,

01:21.720 --> 01:26.160
so about four months, four or five months, a developer advocate at Contentful.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.160
Cool.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.160
Yeah.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.160
I like the design systems angle.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.040
I wonder if you want to dig into that a little bit, because I know that is something that

01:32.040 --> 01:33.320
I'm pretty passionate about.

01:33.320 --> 01:38.120
I had a couple of clients that I was at.

01:38.120 --> 01:43.120
They were playing very fast and loose with their brand.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.560
And it's not, you know, it's not their fault if there isn't any structure.

01:46.560 --> 01:52.360
But then, if you approach them as this idea of a design system, they're a little hesitant

01:52.360 --> 01:54.880
because they're like, how much time is this going to take?

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
I was like...

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
Always.

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
What's the...

01:57.880 --> 01:58.880
What's the value of it?

01:58.880 --> 01:59.880
You know?

01:59.880 --> 02:00.880
Yeah.

02:00.880 --> 02:01.880
It's going to take a little bit of time.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.480
But just let me paint you a picture of the future and what it might be like once you

02:05.480 --> 02:06.480
have this thing in place.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.880
Do you want to dig a little bit more into design systems and what they are and maybe

02:10.880 --> 02:13.400
even try and answer some of those questions?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.960
Yeah, for sure.

02:14.960 --> 02:22.880
So for me, I guess what interested me in design systems is that it's the place where developers

02:22.880 --> 02:26.040
and designers have to collaborate, right?

02:26.040 --> 02:27.040
It's like...

02:27.040 --> 02:31.680
And that's always been the sweet spot for me, where the more design-driven something

02:31.680 --> 02:33.760
is, usually the more I like it.

02:33.760 --> 02:39.840
And I found that design systems were this, but at the larger scale.

02:39.840 --> 02:45.440
As much as I was interested in very large, complex front ends that had lots of moving

02:45.440 --> 02:51.320
parts with 50 people working on something, a design system, on the other hand, is much

02:51.320 --> 02:56.800
more interesting because you have your designers and your developers working together in making

02:56.800 --> 02:58.800
something, right?

02:58.800 --> 03:01.400
And that was always the cool thing for me.

03:01.400 --> 03:08.800
In terms of, again, application for the brand, when a design system is well put together,

03:08.800 --> 03:14.000
it's just really satisfying when you can create a sub page or a landing page really quickly

03:14.000 --> 03:17.120
because you're just putting blocks together and then you're like, okay, I've got the boring

03:17.120 --> 03:25.880
bits, done, and now I can focus on the more bespoke, interactive, interesting things.

03:25.880 --> 03:31.520
Otherwise, if you're always trying to find the same nav and the same sub menu or whatever

03:31.520 --> 03:37.400
and you're having to code that or just lift and shift that in a non-standard way, you

03:37.400 --> 03:41.320
can just waste a bunch of time recoding the same things.

03:41.320 --> 03:45.360
Whereas if you have everything that's ready, you could just say, okay, put the blocks together,

03:45.360 --> 03:47.680
boom, nav, boom, headings.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.680
Everything has the right font size, the right spacing.

03:49.680 --> 03:54.760
You don't have to peer into Figma too much or Sketch or whatever, but everything's already

03:54.760 --> 03:55.760
done for you.

03:55.760 --> 04:00.320
So everything is neat and tidy very quickly.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.360
But the bespoke bit that you need, then you have more time for it.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.400
Did that make any sense?

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400
100%.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.760
No, 100% agree.

04:08.760 --> 04:13.840
I think that is one of the big things about the design system because it's not just the

04:13.840 --> 04:17.640
design, it's also the components that comes out of the design.

04:17.640 --> 04:23.320
And those are actual living, breathing pieces of code that you can then compose together.

04:23.320 --> 04:29.000
And I think maybe React was the framework that really started making friendly people

04:29.000 --> 04:32.200
think about components, but I mean, now it's in everything.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.080
It's actually baked into the web platform.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.880
We have web components, it's in the name.

04:37.880 --> 04:43.040
So I think the next evolution is, what do they call them?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
Design tokens.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.520
I think that's the next evolution of design systems.

04:47.520 --> 04:55.440
And there's this ability to cross-share design tokens between systems like Figma, Benpot,

04:55.440 --> 05:00.480
and then like your development environment where you literally export like a JSON definition

05:00.480 --> 05:04.500
and you have these tools that can take that and generate code.

05:04.500 --> 05:08.480
I used this one from Adobe where basically you have that and then you can tell it like

05:08.480 --> 05:13.520
generate me the style sheets for, I put it in quotes because it's more than just style

05:13.520 --> 05:20.240
sheets, for web, iOS, Android, blah, blah, and it's like just root all from the single

05:20.240 --> 05:21.240
JSON thing.

05:21.240 --> 05:25.560
And then once the designers make the changes in Figma, say for example, and they export

05:25.560 --> 05:33.080
the latest version, it like just does like a automatic re-roll and I'm looking forward

05:33.080 --> 05:34.560
to that being more of a thing.

05:34.560 --> 05:40.320
It's still early days there, but at this point you have to do quite a bit of hacking to get

05:40.320 --> 05:46.320
it to work really efficiently, but I'm looking forward to the future of what that can be.

05:46.320 --> 05:52.860
So I noticed a post that you wrote called, learning to code in a time of crisis.

05:52.860 --> 05:57.400
I love the title, it intrigues me, so I automatically want to know more.

05:57.400 --> 06:01.280
And I think that probably ties into one of the other questions I often ask, which is,

06:01.280 --> 06:06.280
what advice do you have for early stage web developers or developers in general on how

06:06.280 --> 06:08.080
to stay motivated?

06:08.080 --> 06:09.440
Right.

06:09.440 --> 06:15.800
So I'm going to start with like the post, the blog post, learning to code in time of

06:15.800 --> 06:19.920
crisis first, and then I'll sort of find advice from that.

06:19.920 --> 06:32.480
So my idea with this post, which was interesting because I started writing it in 2020, in March,

06:32.480 --> 06:39.040
when the whole world shut down, we know what happened, I had a couple of people ask me

06:39.040 --> 06:44.460
whether it was easy to find a job as a coder and if it was something they could break into,

06:44.460 --> 06:51.560
so I started writing it, started outlining it, and then I wasn't super happy with it

06:51.560 --> 06:58.200
and I sort of shelved it because as you know, in 2021, the economy kicked back again, then

06:58.200 --> 07:03.880
we had this boom in tech which seemed was going to last forever, but it didn't.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.800
In 2022, the economy is in a pickle again.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.600
And I had also another person ask me the same question and I was like, you know what, I'm

07:12.600 --> 07:17.200
going to finish it, find another angle to it, and that's what I did.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.680
So the blog post has a couple of things in it.

07:20.680 --> 07:27.600
The first main point is the job market sucks right now if you're trying to break into it

07:27.600 --> 07:32.800
as a beginner, but that doesn't mean it's impossible and you just want to be realistic

07:32.800 --> 07:33.800
with it.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.300
It's like even if you heard these stories maybe a year ago, two years ago, three years

07:37.300 --> 07:45.000
ago of people going from zero to great coding job in three, six months, it may happen to

07:45.000 --> 07:47.120
you again, but it's just less likely.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.440
So just got to be realistic with the state of the tech market right now.

07:51.440 --> 07:57.340
That doesn't mean, as I said, it's impossible, but just want to be realistic.

07:57.340 --> 07:58.720
So that's like with the negatives.

07:58.720 --> 08:04.780
With the positives though, the great thing is the tech industry is used to people coming

08:04.780 --> 08:12.440
from a variety of backgrounds and going from the most random jobs to coding.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.920
I think I have a bunch of examples there.

08:14.920 --> 08:21.320
But yeah, so it's not a foreign thing to do, it's not to say that there's zero elitism

08:21.320 --> 08:25.640
in the tech industry, it exists everywhere, but we're used to people jumping from different

08:25.640 --> 08:30.160
careers so we will not be looked at weirdly or if you think your case is really unusual

08:30.160 --> 08:34.320
like, oh, but I don't know, I'm coming from this very specific background, it's probably

08:34.320 --> 08:38.120
someone else who did something similar.

08:38.120 --> 08:47.780
That's one part and also with developers in particular and designers too, remote work

08:47.780 --> 08:49.960
is definitely a thing now.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.760
So if you think about it in a way that if you're looking for a job, you have access

08:54.760 --> 09:00.740
to companies, of course, you can go as far as you want on the entire planet, some people

09:00.740 --> 09:06.120
work across multiple time zones and everything, but even within your own country, even if

09:06.120 --> 09:11.240
you think, okay, just within my own country, I can apply to pretty much any company there,

09:11.240 --> 09:15.520
not any but like a ton of companies there who do remote work, that's a huge advantage

09:15.520 --> 09:20.720
compared to whatever job, if you're a nurse or something that needs you to move your life

09:20.720 --> 09:24.560
around, what about your partner, what about your children?

09:24.560 --> 09:25.560
And that's amazing.

09:25.560 --> 09:30.040
I mean, there's tons of companies that work across countries, across time zones, like

09:30.040 --> 09:33.920
you in South Africa, you're in the same time zone as Germany, for example, so you could

09:33.920 --> 09:37.400
work with a German company like me, right?

09:37.400 --> 09:40.880
But even if you think at the smaller scale of like, okay, just my own country, that's

09:40.880 --> 09:49.880
already a huge advantage and so they're good and there's bad and it's still a good thing

09:49.880 --> 09:55.720
to learn, but just be realistic that the market is weird at the moment.

09:55.720 --> 10:00.560
Yeah, what do you think is weird about it?

10:00.560 --> 10:11.400
Do you think it's that maybe the opportunities that exist require a certain amount of experience

10:11.400 --> 10:16.480
and that is the problem for early stage folks is they lack that experience and so while

10:16.480 --> 10:23.880
there might be a shortage of skills, it's more a shortage of skills of experienced developers,

10:23.880 --> 10:32.560
not so much new developers, or do you think companies are hesitant towards hiring juniors?

10:32.560 --> 10:37.680
The problem right now is that there were a ton of layoffs, so you have a huge pool of

10:37.680 --> 10:41.440
experienced coders that are on the market, so that's the problem.

10:41.440 --> 10:46.440
If you have one opening, you'll probably get the most experience because you can, right?

10:46.440 --> 10:52.680
Because there was all these layoffs happening, but again, it depends, it doesn't mean it's

10:52.680 --> 10:59.800
impossible, it's just harder than it used to be when you had more of an equal distribution

10:59.800 --> 11:03.200
of people of all levels entering the market.

11:03.200 --> 11:08.400
Now you have this ton of layoffs, you have a ton of people with experience that are being

11:08.400 --> 11:14.120
dumped into the markets looking for jobs at the same time, so it's harder.

11:14.120 --> 11:22.480
I just hope it will balance out in the near future, but at least in the summer, just for

11:22.480 --> 11:27.960
people listening to this in the future, since the spring of 2022, we had basically non-stop

11:27.960 --> 11:35.240
big layoffs happening all the time, and we're recording this in September, early October,

11:35.240 --> 11:42.160
so in the past four months, it's been non-stop, company X laid off 1,000 tech workers, company

11:42.160 --> 11:50.080
B laid off 500, so it's just really hitting it hard, but I hope it will balance out.

11:50.080 --> 11:54.440
But as you said, there's still a shortage of developers, people are still struggling

11:54.440 --> 12:00.000
to find them, so that's not going to disappear, and more, as we know, technology is eating

12:00.000 --> 12:06.200
our lives, so I don't see that stopping, but yeah, the market conditions are a bit weird

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
at the moment.

12:07.200 --> 12:11.760
Yeah, that's a good point, yeah, I don't think about that, that's a very good insight.

12:11.760 --> 12:19.160
So with that, with that challenge, I think already for early stage developers and people

12:19.160 --> 12:25.720
switching careers and stuff like that, it's already stressful, a little scary, and now

12:25.720 --> 12:30.760
you have this added thing that you just mentioned, where it's like, oh, now I'm competing against

12:30.760 --> 12:37.480
somebody with five years experience, I'm stuffed, how would you, any advice on how to stay motivated

12:37.480 --> 12:41.920
and just keep going, keep trying, don't give up?

12:41.920 --> 12:51.920
For sure, yeah, I think keep at it, as you said, and be consistent, even if you'll, so

12:51.920 --> 12:56.840
it's a bit of a weirdly worded way of saying it, but keep at it, be consistent, even if

12:56.840 --> 13:03.040
you'll see inconsistency like everything else, because learning everything, your progress

13:03.040 --> 13:09.960
will not be linear, so it's like learning a musical instrument or anything, sometimes

13:09.960 --> 13:14.000
you're going to make a ton of progress in a couple of weeks, and then you really struggle

13:14.000 --> 13:20.320
for like three or four, and then it's going to go up and down like this, and it's not

13:20.320 --> 13:24.960
easy, and my own personal failure to be any good at any musical instrument can attest

13:24.960 --> 13:28.960
to that, so yeah, somehow with coding it worked.

13:28.960 --> 13:34.120
I guess with coding maybe it's easier to see progress, because you can visually see your

13:34.120 --> 13:38.600
programs becoming more complicated, whereas maybe with a musical instrument you're just

13:38.600 --> 13:43.240
getting a little bit faster, maybe I'm just making excuses, doesn't matter, but yeah,

13:43.240 --> 13:49.440
so going back to the word of advice, yeah, keep at it, it will be inconsistent, and keep

13:49.440 --> 13:55.760
the end goal in mind, and have an achievable end goal, so if you think, okay, I want to

13:55.760 --> 14:02.400
build up a portfolio of work that includes Project X, make sure you have that in mind,

14:02.400 --> 14:07.520
and you keep thinking, okay, I'm moving towards that goal, rather than just like have this

14:07.520 --> 14:14.280
abstract thing like, I'm going to learn Python, you know, like, yes, you know, but it's very

14:14.280 --> 14:19.360
easy to fizzle out when you have a goal like this, just learn Python, what does that mean,

14:19.360 --> 14:20.360
you know?

14:20.360 --> 14:27.960
Yeah, I'm definitely a very goal-oriented person, I've mentioned it in previous episodes

14:27.960 --> 14:31.840
of the podcast, I find it very difficult to learn something for the sake of learning it,

14:31.840 --> 14:38.320
I always need an outlet for it, like I need, you know, either something I can contribute

14:38.320 --> 14:43.760
to that uses the technology I'm learning, so I can like apply what I learn, or just

14:43.760 --> 14:48.400
scratching on my own itch, or even make up my own little project, even if it's like just

14:48.400 --> 14:56.880
for me, just as a means of using the skills I'm learning, if I feel I'm just like making

14:56.880 --> 15:01.420
the little food app that you're doing as part of the course, it doesn't feel as fulfilling

15:01.420 --> 15:10.400
to me, and because a lot of the courses like feed off each other, which is good, it's like

15:10.400 --> 15:16.680
music where, you know, the music you make today is influenced by the music from the

15:16.680 --> 15:20.980
past, and so sometimes you'll hear a band and you'll say, I hear a little bit of Rolling

15:20.980 --> 15:26.320
Stones in there with weeks with a little bit of Beatles, and it's good, I mean, it's good,

15:26.320 --> 15:31.880
I heard, I don't know, the artist Grimes, I listened to an interview with her, I'm not

15:31.880 --> 15:36.160
a fan of her music or anything, but she's a very fascinating person, and she says, music

15:36.160 --> 15:40.080
is like having a conversation with those who came before you, and I think that was really

15:40.080 --> 15:48.120
just beautiful, and so yeah, I think the same thing here, I do think it's good that these

15:48.120 --> 15:55.640
course materials are feeding off each other and improving through that, but maybe they

15:55.640 --> 16:01.680
should look at expanding the portfolio of examples you build, so it's not like you're

16:01.680 --> 16:08.560
building just another food app, another to-do app, because that can get tedious.

16:08.560 --> 16:13.600
I wanted to jump into a different problem, now I'm thinking if I should first flip to

16:13.600 --> 16:19.160
a different topic or we should just keep going, I think let's just keep going on this road.

16:19.160 --> 16:24.140
So I think you've highlighted some of these things, but maybe we can dig into it more.

16:24.140 --> 16:27.960
From your perspective, what do you think are the biggest problems in the tech industry?

16:27.960 --> 16:36.560
Yeah, so I generally don't like thinking absolute statements like their biggest, but I think

16:36.560 --> 16:44.840
a big problem we have that is recognized still is diversity, even though we've improved a

16:44.840 --> 16:45.840
lot.

16:45.840 --> 16:53.080
Don't get me wrong, the tech workforce of today looks nothing like the tech workforce

16:53.080 --> 17:01.760
of five, six, seven years ago, really improved a lot in that regard, but it's still a problem.

17:01.760 --> 17:07.640
We still know we need to have more diverse voices and it kind of feeds off with what

17:07.640 --> 17:12.720
we were talking about with having people from different backgrounds, right?

17:12.720 --> 17:22.920
The more we have people that come in with a fresh eye from a random job before, the

17:22.920 --> 17:26.400
better our product is going to be, right?

17:26.400 --> 17:32.880
And so this is something that the tech industry knows there's a problem and we're trying to

17:32.880 --> 17:36.320
fix it, but it's more aware that there's still a problem.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.920
And then coming back, I guess, to what we were saying, this is also where it's interesting

17:39.920 --> 17:44.520
where people would hire you because you were talking as a beginner, because when you were

17:44.520 --> 17:49.400
talking about earlier about how the hell do I compete with someone who has five years,

17:49.400 --> 17:55.800
maybe even if you don't have as many actual years, maybe there's something about your

17:55.800 --> 18:01.120
background and about yourself and about the way you see design and accessibility that

18:01.120 --> 18:06.160
is unique to you and someone who's been working on a very specific thing for five years cannot

18:06.160 --> 18:08.800
contribute to the company and the product.

18:08.800 --> 18:16.520
So that also is, I guess, like a beacon of hope, I guess, for people breaking in, trying

18:16.520 --> 18:19.680
to break into the industry.

18:19.680 --> 18:24.560
Yeah, I think that leads me to a different topic also, which is interviews.

18:24.560 --> 18:35.080
And I think there is where we have another problem with tech, and I think this one might

18:35.080 --> 18:37.200
be very tech specific.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.800
I think generally the diversity problem is not just a tech problem, it's very visible

18:41.800 --> 18:45.240
in tech and it's been made very visible and that's good.

18:45.240 --> 18:49.640
I mean, it needs to be visible before anybody's going to do anything about it.

18:49.640 --> 18:55.080
It's like we saw with COVID, like it was very visible that we have a problem, like the world

18:55.080 --> 18:56.960
rallied around it.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.040
So that's important.

18:59.040 --> 19:07.680
But I think the other side with the interviews is if you take a junior through the same interview

19:07.680 --> 19:13.560
process as somebody with five years experience, generally the person with five years experience

19:13.560 --> 19:16.560
are going to win every time.

19:16.560 --> 19:20.080
Because if you don't ask those questions, like what you said, like, why do you bring

19:20.080 --> 19:24.080
to the project that's unique, if you don't dig into that side of it and you just focus

19:24.080 --> 19:30.520
on the wide-forged algorithm things, the junior is going to lose that interview every time.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.680
And I can see how that can be demotivational.

19:33.680 --> 19:38.680
So I think with tech interviews, the one thing that we need to, but I think this is also

19:38.680 --> 19:45.320
a little bit, I don't want to be the person who always puts the burden on the other person

19:45.320 --> 19:49.280
and like give the recruiters an out.

19:49.280 --> 19:57.340
But I do think as an applicant to a job, you need to speak to those things.

19:57.340 --> 20:02.640
You need to speak to what you can bring, not just from a technical perspective, but from

20:02.640 --> 20:05.320
how you think about stuff.

20:05.320 --> 20:13.720
And I think one of the previous folks I spoke to, Adelson Sandoval, he made a point of that,

20:13.720 --> 20:19.800
like how important it is to understand the company that you're applying to, understanding

20:19.800 --> 20:25.240
their technology and maybe even coming to the table with some ideas because you've taken

20:25.240 --> 20:28.400
the time to research what the company does, what their goals are.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.960
And it's easier, of course, if the company has an open source aspect to them, because

20:32.960 --> 20:35.800
you can literally see the code, you can literally see what they do.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.480
And through that, you might see some stuff.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.200
But I think also just in general, companies should be open to the idea that a junior can

20:42.200 --> 20:47.960
bring something to the table that a senior might not, even if it's just in the way that

20:47.960 --> 20:54.680
they're going to ask questions about stuff that other people have stopped thinking about,

20:54.680 --> 20:59.400
because it feels like it's just part of your DNA now.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.360
Yeah, absolutely.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.520
I'm a huge proponent of hiring juniors.

21:04.520 --> 21:08.160
I think there's lots of values.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.160
It's someone with fresh eyes.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.160
That's what it is, really.

21:10.160 --> 21:18.520
And that has a ton of value, especially if you're a company of the same kind of people

21:18.520 --> 21:21.920
who have been building the same product for a while.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.240
It's hard to see what's going on with fresh eyes.

21:25.240 --> 21:30.520
And coming back to what you said about maybe not liking to always throw the burden to someone

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
else.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.440
But the someone else is us, though.

21:33.440 --> 21:36.000
It's developers when we're hiring others.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.280
It's like when you have an opening in your team.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.900
It's us knowing, do we really want to give them a four-hour take-home test?

21:42.900 --> 21:44.720
Do we really need that?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.560
It's us pushing back.

21:46.560 --> 21:52.220
Or something I'm also a big advocate of is if we do think, because it's a more senior

21:52.220 --> 22:00.400
position or whatever, that a three-hour take-home test is the way to go, then pay the person.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.080
So yeah, I feel like it's on us.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.720
It's on us developers thinking in terms of recruiting.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.960
It's not just the recruiters.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.760
It's how we word our job description as well.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.880
Do we need to have so much like...

22:13.880 --> 22:16.840
There's even internal jargon sometimes.

22:16.840 --> 22:17.840
Sometimes I see this.

22:17.840 --> 22:23.440
And it's like we're part of the Prometheus group within Facebook or whatever.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.320
And I'm like, what the hell is a Prometheus group?

22:25.320 --> 22:26.320
Why do I care?

22:26.320 --> 22:27.600
It's an applicant.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.840
And it's like sometimes you see things like this.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.420
And yeah, it's on us to make sure that we're...

22:32.420 --> 22:37.780
We're always super keen to share our job posting on LinkedIn and whatever and be like, come

22:37.780 --> 22:38.780
work with me.

22:38.780 --> 22:39.780
And I do that too.

22:39.780 --> 22:40.780
Don't get me wrong.

22:40.780 --> 22:44.760
But it's also on us to make sure that the job description we share makes sense.

22:44.760 --> 22:49.320
And that we have our hiring process nailed and we're not like, oh, what are we doing?

22:49.320 --> 22:50.320
I don't know.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.880
Let's give them a three-hour home test.

22:51.880 --> 22:52.880
What?

22:52.880 --> 22:53.880
I don't know.

22:53.880 --> 22:54.880
Let's do a to-do list as well.

22:54.880 --> 22:55.880
Yay.

22:55.880 --> 22:59.240
But then when you're an applicant, if you have three companies giving you that, it starts

22:59.240 --> 23:01.000
to add up and it's...

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
That's it.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.800
It starts to add up and it starts to be annoying.

23:03.800 --> 23:11.080
Whereas if it's more like, okay, we're just going to come on Zoom for an hour, have them

23:11.080 --> 23:15.460
walk through code or just do a simple code example of like, hey, can you fetch something

23:15.460 --> 23:18.080
from the GitHub API, walk us through it?

23:18.080 --> 23:19.080
Something like that.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.080
That's a way...

23:20.080 --> 23:24.440
In my opinion, that's a way better interview process because you're not requiring a ton

23:24.440 --> 23:25.760
of commitment.

23:25.760 --> 23:31.820
You're still looking at how the person is coding, but you're not placing this huge burden

23:31.820 --> 23:37.520
on them to find three hours spare time and polish an app and do whatever.

23:37.520 --> 23:43.040
And again, that multiplied by every company you're applying to, right?

23:43.040 --> 23:50.600
So yeah, I feel like it's on us as developers with a bit of experience who are going to

23:50.600 --> 23:56.920
be in the position to hire someone else to make sure that our process is as accessible

23:56.920 --> 23:57.920
as it can be.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.920
Yeah.

23:58.920 --> 23:59.920
Yeah.

23:59.920 --> 24:02.240
That's very good.

24:02.240 --> 24:07.400
I wonder with that hour long interview where you do something, would you give somebody

24:07.400 --> 24:13.160
like a hint as to what the question might be?

24:13.160 --> 24:17.800
You don't necessarily will tell them you're going to be using the GitHub API, but maybe

24:17.800 --> 24:21.760
you'll tell them we're going to have this hour long conversation and basically as part

24:21.760 --> 24:28.120
of that, we will have you do a request to an API to get some data and display it on

24:28.120 --> 24:29.120
a webpage.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.160
Would you put that in?

24:31.160 --> 24:36.520
I think it depends on, again, the seniority level, what kind of things you're solving

24:36.520 --> 24:42.520
because for example, sometimes you're more interested in the presentation, right?

24:42.520 --> 24:48.320
So you're like, okay, we'll give you like with that same example, right?

24:48.320 --> 24:54.280
So you can be really interested in how someone writes the tests for this request to the API.

24:54.280 --> 24:59.700
That could be like a primary focus or it could be, yeah, just get something from this API,

24:59.700 --> 25:03.760
but what we really want you to focus on is make sure the, I don't know if you have a

25:03.760 --> 25:09.700
search or something or whatever you're displaying from the API, make sure that it's accessible.

25:09.700 --> 25:15.160
So it really depends what you're looking for in the role, but yeah, I think you drop hints

25:15.160 --> 25:22.960
based on what you're trying to have them focus on versus if it's a pure front end and you

25:22.960 --> 25:26.480
want someone who really knows about accessibility and it's something that they've said in their

25:26.480 --> 25:31.080
CV as well, you don't want them to spend 20 minutes figuring out there's a missing header

25:31.080 --> 25:32.320
to that API or whatever.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.720
You could just help them with that because that's not the primary thing.

25:35.720 --> 25:36.720
Gotcha.

25:36.720 --> 25:37.720
Gotcha.

25:37.720 --> 25:38.720
Yeah, that sounds like a very healthy approach.

25:38.720 --> 25:39.720
I really like that.

25:39.720 --> 25:43.440
I'm glad more people did that, more companies.

25:43.440 --> 25:44.440
That's good.

25:44.440 --> 25:52.040
I'm glad you've said that and now it's out there for people to listen to and take note.

25:52.040 --> 25:57.800
This leads us into this next question, which is I noticed a tweet from you about CascadiaJS

25:57.800 --> 26:03.320
and they mentioned that they post all the recordings of their events because they believe

26:03.320 --> 26:05.240
in open sourcing knowledge.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.340
Love that, by the way.

26:07.340 --> 26:13.320
And so I wonder, what are your thoughts with regards to open source, the open source ecosystem

26:13.320 --> 26:15.880
and its role in developer education?

26:15.880 --> 26:19.920
Because especially I think it touches on that topic previously, which we talked about, about

26:19.920 --> 26:23.800
Junior's lack of experience, lack of working experience.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.840
Can open source play a role here?

26:25.840 --> 26:29.160
For sure.

26:29.160 --> 26:34.280
As you mentioned before, with open source, what's great, you can see real code.

26:34.280 --> 26:37.800
You can see if someone has a small project, they open source it.

26:37.800 --> 26:41.920
You can see, okay, this is how this specific app works.

26:41.920 --> 26:47.580
It allows you to explore and to see a real code in action, which is great.

26:47.580 --> 26:53.140
Especially now with things like Netlify and Versailles, it's a lot easier to host things

26:53.140 --> 26:58.820
than it was before because before it was like, oh, I have to do whatever.

26:58.820 --> 27:03.440
People tend to just have a GitHub and that just automatically publishes to Netlify or

27:03.440 --> 27:07.720
something and it makes it easier to say, oh, okay, I got this code and it's powering this

27:07.720 --> 27:08.720
page.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.220
And you know, there's no in between.

27:10.220 --> 27:12.060
This is the build step.

27:12.060 --> 27:14.320
It's all in there and it's all visible.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.320
So that's great.

27:15.320 --> 27:21.480
I feel like in terms of developer education, though, we now have more of a curation problem

27:21.480 --> 27:27.440
than a number of resources problem.

27:27.440 --> 27:30.600
I feel like there's a ton of knowledge and it's fantastic.

27:30.600 --> 27:35.740
We're extremely lucky that we have tons of people writing tutorials in their spare time

27:35.740 --> 27:37.000
on their blogs and stuff.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.160
So there's a lot of knowledge going around.

27:40.160 --> 27:45.720
But we might have more of a, as I said, curation problem in that we need to figure out how

27:45.720 --> 27:51.500
to triage all the tutorials and everything to make sure, okay, this is what I need to

27:51.500 --> 27:54.240
build a specific thing.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.720
But yeah, otherwise, I think it's fantastic.

27:56.720 --> 28:00.600
Yeah, I agree 100% of that.

28:00.600 --> 28:05.000
I think Riku from the very first podcast said, you feel like you're this little drop that

28:05.000 --> 28:09.320
fell into this ocean and you don't know if it's some up or down or left or right.

28:09.320 --> 28:12.360
Because you're like drowning, drowning in information.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.920
I think we are there.

28:13.920 --> 28:17.800
And I think one of the projects that we are undertaking as part of the Mycelium Network

28:17.800 --> 28:24.680
is the web workbook, which is not meant to be, let's try and do a better MDN.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.400
No, it's the opposite.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.680
Let's, let's, let's curate content.

28:29.680 --> 28:34.840
And let's, let's define pathways, topics, technology paths.

28:34.840 --> 28:40.800
And let's as a, as a community, share things that have helped us and let's try and make

28:40.800 --> 28:46.120
it easier for people to know, okay, I've finished this part, where do I go from here?

28:46.120 --> 28:48.800
What are the content that I can trust?

28:48.800 --> 28:55.920
Who are the people I should be following that shares really good, that has a teaching style

28:55.920 --> 29:01.960
that works really well, and also finding different ways of learning because not everybody likes

29:01.960 --> 29:06.380
to read, not everybody likes to watch a video.

29:06.380 --> 29:08.720
Some people like me are very, very practical.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.520
So you want something that has a practical aspect to it.

29:11.520 --> 29:18.680
So kind of trying to curate stuff around topics, technologies and pathways.

29:18.680 --> 29:23.040
It's a big, it's a big undertaking, but I think I'm hearing it more and more and more

29:23.040 --> 29:25.200
that this is what is needed.

29:25.200 --> 29:29.560
Like speaking to, to early stage developers, it's, it's almost, I don't think I've spoken

29:29.560 --> 29:32.320
to one that has not said this.

29:32.320 --> 29:36.680
So the fact that you also brought it up is just like, it's clear that that is something

29:36.680 --> 29:37.680
that's needed.

29:37.680 --> 29:41.240
And I'm really excited about that project, but you know, it's still early days and there's

29:41.240 --> 29:45.040
a lot, there's a lot to do, a lot of planning, there's a lot of planning.

29:45.040 --> 29:49.500
And I think that's one of the things that is interesting about people who are getting

29:49.500 --> 29:55.440
into code is they don't realize how big a part of the job that is, is planning.

29:55.440 --> 30:00.280
Sure, you're going to write a lot of code probably, but you're also going to spend a

30:00.280 --> 30:05.320
lot of time planning before you write all the code.

30:05.320 --> 30:08.600
Friend of mine, Peter has the famous thing where he says, writing the code is the easy

30:08.600 --> 30:10.280
part.

30:10.280 --> 30:16.480
Understanding the problem and finding a solution, that is, that is the hard part.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.680
And then it's almost like you take your crypt notes and you just turn it into code.

30:20.680 --> 30:25.200
It's, it's oversimplified, of course, but I like the statement, I like the way he phrases

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
it.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.760
Yeah, that's really cool.

30:27.760 --> 30:33.760
So I, another thing that I saw about you, and it makes me think that you are somebody

30:33.760 --> 30:40.560
and I in that same camp that like ethical tech or like are passionate about ethical

30:40.560 --> 30:42.240
tech.

30:42.240 --> 30:47.920
You mentioned on the rise of Signal, I use Signal myself.

30:47.920 --> 30:56.720
I've used it before the web app, the WhatsApp debacle, but I kind of still used WhatsApp

30:56.720 --> 30:59.960
at that point because some of the family and things were on there, you know, that's the

30:59.960 --> 31:07.120
common problem, but like I've gotten off all of that stuff.

31:07.120 --> 31:15.080
I just decided that for me personally, I need to, I need to put my money where my mouth is.

31:15.080 --> 31:19.440
That's not entirely correct, but you know what I'm trying to say?

31:19.440 --> 31:26.840
So I like to hear your views on what you think about ethical tech and its role in improving

31:26.840 --> 31:30.320
the tech world and the world maybe even in general.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.320
Yeah.

31:31.320 --> 31:36.560
So this, so you're talking about the blog post that I wrote as well about like, again,

31:36.560 --> 31:44.880
the rise of Signal and the, again, my thesis there was that when Signal got the spotlight,

31:44.880 --> 31:48.680
it already had all the ingredients to succeed.

31:48.680 --> 31:52.160
Basically it had roughly the same features of WhatsApp.

31:52.160 --> 31:58.200
It was already a polished product because the problem you have with more ethical tech

31:58.200 --> 32:02.600
in general, and you could think of this as in the broadest sense possible of like it's

32:02.600 --> 32:08.800
more ethical because it's open source, because it doesn't have like a giant weird company

32:08.800 --> 32:09.800
behind it or whatever.

32:09.800 --> 32:15.860
So the problem we have with usually with this type of tech is that it's just not as good.

32:15.860 --> 32:21.160
Like it doesn't have like the same level of visual flair or whatever than the mainstream

32:21.160 --> 32:22.160
thing.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.680
So people are kind of stuck with like the old thing because the usability is not right.

32:26.680 --> 32:31.580
And when Signal had its moment, it's what I put in the article as well, it had a big

32:31.580 --> 32:37.960
boost because Elon Musk tweeted just two words, use Signal, right?

32:37.960 --> 32:42.880
And it's credited with like, suddenly all the newspapers were talking about it and like

32:42.880 --> 32:48.280
he already has a huge account, but people also like retweeted it to hell.

32:48.280 --> 32:53.280
But my thesis is that if he had tweeted, use Linux, no one would care.

32:53.280 --> 32:57.160
Because Linux is not there yet in terms of like, oh, I can just, it's just like, I can

32:57.160 --> 33:03.000
just flip a button and suddenly my, I have a perfect, you know, I have the same thing,

33:03.000 --> 33:05.360
I have the same apps, everything looks great.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.760
And it's very easy to install.

33:06.760 --> 33:10.720
Like I know I might get some heat from like Linux users from this, but like, it's not

33:10.720 --> 33:15.560
as easy as, you know, just like a Mac, things are not as intuitive.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.800
Again, there's lots of progress being made there.

33:17.800 --> 33:21.200
I don't want to like, you know, undermine that.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.600
Like this also got a lot more accessible than it was.

33:24.600 --> 33:29.360
Like, you know, in the, if you're talking about like Linux, even 10 years ago or even

33:29.360 --> 33:33.040
the worst in the like 2005 ish, it was impossible.

33:33.040 --> 33:38.880
You had to like go into the command line thing to install whatever, but like, yeah.

33:38.880 --> 33:44.600
So it's getting better, but we're still, we're still have ways to go.

33:44.600 --> 33:49.640
And that was the idea of the blog post about ethical tech in general.

33:49.640 --> 33:55.640
To me, it's usually when like what you want in tech is to as much as possible is for incentives

33:55.640 --> 33:58.000
to be aligned, right?

33:58.000 --> 34:02.520
So to give you a counterexample, that's not the case with social media, right?

34:02.520 --> 34:06.240
They have no incentive to, I don't want not to like, I'm not going to name a specific

34:06.240 --> 34:11.280
company, but they have no incentive to make media that's actually increase, you know,

34:11.280 --> 34:12.800
that is social.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.860
What they want to do is put you on, is for you to stay on the platform for as long as

34:16.860 --> 34:19.800
possible because you can see more ads, right?

34:19.800 --> 34:28.020
And they do this with, you know, by creating outrage, fear, whatever, you know, controversy.

34:28.020 --> 34:31.880
And that's not by making a media that makes people sociable and, you know, people want

34:31.880 --> 34:32.880
to interact.

34:32.880 --> 34:37.280
Because if you just see some funny, you know, good vibe things for 10 minutes and you leave,

34:37.280 --> 34:38.280
that's not what they want.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.080
You know, it's not in their interest, right?

34:40.080 --> 34:47.960
So as a result, the incentives are completely misaligned, whereas I'm going to like use

34:47.960 --> 34:50.680
the example of another company that I like.

34:50.680 --> 34:54.960
And I think I can start to recommend because they're starting to be as good as the alternative,

34:54.960 --> 35:01.280
like with ProtonMail, for example, like they're all about like building an email that's private.

35:01.280 --> 35:06.240
The day they are caught selling ads, everyone of their customer will leave.

35:06.240 --> 35:10.400
So they have, you know, their interests are aligned with what they're preaching to be,

35:10.400 --> 35:11.400
right?

35:11.400 --> 35:13.060
It's like we want to make a private email.

35:13.060 --> 35:17.720
So as a result, we know they can sell data or they can be hacked because the day that

35:17.720 --> 35:24.120
happens, they know they're going to lose like 50% of their customers at least.

35:24.120 --> 35:30.020
And again, like talking, using the example of ProtonMail, like if we had this conversation

35:30.020 --> 35:34.080
two years ago, I would not be able to recommend ProtonMail to you because they didn't have

35:34.080 --> 35:39.080
a calendar, like, you know, it didn't have like things like dark mode.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.960
It still looked a little bit clunky.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.480
Like if you received, again, a Google Calendar invite, you couldn't do anything with it.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.440
Now you could just press the same button that you have in Gmail that says, yes, I would

35:47.440 --> 35:48.440
like to attend.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.920
Boom, you press that and that's it.

35:49.920 --> 35:56.640
So it's a similar enough experience that it's an alternative that's ethical and good, right?

35:56.640 --> 36:00.960
It's like you're not losing too much by like switching to the ethical product.

36:00.960 --> 36:07.440
Yeah, and I think there's another case happening right now with Penpot and Figma.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.160
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.760
Yeah, Figma was bought by Adobe.

36:12.760 --> 36:26.400
A lot of people are not happy about that, to say the least, and I mean, I think it's

36:26.400 --> 36:32.500
a complicated one because it's not like Figma is not a good fit for Adobe as a company.

36:32.500 --> 36:37.520
It is the history of Adobe and what they've done to products that they've purchased.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.760
That's the scary part here.

36:39.760 --> 36:44.280
And even though the CEO, Figma, said that, no, no, no, we're going to operate as an independent

36:44.280 --> 36:50.400
company and make our own decisions, but we do get access to all of this power of Adobe

36:50.400 --> 36:54.240
that they've developed over the years.

36:54.240 --> 36:59.440
It sounds good, but I don't know how true that really is.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.440
That's what everyone thinks.

37:00.440 --> 37:01.440
It's like, yeah, sure.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.440
Yeah, you got 20 billion for sure.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.440
Sure.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.440
Yeah.

37:05.440 --> 37:13.840
And then yesterday I saw Penpot announced they have an $8 million investment seed round,

37:13.840 --> 37:18.320
which means their blog post literally said, our time has come.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.280
And I'm really excited about that.

37:20.280 --> 37:27.600
And I have personally started using the two tools in tandem because like you said, when

37:27.600 --> 37:32.920
the WhatsApp thing happened, Signal had all the ingredients to just take its place.

37:32.920 --> 37:37.240
Penpot is close, but not quite there.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.040
Like I found some bugs which I'm raising.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.040
Like this is open source.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.040
It's awesome.

37:42.040 --> 37:46.440
I can just go and tell them, this is the thing I'm seeing and maybe I can maybe even help

37:46.440 --> 37:47.440
fix the problem.

37:47.440 --> 37:54.280
Because currently if I drag an SVG into it and some of the elements has color, all the

37:54.280 --> 38:00.640
color disappears and they either render them invisible or white or it renders that it's

38:00.640 --> 38:02.160
all black.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.640
And then you have to go in and edit it in Penpot.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.040
So there's a bug there.

38:06.040 --> 38:13.840
But then the other thing that I miss badly is auto layout.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.840
That is not in Penpot yet and that is a big feature.

38:16.840 --> 38:21.920
And then I think the community plug-in stuff that the ecosystem that Figma has built, that's

38:21.920 --> 38:23.720
something that's missing as well.

38:23.720 --> 38:31.500
But with them having this $8 million investment and being open source and having a community

38:31.500 --> 38:34.240
that's now like, yeah, we need to support this project.

38:34.240 --> 38:38.520
I think all these gaps can be filled very, very quickly.

38:38.520 --> 38:41.080
And they are going to be filled very, very quickly.

38:41.080 --> 38:45.680
So I'm really excited about that and I'm definitely following that and seeing how I can help make

38:45.680 --> 38:50.760
Penpot be the successor of Figma.

38:50.760 --> 38:54.680
But with ProtonMail, I've been actually toying with that idea because I did see their announcement

38:54.680 --> 38:58.800
when they're like, now we have a VPN, we have a drive kind of thing, like Google Drive,

38:58.800 --> 39:02.440
we have calendaring, we have better, our email is better.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.880
And I tried it for a bit and it looks beautiful.

39:05.880 --> 39:10.600
And it has some functionality actually that Gmail doesn't.

39:10.600 --> 39:20.280
And the company I run called Mechanical Ink, I'm in the stage where I'm trying to define

39:20.280 --> 39:24.320
what the company, what I want the company to be because I don't want it to be another

39:24.320 --> 39:25.320
agency.

39:25.320 --> 39:26.320
I don't want that.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.440
At the moment, it kind of is because it pays the bills, right?

39:29.440 --> 39:32.800
But that is not the long-term thing.

39:32.800 --> 39:39.160
What I want it to be is a company that is heavily involved in open source and in ethical

39:39.160 --> 39:40.760
civic tech.

39:40.760 --> 39:46.240
And I need to find a way to be able to do that while creating job opportunities and

39:46.240 --> 39:53.520
being able to sustain my own, me and my family and my children.

39:53.520 --> 39:58.000
But as part of that, I mean, cause on the table, I use Google Workspace, right?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.320
For my company stuff.

40:00.320 --> 40:06.440
And I am considering switching to Proton because with what my future vision for the company

40:06.440 --> 40:15.040
is, I need to, again, put my money where my words are and say, I'm not going to use Google's

40:15.040 --> 40:16.040
product for this.

40:16.040 --> 40:21.320
I'm going to use an alternative, an ethical alternative because one does exist and only

40:21.320 --> 40:27.160
use tools that don't fit that bill when there really isn't an alternative.

40:27.160 --> 40:32.120
And then asking the question, is there a way that Mechanical Ink and the communities I

40:32.120 --> 40:39.600
build can help create this ethical alternative or plant the seeds so that people can come

40:39.600 --> 40:43.120
together and create these ethical alternatives?

40:43.120 --> 40:49.160
Wow, that was fun to talk about.

40:49.160 --> 40:55.520
So in the same kind of vein, has there been any person, book, event, anything like this

40:55.520 --> 41:00.960
that was impactful in your life just in general or maybe tech specific?

41:00.960 --> 41:07.360
Yeah, so just to wrap up what we said about like ethical tech, I think an important point

41:07.360 --> 41:12.720
too is that it doesn't have to be a full culture key switch right now.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.680
Like what you're talking about, like with Penpot, for example, like right now, Figma

41:17.680 --> 41:23.240
hasn't changed, but we know that if one year something really bad happens, like what everybody

41:23.240 --> 41:27.800
is fearing, which is it's being integrated with the Creative Suite, which is what everyone

41:27.800 --> 41:31.120
is like, please don't make me install Creative Suite, right?

41:31.120 --> 41:37.960
But if that happens in a year, Penpot had a year from now to get it stuck together.

41:37.960 --> 41:38.960
And it's kind of the same thing.

41:38.960 --> 41:44.920
You could say, okay, I'm looking at Proton right now, and maybe in a year I'll switch.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.880
And it's kind of the same thing for Penpot for all these things.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.760
So it's important to know that to have them in your radar, to keep checking as opposed

41:51.760 --> 41:55.220
to go, oh, let me see, can I do a culture key switch today?

41:55.220 --> 41:57.880
And you download it, and it doesn't work, and you forget about it forever.

41:57.880 --> 41:58.880
I've done that too.

41:58.880 --> 41:59.880
Don't get me wrong.

41:59.880 --> 42:02.840
But sometimes it's a bit of an easy thing to go...

42:02.840 --> 42:03.840
Because it's easier for your mind.

42:03.840 --> 42:07.000
You don't want to have this thing lingering of like, maybe I should switch to something

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
one day.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.840
So it's easier to go one day, look at it, and go, okay, right, is this the most optimal

42:12.840 --> 42:13.840
thing today?

42:13.840 --> 42:16.120
You look into it, it's like, nope, moving on.

42:16.120 --> 42:23.080
But you can say, okay, maybe let's check it in six months or a year.

42:23.080 --> 42:27.840
And also, as you're doing, just sharing something, they shipped something, you were talking about

42:27.840 --> 42:32.960
your SVG bug, when they fix it, if you share it, that's it, it's a little boost, even if

42:32.960 --> 42:39.360
you may not be using them already because of what you said, auto layout.

42:39.360 --> 42:43.720
To go back to your question about was there a person or an event or something that really

42:43.720 --> 42:50.280
impacted my career, I think I will say all the managers that gave me a chance, even if

42:50.280 --> 42:56.880
I didn't specifically fit the profile, I did lots of various things.

42:56.880 --> 43:02.320
And I feel like it also comes back to what we were saying about hiring people with diverse

43:02.320 --> 43:05.900
skill sets and not necessarily the perfect background.

43:05.900 --> 43:10.120
It happened to me a few times, I was lucky that someone was like, even if you don't have

43:10.120 --> 43:17.280
the perfect previous experience, I feel like you'll be a good fit here in the team.

43:17.280 --> 43:22.400
And that happened more than once, and every time that really just helped me a lot.

43:22.400 --> 43:30.720
I love that, I love that when people are open to giving you a chance and saying, let's see

43:30.720 --> 43:35.560
what you do, and then let's check back in a month.

43:35.560 --> 43:41.440
And if you show that you are a curious person who's willing to learn, let's keep going.

43:41.440 --> 43:45.120
I think companies need to be more open to that.

43:45.120 --> 43:52.400
So for, like I mentioned, this web workbook project, it's going to be very content heavy.

43:52.400 --> 44:00.440
And so we're going to be building it using Hugo as the static site generators aspect

44:00.440 --> 44:01.440
of it.

44:01.440 --> 44:05.400
But then we've got a community license from Contentful.

44:05.400 --> 44:11.680
And so we intend to use Contentful for our CMS.

44:11.680 --> 44:16.440
So I've read quite a bit about Contentful, and I've used a bunch of other ones like Netlify

44:16.440 --> 44:20.400
CMS, Forestry, and stuff like that.

44:20.400 --> 44:26.840
Can you talk to how Contentful is different, like what sets Contentful apart from all these

44:26.840 --> 44:27.840
other things?

44:27.840 --> 44:31.320
Because I know there's a lot of these things that's jumped up.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.320
Yeah.

44:32.320 --> 44:36.560
So that's the great thing about being a developer advocate and not a salesman, is that I don't

44:36.560 --> 44:38.720
have to give you a big sales pitch.

44:38.720 --> 44:47.440
What I'll say is Contentful, as you said, I'm glad you're going to be using us, but

44:47.440 --> 44:49.880
even if not, that's fine.

44:49.880 --> 44:57.120
So we're a headless content platform that helps all kinds of clients.

44:57.120 --> 45:04.120
So I think what I'll say is the great thing about Contentful is we've been at this for

45:04.120 --> 45:05.120
a while.

45:05.120 --> 45:12.960
It's one of the first companies in that space in having this idea of having something headless,

45:12.960 --> 45:20.360
having blocks of content, rather than moving from the old paradigm of this is a page.

45:20.360 --> 45:24.520
Everything in WordPress, for example, is a page, so you're with that structure, and you're

45:24.520 --> 45:28.560
hacking around with short codes or whatever.

45:28.560 --> 45:34.200
With Contentful, we have these entries and content types, which can be anything you want,

45:34.200 --> 45:37.560
and that gives you the great flexibility.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.600
So yeah, I'm glad you're using us.

45:40.600 --> 45:43.480
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

45:43.480 --> 45:47.160
So I'm thinking about which way to go next.

45:47.160 --> 45:54.360
I think I want to switch on, I noticed that you mentioned your coach also at Codebar.

45:54.360 --> 45:58.280
I have not heard about Codebar before, strangely enough, and I had a quick look at it and it

45:58.280 --> 46:02.200
looks interesting, but you know more about it than me, so I'm going to ask you to inform

46:02.200 --> 46:08.840
me about Codebar, what you do there, and what their mission is, and stuff like that.

46:08.840 --> 46:09.840
For sure.

46:09.840 --> 46:12.400
So I'm still a new coach too.

46:12.400 --> 46:18.960
So I started in about November, December of 2021 as a coach.

46:18.960 --> 46:25.240
So Codebar is basically a series of meetups that, historically, before COVID, happened

46:25.240 --> 46:27.200
in specific cities.

46:27.200 --> 46:32.040
So you have one in London, in Berlin, in New York, in Edinburgh, I think there's one in

46:32.040 --> 46:33.520
Paris too, anyway.

46:33.520 --> 46:40.240
So in each of these cities, it's a meetup to help people learn to code.

46:40.240 --> 46:44.920
So people who are learning to code come in with their problem, which could be anything,

46:44.920 --> 46:46.520
and they're like, hey, can I get help?

46:46.520 --> 46:51.760
And someone, a coach, will help them with that problem for two hours.

46:51.760 --> 46:52.760
And that could be anything.

46:52.760 --> 46:57.080
It could be, hey, I'm doing the free code camp, I'm stuck on chapter three, I'm trying

46:57.080 --> 47:00.760
to load an image and it doesn't work, and you're like, okay, sure, we'll fix that.

47:00.760 --> 47:04.600
Or it could be something, sometimes it's way more involved and like, hey, I already have

47:04.600 --> 47:08.920
this React app, but when I do this thing, I'm trying to query this thing and everything

47:08.920 --> 47:09.920
breaks.

47:09.920 --> 47:12.640
And it's like, okay, cool, let's have a look at this.

47:12.640 --> 47:15.940
And they try to pair coaches with skills.

47:15.940 --> 47:18.880
So when people register in advance, they're like, hey, I need help with Python.

47:18.880 --> 47:22.960
And we're like, well, and Codebar tries to make sure that there's someone who knows Python

47:22.960 --> 47:24.880
in the room, which is easier.

47:24.880 --> 47:31.480
Even though you can usually figure it out, because as an experienced coder, especially

47:31.480 --> 47:39.120
if it's an easier problem, sometimes it works across languages, but they try, Codebar tries

47:39.120 --> 47:45.400
to optimize the coach's skills with what the student needs.

47:45.400 --> 47:54.560
And historically, it was very much oriented towards underrepresented people in the industry.

47:54.560 --> 48:03.160
So yeah, the way I coach is on Discord and on Zoom, so you could just rock on to, I think

48:03.160 --> 48:04.880
it's pretty much open to any cities now.

48:04.880 --> 48:11.400
Like I've coached in Berlin, I've coached in London, even though I'm in neither city.

48:11.400 --> 48:17.400
A bunch more meetups are happening in person now.

48:17.400 --> 48:22.680
So I've been coaching less, plus also other engagements made it difficult.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.800
But yes, so that's the idea.

48:24.800 --> 48:25.800
That's interesting.

48:25.800 --> 48:34.400
So it's almost like this group of mentors that is just available to you when you get

48:34.400 --> 48:35.400
stuck.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.400
Yeah.

48:36.400 --> 48:37.400
That's really, really cool.

48:37.400 --> 48:41.680
And sorry, and they try to pair one to one all the time, at least.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.480
So sometimes you might get two students.

48:44.480 --> 48:48.740
It happens when there aren't enough coaches, but usually they're really good at making

48:48.740 --> 48:52.240
sure that if they got 10 students, they'd make sure we have 10 coaches.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.240
That's really interesting.

48:53.240 --> 48:55.920
I'm definitely going to have a look at that a bit more.

48:55.920 --> 48:59.720
That sounds like a good fit for our community, for sure.

48:59.720 --> 49:00.720
Yeah.

49:00.720 --> 49:01.720
Okay.

49:01.720 --> 49:06.880
I want to dig into something different, maybe similar, maybe different.

49:06.880 --> 49:11.880
So when you announced that you were joining Contentful, you pinned a tweet.

49:11.880 --> 49:17.320
And part of that tweet is that you mentioned that this was after the long break.

49:17.320 --> 49:24.320
So it made me curious about what was the reason behind that long break?

49:24.320 --> 49:28.280
Because let me preface this by why I find that interesting.

49:28.280 --> 49:36.720
I personally have had many, many struggles and continue to do with mental health in general,

49:36.720 --> 49:39.220
anxiety, things like this.

49:39.220 --> 49:41.920
And sometimes it gets to you.

49:41.920 --> 49:42.920
It drains you.

49:42.920 --> 49:47.920
It makes you tired and you do feel like you need a break.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.240
Not always possible.

49:49.240 --> 49:55.040
Sometimes you have to grin and bear through it, but sometimes you're either going to take

49:55.040 --> 50:00.080
that break or your body's going to force you to take that break in unpleasant ways.

50:00.080 --> 50:03.720
So I was curious, and I've spoken to other people also where burnout's been real.

50:03.720 --> 50:07.360
Like Ian Douglas is somebody I spoke to that almost quit tech because he was so burned

50:07.360 --> 50:08.360
out.

50:08.360 --> 50:14.880
So I was curious if maybe there are echoes of that in the story.

50:14.880 --> 50:17.000
So if you want to dig into that.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Yeah.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Yeah.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
I'm lucky.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.320
It's never been like a forced thing.

50:23.320 --> 50:24.320
I was getting tired.

50:24.320 --> 50:25.920
Like, I mean, let's be real.

50:25.920 --> 50:30.040
Like the world is upside down and has been for two years.

50:30.040 --> 50:33.040
So that doesn't help.

50:33.040 --> 50:36.080
But yeah, I was, yeah, I feel like I just wanted to change.

50:36.080 --> 50:44.320
So before, as I said in the intro, I was like a regular front end developer and I wanted

50:44.320 --> 50:45.980
to become a developer advocate.

50:45.980 --> 50:53.120
So I applied to a bunch of places and then luckily Contentful said yes, which was fantastic.

50:53.120 --> 50:59.560
And yeah, so in between leaving my old job, which was very hard, like I really liked my

50:59.560 --> 51:01.880
team and everything, but I felt like I needed to change.

51:01.880 --> 51:06.320
I was getting a little, yeah, a little tired of the whole thing.

51:06.320 --> 51:10.520
Like, yeah, just like, yeah, like mental health wise, it became harder.

51:10.520 --> 51:16.560
I feel like they're probably, as you said, just like accumulation of the, you know, the

51:16.560 --> 51:20.080
last two or three, the last two odd years.

51:20.080 --> 51:21.520
Yeah.

51:21.520 --> 51:26.680
So in between, I made sure to have some time off in between my last job at the Wall Street

51:26.680 --> 51:28.940
Journal and Contentful.

51:28.940 --> 51:38.040
So yeah, so I had about five weeks ish between, I don't have the dates right, but like about

51:38.040 --> 51:40.040
five weeks between.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.040
So it's not that long.

51:41.040 --> 51:45.480
It's long, especially if you compare it to like in America where they have like two weeks

51:45.480 --> 51:46.480
and that's it.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.480
That's it for the year.

51:47.480 --> 51:48.480
That's all you take off.

51:48.480 --> 51:53.080
But yeah, so it's long, but it's not extremely long.

51:53.080 --> 52:00.320
And during those five weeks, four or five weeks again, I went on the big road trip around

52:00.320 --> 52:02.120
the UK and it was fantastic.

52:02.120 --> 52:07.720
So yeah, that's how it, there was a really clean, may not be that long a break, but it

52:07.720 --> 52:13.280
was a very clean break because I didn't basically didn't, almost didn't code for like three

52:13.280 --> 52:17.440
weeks and it was just a completely, a complete change in that environment as well.

52:17.440 --> 52:18.440
Okay, cool.

52:18.440 --> 52:20.600
Thanks for sharing that.

52:20.600 --> 52:27.680
So I think in closing, and this one leads kind of nicely into it, why do you enjoy doing

52:27.680 --> 52:29.680
outside of the tech world?

52:29.680 --> 52:33.200
I know a lot of times the answer is I still do tech.

52:33.200 --> 52:38.760
If that's the case, that's fine, but I'm curious, like what do you do when you're not doing

52:38.760 --> 52:39.760
tech?

52:39.760 --> 52:40.760
Yeah.

52:40.760 --> 52:41.760
Yeah.

52:41.760 --> 52:48.120
So there's, like everyone else, I really like like traveling.

52:48.120 --> 52:55.400
I'm lucky that I get to do a lot more of that now as a developer advocate, which is fantastic.

52:55.400 --> 53:00.360
I like things to do with music, as I alluded to earlier with like my failure to be good

53:00.360 --> 53:06.680
at any musical instruments, so like playing it, listening to it, attending concerts.

53:06.680 --> 53:10.800
Another thing is, I guess, kind of like your answer a little bit is that I just like learning

53:10.800 --> 53:13.120
about things on the internet in general.

53:13.120 --> 53:14.480
So it's not necessarily coding.

53:14.480 --> 53:21.080
Like I have a side project like everyone else, let's not be, let's not lie there.

53:21.080 --> 53:23.440
Sometimes I have multiple and you know, it happens.

53:23.440 --> 53:29.240
But yeah, I just like getting into like random topics, like in like I think for about like

53:29.240 --> 53:36.160
maybe about a year now, I've got really into like musical theater and I just learned everything

53:36.160 --> 53:40.560
as much as I could about it and like learning the history of it, how different like composers

53:40.560 --> 53:47.680
like relate to each other and like just musically also was just extremely rich discovery.

53:47.680 --> 53:51.640
So like stuff like that, I also really like, which is kind of like doing tech a little

53:51.640 --> 53:53.120
bit, but not exactly.

53:53.120 --> 53:54.120
Yeah.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.120
Yeah.

53:55.120 --> 53:58.120
What is it about travel that you enjoy?

53:58.120 --> 54:03.800
I mean, it's a pretty, I guess, standard answer is like you're, well, it takes you out of

54:03.800 --> 54:09.560
your environment, which is great also for like, you know, it's for your mind and everything

54:09.560 --> 54:10.560
else.

54:10.560 --> 54:15.240
Like that's really good to, you know, to see other things and it's just, you know, learning

54:15.240 --> 54:22.440
about like and seeing just how other cultures work, how, you know, every, you know, every

54:22.440 --> 54:23.440
country works.

54:23.440 --> 54:28.080
You can, you also see a lot of blind spots, which is interesting of like stuff you didn't

54:28.080 --> 54:30.960
think about when you come to another country, you're like, oh my God, they totally fixed

54:30.960 --> 54:31.960
it.

54:31.960 --> 54:35.080
Or like, oh my God, this thing is absolutely terrible in this country.

54:35.080 --> 54:38.520
How did like, we figured this, we figured this out 10 years ago.

54:38.520 --> 54:43.440
How come this country hasn't, but like, it goes both ways.

54:43.440 --> 54:47.840
And yeah, it's just, it's just really good for, you know, just your mind and also just

54:47.840 --> 54:53.280
seeing different things, like, you know, in like seeing completely different nature and

54:53.280 --> 54:56.800
like different people, customs, it's just so interesting.

54:56.800 --> 54:57.800
Yeah.

54:57.800 --> 54:58.800
I agree.

54:58.800 --> 55:04.280
I wish I didn't have as much of an impact on our carbon footprint as it does.

55:04.280 --> 55:11.200
And I mean, sometimes, sometimes you can find beauty and uniqueness within your own country

55:11.200 --> 55:17.400
and you don't have to necessarily get on a plane, not, not unless you're driving an electric

55:17.400 --> 55:18.400
car.

55:18.400 --> 55:22.760
It's not like cars don't have an impact on, but I think they have less of an impact, less

55:22.760 --> 55:26.520
of a carbon footprint than a, than a big ass airplane.

55:26.520 --> 55:29.560
Oh, thank you so much, Alvin.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.240
This has been really a good conversation.

55:31.240 --> 55:37.440
I enjoyed it and I'm kind of sad to be, you have to end it a little early, probably, probably

55:37.440 --> 55:45.480
get going for a while, but yeah, I am going to die without electricity and internet for

55:45.480 --> 55:46.480
a while.

55:46.480 --> 55:49.400
So there's a problem that we haven't solved that a lot of other countries have solved.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.400
Yep.

55:50.400 --> 55:56.160
But yeah, thank you so much for, for taking some time out of your day to speak with me.

55:56.160 --> 55:57.960
I really appreciate it.

55:57.960 --> 56:01.860
And I'm going to look into a lot of these things that you've mentioned and I'll be following

56:01.860 --> 56:05.520
all your work on Twitter and Polywork and everywhere where you are.

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
Thanks so much.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.520
No, thank you.

56:07.520 --> 56:13.400
And I'm happy to be on again, you know, to have another, another chat for sure.

56:13.400 --> 56:14.400
Thank you so much for having me.

56:14.400 --> 56:15.400
For sure.

56:15.400 --> 56:16.400
It's a huge pleasure.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.400
