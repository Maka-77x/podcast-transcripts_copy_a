00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Welcome to the Marseillean Network Podcast, a podcast all about early-stage web developers

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
and the mentors and teachers that help them along the way.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,200
Hey, Alvin.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,000
Thank you so much for joining me today on this Thursday.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,880
I'm always supposed to be on track for time this week.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,880
Thanks so much for joining me.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm really looking forward to our conversation.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
I am too.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,440
Thank you so much for having me on.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
Yeah, pleasure.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,640
So, as I start with all my guests, I'm not going to tell your story.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,000
I think you can do it better than I can.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,800
So instead of that, I'm going to give you the floor and take as much time as you need,

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
as I always say.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,400
Go as far back into your history as you'd like and bring us up to the current day and

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,760
just tell us a bit more about you.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
For sure.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,480
So, hey, I'm Alvin.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,880
I've been in the industry for a while.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,520
Primarily, I worked as a front-end type person.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,720
So I was always driven by the same idea of like, how can I make like things that look

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,680
and feel nice to the user so that whether it's beautiful, fun, entertaining.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,520
And that took like a few forms, I guess.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,600
I worked on games, I worked on data visualizations, I worked on most recently designed systems.

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,720
And now, a new sort of turn in my career is I've been, since the month of May this year,

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,160
so about four months, four or five months, a developer advocate at Contentful.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
Cool.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Yeah.

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
I like the design systems angle.

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,040
I wonder if you want to dig into that a little bit, because I know that is something that

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,320
I'm pretty passionate about.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,120
I had a couple of clients that I was at.

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,120
They were playing very fast and loose with their brand.

34
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,560
And it's not, you know, it's not their fault if there isn't any structure.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,360
But then, if you approach them as this idea of a design system, they're a little hesitant

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,880
because they're like, how much time is this going to take?

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
I was like...

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Always.

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
What's the...

40
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
What's the value of it?

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
You know?

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Yeah.

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
It's going to take a little bit of time.

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,480
But just let me paint you a picture of the future and what it might be like once you

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
have this thing in place.

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,880
Do you want to dig a little bit more into design systems and what they are and maybe

47
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,400
even try and answer some of those questions?

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,960
Yeah, for sure.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,880
So for me, I guess what interested me in design systems is that it's the place where developers

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,040
and designers have to collaborate, right?

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
It's like...

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,680
And that's always been the sweet spot for me, where the more design-driven something

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,760
is, usually the more I like it.

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,840
And I found that design systems were this, but at the larger scale.

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,440
As much as I was interested in very large, complex front ends that had lots of moving

56
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,320
parts with 50 people working on something, a design system, on the other hand, is much

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,800
more interesting because you have your designers and your developers working together in making

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
something, right?

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,400
And that was always the cool thing for me.

60
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:08,800
In terms of, again, application for the brand, when a design system is well put together,

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,000
it's just really satisfying when you can create a sub page or a landing page really quickly

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
because you're just putting blocks together and then you're like, okay, I've got the boring

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:25,880
bits, done, and now I can focus on the more bespoke, interactive, interesting things.

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,520
Otherwise, if you're always trying to find the same nav and the same sub menu or whatever

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,400
and you're having to code that or just lift and shift that in a non-standard way, you

66
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,320
can just waste a bunch of time recoding the same things.

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,360
Whereas if you have everything that's ready, you could just say, okay, put the blocks together,

68
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,680
boom, nav, boom, headings.

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Everything has the right font size, the right spacing.

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,760
You don't have to peer into Figma too much or Sketch or whatever, but everything's already

71
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
done for you.

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,320
So everything is neat and tidy very quickly.

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,360
But the bespoke bit that you need, then you have more time for it.

74
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,400
Did that make any sense?

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
100%.

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,760
No, 100% agree.

77
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,840
I think that is one of the big things about the design system because it's not just the

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,640
design, it's also the components that comes out of the design.

79
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,320
And those are actual living, breathing pieces of code that you can then compose together.

80
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,000
And I think maybe React was the framework that really started making friendly people

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,200
think about components, but I mean, now it's in everything.

82
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,080
It's actually baked into the web platform.

83
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,880
We have web components, it's in the name.

84
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,040
So I think the next evolution is, what do they call them?

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Design tokens.

86
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,520
I think that's the next evolution of design systems.

87
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,440
And there's this ability to cross-share design tokens between systems like Figma, Benpot,

88
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,480
and then like your development environment where you literally export like a JSON definition

89
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,500
and you have these tools that can take that and generate code.

90
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,480
I used this one from Adobe where basically you have that and then you can tell it like

91
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,520
generate me the style sheets for, I put it in quotes because it's more than just style

92
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,240
sheets, for web, iOS, Android, blah, blah, and it's like just root all from the single

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
JSON thing.

94
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,560
And then once the designers make the changes in Figma, say for example, and they export

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:33,080
the latest version, it like just does like a automatic re-roll and I'm looking forward

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,560
to that being more of a thing.

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,320
It's still early days there, but at this point you have to do quite a bit of hacking to get

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,320
it to work really efficiently, but I'm looking forward to the future of what that can be.

99
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,860
So I noticed a post that you wrote called, learning to code in a time of crisis.

100
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,400
I love the title, it intrigues me, so I automatically want to know more.

101
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,280
And I think that probably ties into one of the other questions I often ask, which is,

102
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,280
what advice do you have for early stage web developers or developers in general on how

103
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,080
to stay motivated?

104
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
Right.

105
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,800
So I'm going to start with like the post, the blog post, learning to code in time of

106
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,920
crisis first, and then I'll sort of find advice from that.

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:32,480
So my idea with this post, which was interesting because I started writing it in 2020, in March,

108
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,040
when the whole world shut down, we know what happened, I had a couple of people ask me

109
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,460
whether it was easy to find a job as a coder and if it was something they could break into,

110
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,560
so I started writing it, started outlining it, and then I wasn't super happy with it

111
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,200
and I sort of shelved it because as you know, in 2021, the economy kicked back again, then

112
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,880
we had this boom in tech which seemed was going to last forever, but it didn't.

113
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,800
In 2022, the economy is in a pickle again.

114
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,600
And I had also another person ask me the same question and I was like, you know what, I'm

115
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,200
going to finish it, find another angle to it, and that's what I did.

116
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,680
So the blog post has a couple of things in it.

117
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:27,600
The first main point is the job market sucks right now if you're trying to break into it

118
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,800
as a beginner, but that doesn't mean it's impossible and you just want to be realistic

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
with it.

120
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,300
It's like even if you heard these stories maybe a year ago, two years ago, three years

121
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:45,000
ago of people going from zero to great coding job in three, six months, it may happen to

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,120
you again, but it's just less likely.

123
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,440
So just got to be realistic with the state of the tech market right now.

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,340
That doesn't mean, as I said, it's impossible, but just want to be realistic.

125
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,720
So that's like with the negatives.

126
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,780
With the positives though, the great thing is the tech industry is used to people coming

127
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:12,440
from a variety of backgrounds and going from the most random jobs to coding.

128
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,920
I think I have a bunch of examples there.

129
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,320
But yeah, so it's not a foreign thing to do, it's not to say that there's zero elitism

130
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,640
in the tech industry, it exists everywhere, but we're used to people jumping from different

131
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,160
careers so we will not be looked at weirdly or if you think your case is really unusual

132
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
like, oh, but I don't know, I'm coming from this very specific background, it's probably

133
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,120
someone else who did something similar.

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:47,780
That's one part and also with developers in particular and designers too, remote work

135
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,960
is definitely a thing now.

136
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,760
So if you think about it in a way that if you're looking for a job, you have access

137
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,740
to companies, of course, you can go as far as you want on the entire planet, some people

138
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,120
work across multiple time zones and everything, but even within your own country, even if

139
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,240
you think, okay, just within my own country, I can apply to pretty much any company there,

140
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,520
not any but like a ton of companies there who do remote work, that's a huge advantage

141
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,720
compared to whatever job, if you're a nurse or something that needs you to move your life

142
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,560
around, what about your partner, what about your children?

143
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
And that's amazing.

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,040
I mean, there's tons of companies that work across countries, across time zones, like

145
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,920
you in South Africa, you're in the same time zone as Germany, for example, so you could

146
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,400
work with a German company like me, right?

147
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,880
But even if you think at the smaller scale of like, okay, just my own country, that's

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:49,880
already a huge advantage and so they're good and there's bad and it's still a good thing

149
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,720
to learn, but just be realistic that the market is weird at the moment.

150
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,560
Yeah, what do you think is weird about it?

151
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:11,400
Do you think it's that maybe the opportunities that exist require a certain amount of experience

152
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,480
and that is the problem for early stage folks is they lack that experience and so while

153
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,880
there might be a shortage of skills, it's more a shortage of skills of experienced developers,

154
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:32,560
not so much new developers, or do you think companies are hesitant towards hiring juniors?

155
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,680
The problem right now is that there were a ton of layoffs, so you have a huge pool of

156
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,440
experienced coders that are on the market, so that's the problem.

157
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,440
If you have one opening, you'll probably get the most experience because you can, right?

158
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,680
Because there was all these layoffs happening, but again, it depends, it doesn't mean it's

159
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,800
impossible, it's just harder than it used to be when you had more of an equal distribution

160
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,200
of people of all levels entering the market.

161
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Now you have this ton of layoffs, you have a ton of people with experience that are being

162
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,120
dumped into the markets looking for jobs at the same time, so it's harder.

163
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:22,480
I just hope it will balance out in the near future, but at least in the summer, just for

164
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,960
people listening to this in the future, since the spring of 2022, we had basically non-stop

165
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:35,240
big layoffs happening all the time, and we're recording this in September, early October,

166
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,160
so in the past four months, it's been non-stop, company X laid off 1,000 tech workers, company

167
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:50,080
B laid off 500, so it's just really hitting it hard, but I hope it will balance out.

168
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,440
But as you said, there's still a shortage of developers, people are still struggling

169
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,000
to find them, so that's not going to disappear, and more, as we know, technology is eating

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,200
our lives, so I don't see that stopping, but yeah, the market conditions are a bit weird

171
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
at the moment.

172
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,760
Yeah, that's a good point, yeah, I don't think about that, that's a very good insight.

173
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:19,160
So with that, with that challenge, I think already for early stage developers and people

174
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,720
switching careers and stuff like that, it's already stressful, a little scary, and now

175
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,760
you have this added thing that you just mentioned, where it's like, oh, now I'm competing against

176
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,480
somebody with five years experience, I'm stuffed, how would you, any advice on how to stay motivated

177
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,920
and just keep going, keep trying, don't give up?

178
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:51,920
For sure, yeah, I think keep at it, as you said, and be consistent, even if you'll, so

179
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,840
it's a bit of a weirdly worded way of saying it, but keep at it, be consistent, even if

180
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:03,040
you'll see inconsistency like everything else, because learning everything, your progress

181
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,960
will not be linear, so it's like learning a musical instrument or anything, sometimes

182
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,000
you're going to make a ton of progress in a couple of weeks, and then you really struggle

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,320
for like three or four, and then it's going to go up and down like this, and it's not

184
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,960
easy, and my own personal failure to be any good at any musical instrument can attest

185
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,960
to that, so yeah, somehow with coding it worked.

186
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,120
I guess with coding maybe it's easier to see progress, because you can visually see your

187
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,600
programs becoming more complicated, whereas maybe with a musical instrument you're just

188
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,240
getting a little bit faster, maybe I'm just making excuses, doesn't matter, but yeah,

189
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,440
so going back to the word of advice, yeah, keep at it, it will be inconsistent, and keep

190
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,760
the end goal in mind, and have an achievable end goal, so if you think, okay, I want to

191
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,400
build up a portfolio of work that includes Project X, make sure you have that in mind,

192
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,520
and you keep thinking, okay, I'm moving towards that goal, rather than just like have this

193
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,280
abstract thing like, I'm going to learn Python, you know, like, yes, you know, but it's very

194
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,360
easy to fizzle out when you have a goal like this, just learn Python, what does that mean,

195
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
you know?

196
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,960
Yeah, I'm definitely a very goal-oriented person, I've mentioned it in previous episodes

197
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,840
of the podcast, I find it very difficult to learn something for the sake of learning it,

198
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,320
I always need an outlet for it, like I need, you know, either something I can contribute

199
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,760
to that uses the technology I'm learning, so I can like apply what I learn, or just

200
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,400
scratching on my own itch, or even make up my own little project, even if it's like just

201
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:56,880
for me, just as a means of using the skills I'm learning, if I feel I'm just like making

202
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,420
the little food app that you're doing as part of the course, it doesn't feel as fulfilling

203
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:10,400
to me, and because a lot of the courses like feed off each other, which is good, it's like

204
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,680
music where, you know, the music you make today is influenced by the music from the

205
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,980
past, and so sometimes you'll hear a band and you'll say, I hear a little bit of Rolling

206
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,320
Stones in there with weeks with a little bit of Beatles, and it's good, I mean, it's good,

207
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,880
I heard, I don't know, the artist Grimes, I listened to an interview with her, I'm not

208
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,160
a fan of her music or anything, but she's a very fascinating person, and she says, music

209
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,080
is like having a conversation with those who came before you, and I think that was really

210
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:48,120
just beautiful, and so yeah, I think the same thing here, I do think it's good that these

211
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:55,640
course materials are feeding off each other and improving through that, but maybe they

212
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,680
should look at expanding the portfolio of examples you build, so it's not like you're

213
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,560
building just another food app, another to-do app, because that can get tedious.

214
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,600
I wanted to jump into a different problem, now I'm thinking if I should first flip to

215
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,160
a different topic or we should just keep going, I think let's just keep going on this road.

216
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,140
So I think you've highlighted some of these things, but maybe we can dig into it more.

217
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,960
From your perspective, what do you think are the biggest problems in the tech industry?

218
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:36,560
Yeah, so I generally don't like thinking absolute statements like their biggest, but I think

219
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,840
a big problem we have that is recognized still is diversity, even though we've improved a

220
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
lot.

221
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,080
Don't get me wrong, the tech workforce of today looks nothing like the tech workforce

222
00:16:53,080 --> 00:17:01,760
of five, six, seven years ago, really improved a lot in that regard, but it's still a problem.

223
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,640
We still know we need to have more diverse voices and it kind of feeds off with what

224
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,720
we were talking about with having people from different backgrounds, right?

225
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:22,920
The more we have people that come in with a fresh eye from a random job before, the

226
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,400
better our product is going to be, right?

227
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,880
And so this is something that the tech industry knows there's a problem and we're trying to

228
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,320
fix it, but it's more aware that there's still a problem.

229
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,920
And then coming back, I guess, to what we were saying, this is also where it's interesting

230
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,520
where people would hire you because you were talking as a beginner, because when you were

231
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,400
talking about earlier about how the hell do I compete with someone who has five years,

232
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,800
maybe even if you don't have as many actual years, maybe there's something about your

233
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,120
background and about yourself and about the way you see design and accessibility that

234
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,160
is unique to you and someone who's been working on a very specific thing for five years cannot

235
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,800
contribute to the company and the product.

236
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:16,520
So that also is, I guess, like a beacon of hope, I guess, for people breaking in, trying

237
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,680
to break into the industry.

238
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,560
Yeah, I think that leads me to a different topic also, which is interviews.

239
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:35,080
And I think there is where we have another problem with tech, and I think this one might

240
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,200
be very tech specific.

241
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,800
I think generally the diversity problem is not just a tech problem, it's very visible

242
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,240
in tech and it's been made very visible and that's good.

243
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,640
I mean, it needs to be visible before anybody's going to do anything about it.

244
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,080
It's like we saw with COVID, like it was very visible that we have a problem, like the world

245
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,960
rallied around it.

246
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,040
So that's important.

247
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:07,680
But I think the other side with the interviews is if you take a junior through the same interview

248
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,560
process as somebody with five years experience, generally the person with five years experience

249
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,560
are going to win every time.

250
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,080
Because if you don't ask those questions, like what you said, like, why do you bring

251
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
to the project that's unique, if you don't dig into that side of it and you just focus

252
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,520
on the wide-forged algorithm things, the junior is going to lose that interview every time.

253
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,680
And I can see how that can be demotivational.

254
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,680
So I think with tech interviews, the one thing that we need to, but I think this is also

255
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:45,320
a little bit, I don't want to be the person who always puts the burden on the other person

256
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,280
and like give the recruiters an out.

257
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:57,340
But I do think as an applicant to a job, you need to speak to those things.

258
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,640
You need to speak to what you can bring, not just from a technical perspective, but from

259
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,320
how you think about stuff.

260
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:13,720
And I think one of the previous folks I spoke to, Adelson Sandoval, he made a point of that,

261
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,800
like how important it is to understand the company that you're applying to, understanding

262
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,240
their technology and maybe even coming to the table with some ideas because you've taken

263
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,400
the time to research what the company does, what their goals are.

264
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,960
And it's easier, of course, if the company has an open source aspect to them, because

265
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,800
you can literally see the code, you can literally see what they do.

266
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,480
And through that, you might see some stuff.

267
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,200
But I think also just in general, companies should be open to the idea that a junior can

268
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,960
bring something to the table that a senior might not, even if it's just in the way that

269
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,680
they're going to ask questions about stuff that other people have stopped thinking about,

270
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,400
because it feels like it's just part of your DNA now.

271
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,360
Yeah, absolutely.

272
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm a huge proponent of hiring juniors.

273
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,160
I think there's lots of values.

274
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
It's someone with fresh eyes.

275
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
That's what it is, really.

276
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:18,520
And that has a ton of value, especially if you're a company of the same kind of people

277
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,920
who have been building the same product for a while.

278
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,240
It's hard to see what's going on with fresh eyes.

279
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,520
And coming back to what you said about maybe not liking to always throw the burden to someone

280
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
else.

281
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,440
But the someone else is us, though.

282
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,000
It's developers when we're hiring others.

283
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,280
It's like when you have an opening in your team.

284
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,900
It's us knowing, do we really want to give them a four-hour take-home test?

285
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,720
Do we really need that?

286
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,560
It's us pushing back.

287
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:52,220
Or something I'm also a big advocate of is if we do think, because it's a more senior

288
00:21:52,220 --> 00:22:00,400
position or whatever, that a three-hour take-home test is the way to go, then pay the person.

289
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,080
So yeah, I feel like it's on us.

290
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,720
It's on us developers thinking in terms of recruiting.

291
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,960
It's not just the recruiters.

292
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,760
It's how we word our job description as well.

293
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,880
Do we need to have so much like...

294
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,840
There's even internal jargon sometimes.

295
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Sometimes I see this.

296
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,440
And it's like we're part of the Prometheus group within Facebook or whatever.

297
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,320
And I'm like, what the hell is a Prometheus group?

298
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Why do I care?

299
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,600
It's an applicant.

300
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,840
And it's like sometimes you see things like this.

301
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,420
And yeah, it's on us to make sure that we're...

302
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,780
We're always super keen to share our job posting on LinkedIn and whatever and be like, come

303
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780
work with me.

304
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
And I do that too.

305
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
Don't get me wrong.

306
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,760
But it's also on us to make sure that the job description we share makes sense.

307
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,320
And that we have our hiring process nailed and we're not like, oh, what are we doing?

308
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
I don't know.

309
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,880
Let's give them a three-hour home test.

310
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
What?

311
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
I don't know.

312
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
Let's do a to-do list as well.

313
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Yay.

314
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,240
But then when you're an applicant, if you have three companies giving you that, it starts

315
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,000
to add up and it's...

316
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's it.

317
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,800
It starts to add up and it starts to be annoying.

318
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:11,080
Whereas if it's more like, okay, we're just going to come on Zoom for an hour, have them

319
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,460
walk through code or just do a simple code example of like, hey, can you fetch something

320
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,080
from the GitHub API, walk us through it?

321
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Something like that.

322
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
That's a way...

323
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,440
In my opinion, that's a way better interview process because you're not requiring a ton

324
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,760
of commitment.

325
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,820
You're still looking at how the person is coding, but you're not placing this huge burden

326
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,520
on them to find three hours spare time and polish an app and do whatever.

327
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,040
And again, that multiplied by every company you're applying to, right?

328
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:50,600
So yeah, I feel like it's on us as developers with a bit of experience who are going to

329
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,920
be in the position to hire someone else to make sure that our process is as accessible

330
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
as it can be.

331
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Yeah.

332
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Yeah.

333
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,240
That's very good.

334
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,400
I wonder with that hour long interview where you do something, would you give somebody

335
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,160
like a hint as to what the question might be?

336
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,800
You don't necessarily will tell them you're going to be using the GitHub API, but maybe

337
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,760
you'll tell them we're going to have this hour long conversation and basically as part

338
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,120
of that, we will have you do a request to an API to get some data and display it on

339
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
a webpage.

340
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,160
Would you put that in?

341
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,520
I think it depends on, again, the seniority level, what kind of things you're solving

342
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,520
because for example, sometimes you're more interested in the presentation, right?

343
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,320
So you're like, okay, we'll give you like with that same example, right?

344
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,280
So you can be really interested in how someone writes the tests for this request to the API.

345
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,700
That could be like a primary focus or it could be, yeah, just get something from this API,

346
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,760
but what we really want you to focus on is make sure the, I don't know if you have a

347
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,700
search or something or whatever you're displaying from the API, make sure that it's accessible.

348
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,160
So it really depends what you're looking for in the role, but yeah, I think you drop hints

349
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:22,960
based on what you're trying to have them focus on versus if it's a pure front end and you

350
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,480
want someone who really knows about accessibility and it's something that they've said in their

351
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,080
CV as well, you don't want them to spend 20 minutes figuring out there's a missing header

352
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,320
to that API or whatever.

353
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,720
You could just help them with that because that's not the primary thing.

354
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Gotcha.

355
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Gotcha.

356
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Yeah, that sounds like a very healthy approach.

357
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
I really like that.

358
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm glad more people did that, more companies.

359
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
That's good.

360
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:52,040
I'm glad you've said that and now it's out there for people to listen to and take note.

361
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,800
This leads us into this next question, which is I noticed a tweet from you about CascadiaJS

362
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,320
and they mentioned that they post all the recordings of their events because they believe

363
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,240
in open sourcing knowledge.

364
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,340
Love that, by the way.

365
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:13,320
And so I wonder, what are your thoughts with regards to open source, the open source ecosystem

366
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,880
and its role in developer education?

367
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,920
Because especially I think it touches on that topic previously, which we talked about, about

368
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,800
Junior's lack of experience, lack of working experience.

369
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,840
Can open source play a role here?

370
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,160
For sure.

371
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,280
As you mentioned before, with open source, what's great, you can see real code.

372
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,800
You can see if someone has a small project, they open source it.

373
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,920
You can see, okay, this is how this specific app works.

374
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,580
It allows you to explore and to see a real code in action, which is great.

375
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:53,140
Especially now with things like Netlify and Versailles, it's a lot easier to host things

376
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:58,820
than it was before because before it was like, oh, I have to do whatever.

377
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,440
People tend to just have a GitHub and that just automatically publishes to Netlify or

378
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,720
something and it makes it easier to say, oh, okay, I got this code and it's powering this

379
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
page.

380
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,220
And you know, there's no in between.

381
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,060
This is the build step.

382
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,320
It's all in there and it's all visible.

383
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
So that's great.

384
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,480
I feel like in terms of developer education, though, we now have more of a curation problem

385
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,440
than a number of resources problem.

386
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,600
I feel like there's a ton of knowledge and it's fantastic.

387
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,740
We're extremely lucky that we have tons of people writing tutorials in their spare time

388
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,000
on their blogs and stuff.

389
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,160
So there's a lot of knowledge going around.

390
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,720
But we might have more of a, as I said, curation problem in that we need to figure out how

391
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,500
to triage all the tutorials and everything to make sure, okay, this is what I need to

392
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,240
build a specific thing.

393
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,720
But yeah, otherwise, I think it's fantastic.

394
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,600
Yeah, I agree 100% of that.

395
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,000
I think Riku from the very first podcast said, you feel like you're this little drop that

396
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,320
fell into this ocean and you don't know if it's some up or down or left or right.

397
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,360
Because you're like drowning, drowning in information.

398
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,920
I think we are there.

399
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,800
And I think one of the projects that we are undertaking as part of the Mycelium Network

400
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:24,680
is the web workbook, which is not meant to be, let's try and do a better MDN.

401
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,400
No, it's the opposite.

402
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,680
Let's, let's, let's curate content.

403
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,840
And let's, let's define pathways, topics, technology paths.

404
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,800
And let's as a, as a community, share things that have helped us and let's try and make

405
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,120
it easier for people to know, okay, I've finished this part, where do I go from here?

406
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,800
What are the content that I can trust?

407
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:55,920
Who are the people I should be following that shares really good, that has a teaching style

408
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,960
that works really well, and also finding different ways of learning because not everybody likes

409
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,380
to read, not everybody likes to watch a video.

410
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,720
Some people like me are very, very practical.

411
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,520
So you want something that has a practical aspect to it.

412
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,680
So kind of trying to curate stuff around topics, technologies and pathways.

413
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,040
It's a big, it's a big undertaking, but I think I'm hearing it more and more and more

414
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,200
that this is what is needed.

415
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,560
Like speaking to, to early stage developers, it's, it's almost, I don't think I've spoken

416
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,320
to one that has not said this.

417
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,680
So the fact that you also brought it up is just like, it's clear that that is something

418
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
that's needed.

419
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,240
And I'm really excited about that project, but you know, it's still early days and there's

420
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,040
a lot, there's a lot to do, a lot of planning, there's a lot of planning.

421
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,500
And I think that's one of the things that is interesting about people who are getting

422
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,440
into code is they don't realize how big a part of the job that is, is planning.

423
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,280
Sure, you're going to write a lot of code probably, but you're also going to spend a

424
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,320
lot of time planning before you write all the code.

425
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,600
Friend of mine, Peter has the famous thing where he says, writing the code is the easy

426
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,280
part.

427
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,480
Understanding the problem and finding a solution, that is, that is the hard part.

428
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,680
And then it's almost like you take your crypt notes and you just turn it into code.

429
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,200
It's, it's oversimplified, of course, but I like the statement, I like the way he phrases

430
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
it.

431
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,760
Yeah, that's really cool.

432
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,760
So I, another thing that I saw about you, and it makes me think that you are somebody

433
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:40,560
and I in that same camp that like ethical tech or like are passionate about ethical

434
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,240
tech.

435
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,920
You mentioned on the rise of Signal, I use Signal myself.

436
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:56,720
I've used it before the web app, the WhatsApp debacle, but I kind of still used WhatsApp

437
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,960
at that point because some of the family and things were on there, you know, that's the

438
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:07,120
common problem, but like I've gotten off all of that stuff.

439
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:15,080
I just decided that for me personally, I need to, I need to put my money where my mouth is.

440
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,440
That's not entirely correct, but you know what I'm trying to say?

441
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,840
So I like to hear your views on what you think about ethical tech and its role in improving

442
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,320
the tech world and the world maybe even in general.

443
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Yeah.

444
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,560
So this, so you're talking about the blog post that I wrote as well about like, again,

445
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:44,880
the rise of Signal and the, again, my thesis there was that when Signal got the spotlight,

446
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,680
it already had all the ingredients to succeed.

447
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,160
Basically it had roughly the same features of WhatsApp.

448
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,200
It was already a polished product because the problem you have with more ethical tech

449
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,600
in general, and you could think of this as in the broadest sense possible of like it's

450
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,800
more ethical because it's open source, because it doesn't have like a giant weird company

451
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
behind it or whatever.

452
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,860
So the problem we have with usually with this type of tech is that it's just not as good.

453
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,160
Like it doesn't have like the same level of visual flair or whatever than the mainstream

454
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
thing.

455
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,680
So people are kind of stuck with like the old thing because the usability is not right.

456
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,580
And when Signal had its moment, it's what I put in the article as well, it had a big

457
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:37,960
boost because Elon Musk tweeted just two words, use Signal, right?

458
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,880
And it's credited with like, suddenly all the newspapers were talking about it and like

459
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,280
he already has a huge account, but people also like retweeted it to hell.

460
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,280
But my thesis is that if he had tweeted, use Linux, no one would care.

461
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,160
Because Linux is not there yet in terms of like, oh, I can just, it's just like, I can

462
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,000
just flip a button and suddenly my, I have a perfect, you know, I have the same thing,

463
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,360
I have the same apps, everything looks great.

464
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,760
And it's very easy to install.

465
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,720
Like I know I might get some heat from like Linux users from this, but like, it's not

466
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,560
as easy as, you know, just like a Mac, things are not as intuitive.

467
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,800
Again, there's lots of progress being made there.

468
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,200
I don't want to like, you know, undermine that.

469
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,600
Like this also got a lot more accessible than it was.

470
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,360
Like, you know, in the, if you're talking about like Linux, even 10 years ago or even

471
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,040
the worst in the like 2005 ish, it was impossible.

472
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:38,880
You had to like go into the command line thing to install whatever, but like, yeah.

473
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,600
So it's getting better, but we're still, we're still have ways to go.

474
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,640
And that was the idea of the blog post about ethical tech in general.

475
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,640
To me, it's usually when like what you want in tech is to as much as possible is for incentives

476
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,000
to be aligned, right?

477
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,520
So to give you a counterexample, that's not the case with social media, right?

478
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,240
They have no incentive to, I don't want not to like, I'm not going to name a specific

479
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,280
company, but they have no incentive to make media that's actually increase, you know,

480
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,800
that is social.

481
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,860
What they want to do is put you on, is for you to stay on the platform for as long as

482
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,800
possible because you can see more ads, right?

483
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:28,020
And they do this with, you know, by creating outrage, fear, whatever, you know, controversy.

484
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,880
And that's not by making a media that makes people sociable and, you know, people want

485
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
to interact.

486
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,280
Because if you just see some funny, you know, good vibe things for 10 minutes and you leave,

487
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
that's not what they want.

488
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,080
You know, it's not in their interest, right?

489
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:47,960
So as a result, the incentives are completely misaligned, whereas I'm going to like use

490
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,680
the example of another company that I like.

491
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,960
And I think I can start to recommend because they're starting to be as good as the alternative,

492
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,280
like with ProtonMail, for example, like they're all about like building an email that's private.

493
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,240
The day they are caught selling ads, everyone of their customer will leave.

494
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,400
So they have, you know, their interests are aligned with what they're preaching to be,

495
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
right?

496
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,060
It's like we want to make a private email.

497
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,720
So as a result, we know they can sell data or they can be hacked because the day that

498
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,120
happens, they know they're going to lose like 50% of their customers at least.

499
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:30,020
And again, like talking, using the example of ProtonMail, like if we had this conversation

500
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,080
two years ago, I would not be able to recommend ProtonMail to you because they didn't have

501
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:39,080
a calendar, like, you know, it didn't have like things like dark mode.

502
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,960
It still looked a little bit clunky.

503
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,480
Like if you received, again, a Google Calendar invite, you couldn't do anything with it.

504
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,440
Now you could just press the same button that you have in Gmail that says, yes, I would

505
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
like to attend.

506
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,920
Boom, you press that and that's it.

507
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,640
So it's a similar enough experience that it's an alternative that's ethical and good, right?

508
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,960
It's like you're not losing too much by like switching to the ethical product.

509
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,440
Yeah, and I think there's another case happening right now with Penpot and Figma.

510
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,160
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right.

511
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,760
Yeah, Figma was bought by Adobe.

512
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:26,400
A lot of people are not happy about that, to say the least, and I mean, I think it's

513
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,500
a complicated one because it's not like Figma is not a good fit for Adobe as a company.

514
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,520
It is the history of Adobe and what they've done to products that they've purchased.

515
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,760
That's the scary part here.

516
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,280
And even though the CEO, Figma, said that, no, no, no, we're going to operate as an independent

517
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,400
company and make our own decisions, but we do get access to all of this power of Adobe

518
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,240
that they've developed over the years.

519
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,440
It sounds good, but I don't know how true that really is.

520
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
That's what everyone thinks.

521
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
It's like, yeah, sure.

522
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Yeah, you got 20 billion for sure.

523
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Sure.

524
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
Yeah.

525
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:13,840
And then yesterday I saw Penpot announced they have an $8 million investment seed round,

526
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,320
which means their blog post literally said, our time has come.

527
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,280
And I'm really excited about that.

528
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,600
And I have personally started using the two tools in tandem because like you said, when

529
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,920
the WhatsApp thing happened, Signal had all the ingredients to just take its place.

530
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,240
Penpot is close, but not quite there.

531
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,040
Like I found some bugs which I'm raising.

532
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Like this is open source.

533
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
It's awesome.

534
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,440
I can just go and tell them, this is the thing I'm seeing and maybe I can maybe even help

535
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
fix the problem.

536
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:54,280
Because currently if I drag an SVG into it and some of the elements has color, all the

537
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:00,640
color disappears and they either render them invisible or white or it renders that it's

538
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
all black.

539
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,640
And then you have to go in and edit it in Penpot.

540
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,040
So there's a bug there.

541
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:13,840
But then the other thing that I miss badly is auto layout.

542
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,840
That is not in Penpot yet and that is a big feature.

543
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,920
And then I think the community plug-in stuff that the ecosystem that Figma has built, that's

544
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,720
something that's missing as well.

545
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,500
But with them having this $8 million investment and being open source and having a community

546
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,240
that's now like, yeah, we need to support this project.

547
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,520
I think all these gaps can be filled very, very quickly.

548
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,080
And they are going to be filled very, very quickly.

549
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,680
So I'm really excited about that and I'm definitely following that and seeing how I can help make

550
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,760
Penpot be the successor of Figma.

551
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,680
But with ProtonMail, I've been actually toying with that idea because I did see their announcement

552
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,800
when they're like, now we have a VPN, we have a drive kind of thing, like Google Drive,

553
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,440
we have calendaring, we have better, our email is better.

554
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,880
And I tried it for a bit and it looks beautiful.

555
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,600
And it has some functionality actually that Gmail doesn't.

556
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:20,280
And the company I run called Mechanical Ink, I'm in the stage where I'm trying to define

557
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,320
what the company, what I want the company to be because I don't want it to be another

558
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
agency.

559
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
I don't want that.

560
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,440
At the moment, it kind of is because it pays the bills, right?

561
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,800
But that is not the long-term thing.

562
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,160
What I want it to be is a company that is heavily involved in open source and in ethical

563
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,760
civic tech.

564
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,240
And I need to find a way to be able to do that while creating job opportunities and

565
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,520
being able to sustain my own, me and my family and my children.

566
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,000
But as part of that, I mean, cause on the table, I use Google Workspace, right?

567
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,320
For my company stuff.

568
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,440
And I am considering switching to Proton because with what my future vision for the company

569
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:15,040
is, I need to, again, put my money where my words are and say, I'm not going to use Google's

570
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
product for this.

571
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,320
I'm going to use an alternative, an ethical alternative because one does exist and only

572
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:27,160
use tools that don't fit that bill when there really isn't an alternative.

573
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,120
And then asking the question, is there a way that Mechanical Ink and the communities I

574
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:39,600
build can help create this ethical alternative or plant the seeds so that people can come

575
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,120
together and create these ethical alternatives?

576
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:49,160
Wow, that was fun to talk about.

577
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,520
So in the same kind of vein, has there been any person, book, event, anything like this

578
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,960
that was impactful in your life just in general or maybe tech specific?

579
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,360
Yeah, so just to wrap up what we said about like ethical tech, I think an important point

580
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:12,720
too is that it doesn't have to be a full culture key switch right now.

581
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,680
Like what you're talking about, like with Penpot, for example, like right now, Figma

582
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,240
hasn't changed, but we know that if one year something really bad happens, like what everybody

583
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,800
is fearing, which is it's being integrated with the Creative Suite, which is what everyone

584
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,120
is like, please don't make me install Creative Suite, right?

585
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:37,960
But if that happens in a year, Penpot had a year from now to get it stuck together.

586
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
And it's kind of the same thing.

587
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,920
You could say, okay, I'm looking at Proton right now, and maybe in a year I'll switch.

588
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,880
And it's kind of the same thing for Penpot for all these things.

589
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,760
So it's important to know that to have them in your radar, to keep checking as opposed

590
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,220
to go, oh, let me see, can I do a culture key switch today?

591
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,880
And you download it, and it doesn't work, and you forget about it forever.

592
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
I've done that too.

593
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
Don't get me wrong.

594
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,840
But sometimes it's a bit of an easy thing to go...

595
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Because it's easier for your mind.

596
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,000
You don't want to have this thing lingering of like, maybe I should switch to something

597
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
one day.

598
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,840
So it's easier to go one day, look at it, and go, okay, right, is this the most optimal

599
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
thing today?

600
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,120
You look into it, it's like, nope, moving on.

601
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:23,080
But you can say, okay, maybe let's check it in six months or a year.

602
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,840
And also, as you're doing, just sharing something, they shipped something, you were talking about

603
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,960
your SVG bug, when they fix it, if you share it, that's it, it's a little boost, even if

604
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,360
you may not be using them already because of what you said, auto layout.

605
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,720
To go back to your question about was there a person or an event or something that really

606
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,280
impacted my career, I think I will say all the managers that gave me a chance, even if

607
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,880
I didn't specifically fit the profile, I did lots of various things.

608
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,320
And I feel like it also comes back to what we were saying about hiring people with diverse

609
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,900
skill sets and not necessarily the perfect background.

610
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,120
It happened to me a few times, I was lucky that someone was like, even if you don't have

611
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:17,280
the perfect previous experience, I feel like you'll be a good fit here in the team.

612
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,400
And that happened more than once, and every time that really just helped me a lot.

613
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:30,720
I love that, I love that when people are open to giving you a chance and saying, let's see

614
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,560
what you do, and then let's check back in a month.

615
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:41,440
And if you show that you are a curious person who's willing to learn, let's keep going.

616
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,120
I think companies need to be more open to that.

617
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:52,400
So for, like I mentioned, this web workbook project, it's going to be very content heavy.

618
00:43:52,400 --> 00:44:00,440
And so we're going to be building it using Hugo as the static site generators aspect

619
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
of it.

620
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,400
But then we've got a community license from Contentful.

621
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:11,680
And so we intend to use Contentful for our CMS.

622
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,440
So I've read quite a bit about Contentful, and I've used a bunch of other ones like Netlify

623
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,400
CMS, Forestry, and stuff like that.

624
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,840
Can you talk to how Contentful is different, like what sets Contentful apart from all these

625
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
other things?

626
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,320
Because I know there's a lot of these things that's jumped up.

627
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
Yeah.

628
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,560
So that's the great thing about being a developer advocate and not a salesman, is that I don't

629
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,720
have to give you a big sales pitch.

630
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:47,440
What I'll say is Contentful, as you said, I'm glad you're going to be using us, but

631
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,880
even if not, that's fine.

632
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:57,120
So we're a headless content platform that helps all kinds of clients.

633
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:04,120
So I think what I'll say is the great thing about Contentful is we've been at this for

634
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
a while.

635
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:12,960
It's one of the first companies in that space in having this idea of having something headless,

636
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:20,360
having blocks of content, rather than moving from the old paradigm of this is a page.

637
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,520
Everything in WordPress, for example, is a page, so you're with that structure, and you're

638
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,560
hacking around with short codes or whatever.

639
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,200
With Contentful, we have these entries and content types, which can be anything you want,

640
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,560
and that gives you the great flexibility.

641
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,600
So yeah, I'm glad you're using us.

642
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,480
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

643
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,160
So I'm thinking about which way to go next.

644
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:54,360
I think I want to switch on, I noticed that you mentioned your coach also at Codebar.

645
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,280
I have not heard about Codebar before, strangely enough, and I had a quick look at it and it

646
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,200
looks interesting, but you know more about it than me, so I'm going to ask you to inform

647
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,840
me about Codebar, what you do there, and what their mission is, and stuff like that.

648
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
For sure.

649
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,400
So I'm still a new coach too.

650
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,960
So I started in about November, December of 2021 as a coach.

651
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,240
So Codebar is basically a series of meetups that, historically, before COVID, happened

652
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,200
in specific cities.

653
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,040
So you have one in London, in Berlin, in New York, in Edinburgh, I think there's one in

654
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,520
Paris too, anyway.

655
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,240
So in each of these cities, it's a meetup to help people learn to code.

656
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,920
So people who are learning to code come in with their problem, which could be anything,

657
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,520
and they're like, hey, can I get help?

658
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:51,760
And someone, a coach, will help them with that problem for two hours.

659
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,760
And that could be anything.

660
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,080
It could be, hey, I'm doing the free code camp, I'm stuck on chapter three, I'm trying

661
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,760
to load an image and it doesn't work, and you're like, okay, sure, we'll fix that.

662
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,600
Or it could be something, sometimes it's way more involved and like, hey, I already have

663
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,920
this React app, but when I do this thing, I'm trying to query this thing and everything

664
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,920
breaks.

665
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,640
And it's like, okay, cool, let's have a look at this.

666
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,940
And they try to pair coaches with skills.

667
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,880
So when people register in advance, they're like, hey, I need help with Python.

668
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,960
And we're like, well, and Codebar tries to make sure that there's someone who knows Python

669
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,880
in the room, which is easier.

670
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,480
Even though you can usually figure it out, because as an experienced coder, especially

671
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:39,120
if it's an easier problem, sometimes it works across languages, but they try, Codebar tries

672
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:45,400
to optimize the coach's skills with what the student needs.

673
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:54,560
And historically, it was very much oriented towards underrepresented people in the industry.

674
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:03,160
So yeah, the way I coach is on Discord and on Zoom, so you could just rock on to, I think

675
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,880
it's pretty much open to any cities now.

676
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:11,400
Like I've coached in Berlin, I've coached in London, even though I'm in neither city.

677
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:17,400
A bunch more meetups are happening in person now.

678
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,680
So I've been coaching less, plus also other engagements made it difficult.

679
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,800
But yes, so that's the idea.

680
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,800
That's interesting.

681
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:34,400
So it's almost like this group of mentors that is just available to you when you get

682
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,400
stuck.

683
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,400
Yeah.

684
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
That's really, really cool.

685
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,680
And sorry, and they try to pair one to one all the time, at least.

686
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,480
So sometimes you might get two students.

687
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,740
It happens when there aren't enough coaches, but usually they're really good at making

688
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,240
sure that if they got 10 students, they'd make sure we have 10 coaches.

689
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
That's really interesting.

690
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,920
I'm definitely going to have a look at that a bit more.

691
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,720
That sounds like a good fit for our community, for sure.

692
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,720
Yeah.

693
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,720
Okay.

694
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,880
I want to dig into something different, maybe similar, maybe different.

695
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,880
So when you announced that you were joining Contentful, you pinned a tweet.

696
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:17,320
And part of that tweet is that you mentioned that this was after the long break.

697
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:24,320
So it made me curious about what was the reason behind that long break?

698
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,280
Because let me preface this by why I find that interesting.

699
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:36,720
I personally have had many, many struggles and continue to do with mental health in general,

700
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,220
anxiety, things like this.

701
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,920
And sometimes it gets to you.

702
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,920
It drains you.

703
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,920
It makes you tired and you do feel like you need a break.

704
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,240
Not always possible.

705
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:55,040
Sometimes you have to grin and bear through it, but sometimes you're either going to take

706
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,080
that break or your body's going to force you to take that break in unpleasant ways.

707
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,720
So I was curious, and I've spoken to other people also where burnout's been real.

708
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,360
Like Ian Douglas is somebody I spoke to that almost quit tech because he was so burned

709
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,360
out.

710
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:14,880
So I was curious if maybe there are echoes of that in the story.

711
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,000
So if you want to dig into that.

712
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Yeah.

713
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Yeah.

714
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm lucky.

715
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,320
It's never been like a forced thing.

716
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
I was getting tired.

717
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,920
Like, I mean, let's be real.

718
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,040
Like the world is upside down and has been for two years.

719
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,040
So that doesn't help.

720
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,080
But yeah, I was, yeah, I feel like I just wanted to change.

721
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:44,320
So before, as I said in the intro, I was like a regular front end developer and I wanted

722
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,980
to become a developer advocate.

723
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:53,120
So I applied to a bunch of places and then luckily Contentful said yes, which was fantastic.

724
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:59,560
And yeah, so in between leaving my old job, which was very hard, like I really liked my

725
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,880
team and everything, but I felt like I needed to change.

726
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,320
I was getting a little, yeah, a little tired of the whole thing.

727
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,520
Like, yeah, just like, yeah, like mental health wise, it became harder.

728
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:16,560
I feel like they're probably, as you said, just like accumulation of the, you know, the

729
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,080
last two or three, the last two odd years.

730
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,520
Yeah.

731
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,680
So in between, I made sure to have some time off in between my last job at the Wall Street

732
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,940
Journal and Contentful.

733
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:38,040
So yeah, so I had about five weeks ish between, I don't have the dates right, but like about

734
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,040
five weeks between.

735
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,040
So it's not that long.

736
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,480
It's long, especially if you compare it to like in America where they have like two weeks

737
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,480
and that's it.

738
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,480
That's it for the year.

739
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,480
That's all you take off.

740
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,080
But yeah, so it's long, but it's not extremely long.

741
00:51:53,080 --> 00:52:00,320
And during those five weeks, four or five weeks again, I went on the big road trip around

742
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,120
the UK and it was fantastic.

743
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,720
So yeah, that's how it, there was a really clean, may not be that long a break, but it

744
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:13,280
was a very clean break because I didn't basically didn't, almost didn't code for like three

745
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,440
weeks and it was just a completely, a complete change in that environment as well.

746
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Okay, cool.

747
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,600
Thanks for sharing that.

748
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:27,680
So I think in closing, and this one leads kind of nicely into it, why do you enjoy doing

749
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,680
outside of the tech world?

750
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,200
I know a lot of times the answer is I still do tech.

751
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,760
If that's the case, that's fine, but I'm curious, like what do you do when you're not doing

752
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,760
tech?

753
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:40,760
Yeah.

754
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,760
Yeah.

755
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,120
So there's, like everyone else, I really like like traveling.

756
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:55,400
I'm lucky that I get to do a lot more of that now as a developer advocate, which is fantastic.

757
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,360
I like things to do with music, as I alluded to earlier with like my failure to be good

758
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:06,680
at any musical instruments, so like playing it, listening to it, attending concerts.

759
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,800
Another thing is, I guess, kind of like your answer a little bit is that I just like learning

760
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,120
about things on the internet in general.

761
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,480
So it's not necessarily coding.

762
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,080
Like I have a side project like everyone else, let's not be, let's not lie there.

763
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,440
Sometimes I have multiple and you know, it happens.

764
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,240
But yeah, I just like getting into like random topics, like in like I think for about like

765
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:36,160
maybe about a year now, I've got really into like musical theater and I just learned everything

766
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,560
as much as I could about it and like learning the history of it, how different like composers

767
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:47,680
like relate to each other and like just musically also was just extremely rich discovery.

768
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,640
So like stuff like that, I also really like, which is kind of like doing tech a little

769
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,120
bit, but not exactly.

770
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,120
Yeah.

771
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,120
Yeah.

772
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,120
What is it about travel that you enjoy?

773
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:03,800
I mean, it's a pretty, I guess, standard answer is like you're, well, it takes you out of

774
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:09,560
your environment, which is great also for like, you know, it's for your mind and everything

775
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,560
else.

776
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,240
Like that's really good to, you know, to see other things and it's just, you know, learning

777
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:22,440
about like and seeing just how other cultures work, how, you know, every, you know, every

778
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,440
country works.

779
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,080
You can, you also see a lot of blind spots, which is interesting of like stuff you didn't

780
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,960
think about when you come to another country, you're like, oh my God, they totally fixed

781
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,960
it.

782
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,080
Or like, oh my God, this thing is absolutely terrible in this country.

783
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,520
How did like, we figured this, we figured this out 10 years ago.

784
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,440
How come this country hasn't, but like, it goes both ways.

785
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,840
And yeah, it's just, it's just really good for, you know, just your mind and also just

786
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:53,280
seeing different things, like, you know, in like seeing completely different nature and

787
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,800
like different people, customs, it's just so interesting.

788
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,800
Yeah.

789
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,800
I agree.

790
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,280
I wish I didn't have as much of an impact on our carbon footprint as it does.

791
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:11,200
And I mean, sometimes, sometimes you can find beauty and uniqueness within your own country

792
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:17,400
and you don't have to necessarily get on a plane, not, not unless you're driving an electric

793
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,400
car.

794
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,760
It's not like cars don't have an impact on, but I think they have less of an impact, less

795
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,520
of a carbon footprint than a, than a big ass airplane.

796
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,560
Oh, thank you so much, Alvin.

797
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,240
This has been really a good conversation.

798
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:37,440
I enjoyed it and I'm kind of sad to be, you have to end it a little early, probably, probably

799
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:45,480
get going for a while, but yeah, I am going to die without electricity and internet for

800
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
a while.

801
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,400
So there's a problem that we haven't solved that a lot of other countries have solved.

802
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Yep.

803
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:56,160
But yeah, thank you so much for, for taking some time out of your day to speak with me.

804
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,960
I really appreciate it.

805
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,860
And I'm going to look into a lot of these things that you've mentioned and I'll be following

806
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,520
all your work on Twitter and Polywork and everywhere where you are.

807
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
Thanks so much.

808
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
No, thank you.

809
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,400
And I'm happy to be on again, you know, to have another, another chat for sure.

810
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,400
Thank you so much for having me.

811
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,400
For sure.

812
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,400
It's a huge pleasure.

813
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,400
